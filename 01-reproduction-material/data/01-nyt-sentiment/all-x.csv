"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Just hours before the unemployment benefits fund was to run out in South Carolina, the state with the nation’s third-highest jobless rate, .,Gov. Mark Sanford relented .Wednesday and agreed to apply ,fpr a $146 million federal loan to shore it up, after weeks of refusing to do so."
"„ The governor's position had drawn rebukes even from fellow Republicans in the Legislature, one of whom denounced Mr. Sanford, as “heartless,” and from Newspaper editorial pages. On Wednesday, The State, the daily inewspaper here in Columbia, accused the governor of playing ,'jchicken with the lives of the 77,000” who are unemployed in .South Carolina. ."
"For weeks, Mr. Sanford, pewly .elected as head of the Republican Governors Association and iknown for being a fierce free-[Riarket foe of govern."" ant spending, stuck to his stand, questioning the probity of the South Caro-Jina Employment Security Com-itnission and demanding a new audit of the agency."
"» He has said in the past that he did not trust the commission’s calculation of the state’s unemployment rate, though a spokesman at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was calculated the same way as in every other state. !•; Mr. Sanford is now demanding that South Carolina’s Commerce Department, whose director ho ^appoints, be given access to .the .state unemployment agency’s Slumbers, including where applicants are from, their ages, genders and occupations."
"The back-and-forth dueling between the conservative governor (and the unemployment agency ;Jias gone on for weeks, and its executive director, Roosevelt T. Jfalley, warned that he would jiave to stop issuing benefit ; checks to the jobless beginning Jan. 1 if Mr. Sanford did not back down and ask the federal government for the loan."
"The steel industry, having entered the recession in the best of health, is emerging as a leading indicator of what lies ahead. As steel production goes — and it is now in collapse — so will go the national economy."
"That maxim once applied to Detroit’s Big Three car companies, when they dominated American manufacturing. Now they are losing ground in good times and bad, and steel has re- • placed autos as the industry to watch for an early sign that a severe recession is beginning to lift."
"The industry itself is turning to government for orders that, until the September collapse, had come from manufacturers and builders. Its executives are waiting anxiously for details of President-elect Barack Obama’s stimulus plan, and adding their voices to pleas for a huge public investment program — up to $1 trillion over two years — intended to lift demand for steel to build highways, bridges, electric power ., grids, schools, hospitals, water treatment plants and rapid transit ,	."
"“What we are asking,” said Daniel R. DiMicco, chairman and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a giant steel maker, ""is that our government deal with the worst economic slowdown in our lifetime through a recovery program that has in every provision a'buy America’clause.”"
"WASHINGTON - Presidentelect Barack Obama's economic recovery plan ran into crossfire from His own party in Congress on Thursday, suggesting that quick passage of spending programs and tax cuts could require more time and negotiation than Democrats once'nop ed."
Senate Democrats complained that major components of his plan were not bold enough and urged more focus on creating jobs and rebuilding the nation’s energy infrastructure rather than cutting taxes.
"Just hours earlier, Mr. Obama called for speedy passage of the stimulus measure, Warning that the recession “could linger for years” if Congress did not pass his plan within weeks."
"Further complicating the picture, Democratic senators said Thursday that they would try to attach legislation to the package that would allow bankruptcy courts to modify home loans, a move Republicans have opposed. [Page Bi.] ulus plan, the Obama team has also been considering how to use the second $350 billion of the bailout program approved by Congress. A transition team official said Thursday night that the new approach would give government officials broader range to provide relief on consumer loans for homes, automobiles and education, while also doing more to address foreclosures and the problems of municipalities and small businesses."
"S-For his recovery plan, meanwhile, Mr. Obama has been assembling a package worth as ftnuch as $775 billion over two years to revive the sagging economy, using the plan to define his presidency even before it begins |ind to foreshadow his broader approach to governing, r While relying on traditionally liberal notions of using government spending to spur growth, he has also tried to adapt it for a new era with investment in clean energy and technology. And he is trying to balance all of that with tax breaks that appeal to Republicans."

"Plummeting tax and fare revenues that have been depressed further by the ailing economy could increase the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s budget deficit this year by $650 million, according to a new estimate made public on Monday. If the doomsday forecast is borne out, the authority’s deficit this year could grow to nearly $2 billion."
"The authority has already proposed a steep increase in fares and deep service cuts if it does not get a state bailout. But if its finances worsen significantly, it could be forced to take even more drastic measures."
"“This is obviously breathtaking,” Gary Dellaverson, the authority’s chief financial officer, said as he presented the projections to a meeting of the authority board’s finance committee."
"Transit officials also said that average weekday subway ridership declined 2 percent in January compared with the same month last year, probably because of shrinking employment in the region. It was the first time that that measure of subway ridership had fallen since 2003, except in months where the drop was attributed to bad weather or quirks of the calendar, like holidays falling on weekdays."
"Lower ridership also means less money collected in fares, worsening the authority’s fiscal straits. In January, the subway system recorded an average of"
"WASHINGTON - Even as they continued to hash out the details of a nearly S800 billion economic recovery plan, aides to President-elect Barack Obama on Sunday began lobbying a reluctant Congress to release the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund."
"The request is certain to generate angry debate on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are reeling from last week’s projection of a $1.2 trillion budget deficit and will also soon be asked to vote on Mr. Obama's $800 billion recovery package."
WASHINGTON — The rising unemployment rate is giving President Obama’s critics an opportunity to raise questions about the effectiveness of his recovery plan and his economic leadership. The huge budget def-h icit is focusing fresh concern on J:tne national aeui.
"D A little less than four months -after he signed the $787 billion ,, American Recovery and Re-j! investment Act into law, Mr. Oba-i,ma is now in the position of try-j ing to convince Americans that the stimulus measure — his sig-,, nature legislative achievement „thus far — is working, even as the job losses mount."

"MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s economy is being dragged down by the recession to the north. American addicts have turned Mexico into a drug superhighway, and its police and soldiers are under assault from American guns. Nafta promised 15 years ago that Mexican- trucks would, be allowed on American roads, but Congress said they were unsafe."
"other side as well. Many American communities are worried about drug violence spilling over the border, and about Mexican immigrants taking scarce jobs. That is forcing the Obama administration, already managing two wars and a deep recession, to fashion a new Mexico policy earlier than it might have wished."
"The 67-acre development on the Strip consists of six towers with 2,392 apartments, as many as 5,900 hotel rooms, a casino, and a shopping center and entertainment complex. Some of the world’s renowned architects have designed buildings for the project. Envisioned as a self-contained community, it will have its own fire department and power plant."
"Because of the credit crisis, City-Center’s owners found themselves in September 2008 unable to obtain several billion dollars that they had anticipated in loans from a consortium led by Bank of America. Though a $1.8 billion loan was eventually offered, the owners had to finance much of the project with their own cash. They had almost finished five towers when new problems erupted in February."

"""This is the largest decline in the first year of a recession we’ve seen since the Census Bureau started collecting data after World War II,"" said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, referring to household incomes. ""We’ve seen a lost decade for the typical American family.” The share of American resi-, dents who said they lacked health insurance throughout the entire year remained steady, at 15.4 percent, or 46.3 million people. But the total masked some more worrisome trends that are helping to drive the debate over a national health care overhaul."

"The economy shrank at an accelerating pace late last year, the government reported on Friday, adding to the urgency of a stimulus package capable of bringing the country back from a recession that appears to be deepening."
"The actual decline in the gross domestic product — at a 3.8 percent annual rate — fell short of the 5 to 6 percent that most economists had expected for the fourth quarter. But that was because consumption collapsed so quickly that goods piled up in inventory, unsold but counted as part of the nation’s output."
"“The drop in spending was so fast, so rapid, that production could not.be cut fast enough,” said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at IHS Global Insight. ""That is happening now, and the contraction in the current quarter, as a result, will probably exceed 5 percent."""
"The dismal fourth quarter, and the likelihood of more of the same through the spring, are fueling discussion among policy makers and politicians over the best way to spend the soon-to-be-authorized federal money."

"BOSTON — Scores of legal aid societies that help poor people with noncriminal cases — like disputes over foreclosures, evictions and eligibility for unemployment benefits — are being forced to cut their staffs and services, even as requests for help have soared."
"In an odd twist, the societies have been hit hard by the Federal Reserve's steep reduction of its benchmark interest rate, which finally plunged last month to near zero."
"The rate decline, though generally welcomed as a blow against the recession, has had an unplanned and severe effect on legal aid societies, which depend heavily on revenues that are tied to the federal funds rate. As recently as 2007, the rate was more than 5 percent and legal aid agencies reaped more than $200 million for their operations."
"Now, for many legal aid groups across the country, cutbacks in staffing are expected to reach 20 percent or more over the coming months, even as requests for their services have risen by 30 percenter more."
"low-wage workers’ salaries commensurate with the cost of living, voters approved a change to the State Constitution that requires the minimum wage to be adjusted with inflation. As a result of the change, the minimum wage in Colorado has risen along with the cost of living. But this is the first time officials are faced with the prospect of lowering the wage to keep pace with a faltering economy. The federal minimum wage is S7.25 an hour, and it is illegal for most businesses in Colorado to pay workers less than that, so virtually all low-wage workers will see a drop of only 3 cents per hour. But advocates for poor Coloradoans say even that slight drop is enough to hurt people."

"One of the most controversial measures to be considered at the I recent session of the Legislature, the bill had been fought by both the State Federation of Labor and the State Congress of Industrial Organizations. They contended it would weaken the unemployment insurance fund, which is used to pay benefits to jobless workmen, and that it unduly favored larger business establishments."
The Young-Demo bill was virtually the only piece of major legislation on which Governor Dewey took no stand when it was before the Legislature. Its fate was uncertain until his approval of it was announced today. Mr. Dewey gave no reasons for his decision.
"Two major changes in existing law governing the granting of unemployment insurance tax credits are made by the bill, which was sponsored by Senator Fred A. Young and Assemblyman Benjamin Demo, both Republicans of Lewis County."

"The country should alter its fi-l nancial policy by curtailing: Government spending and reducing taxes to allow more money fo. capital investment before resorting to price controls in an effort to curb inflation. So said James L. Rogers, president of the American Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association, at the opening session of a three-day meeting of the association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel yesterday."
"Mr. Rogers said that Attorney General Tom Clark in a recent address ""gave high praise for the drug industries’ success in holding prices down. He reported a price increase of 3.1 per cent on 7,000 drug store items during the period, 1939 to 1947.” Mr. Rogers also urged the manufacturers to ‘ continue to do research to the greatest possible extent and support all worthwhile research organizations in our field” in order that the drug industry may remain on its present high plane and come to ‘‘greater heights of usefulness and service ;al care under Government control far below the general average that prevails in the United States.

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1—President Trumap was urged today in a report of his Council of Economic Advisers to seek renewal of some war-time powers to deal with a threatened inflation of industrial prices under the combined impact of heavy domestic demand and a $20,000,000,000 European recovery program."
The report warned that serious inflation already existed in prices of food and steel. It said the nation’s ability to support a European recovery program of the proportions contemplated already had been demonstrated but warned of serious trouble ahead unless “firm measures” were taken to counteract current trends.
On receipt of the report. President Truman issued a public statement calling attention to the fact that it and the report on national resources and foreign aid by the Secretary of Interior Julius A. Krug found that the United States had the resources and economic and financial capacity to support a considerable European aid program.
"Mr. Truman said these reports and other pertinent material would be the basis for his recommendations to Congress. Today, again, Mr. Truman limited his callers to a minimum and continued his work on the message to the session of Congress opening on Nov. 17. In this message he will outline a program for checking inflation and aiding Europe."
Strategists of both parties saw as one aim of the President's proposals to combat the inflationary spiral a gesture to mollify the rebellious leftist fringe within the Democratic party that has been flirting with the idea of a third party. It was thought that a particular concession was made by the President in asking for the imposition of price controls on items in scarce supply.
"For the Republicans, Carroll Reece, national chairman of the party, asked what had made the President change his mind about the need for price controls."

"The imposition of wartime controls upon a peacetime economy would “go far to upset our economy” and would continue a state of scarcity, Morris Sayre, the NAM president told the Senate Banking Committee, conducting hearings on a number of anti-inflation bills."
"On the other hand, John Middle-kamp, appearing for the Automobile Manufacturers Association and as a spokesman for the automotive industry, described controls as “a boomerang in the battle against inflation” and held controls would only impede production, increase price and foster inflation."
"Industry’s anti-inflation program, Mr. Sayre told the committee, calls for reduction of government spending and taxing, and systematic retirement of the public debt. Labor is asked to forego demands for further general wage increases without corresponding i increases in productivity and to set aside all featherbedding rules and unnecessary restrictions on individual productivity."
"Reading in THE Times of Jan. 1 th« New Year’s message of Treasury Secretary John W. Snyder that individual' saving is America’s “most potent weapon in combating inflation,” r found' myself intrigued but nonplused. For I; knew that today, with an insurance premium, several bills, and an income-tax installment coming due, I would have to draw upon what savings I had already accumulated. This morning, for the third time in six months, I took several war bonds from the safety-, deposit box and sold them across .the counter.	__"
"There are, to he sure, many persons whose income has greatly increased since Pearl Harbor and who are even-embarrassed by surplus funds. These may well heed Mr. Snyder’s injunction to save. But the Secretary overlooks the salaried professional man who fi£s spent much time and money in preparation for an expert vocation and’is grievously hit by inflated prices."
"With a salary which was adequate when Mr. Snyder took office and which has increased slightly since then, I, as a teacher, am now unable to make ends meet decently without using my savings. Our family of five live respectably but frugally, denying ourselves certain amenities which we took as normal a few years ago. My wife and I seek to hear our own weight and maintain insurance and annunity provisions sufficient to educate our children and provide for our old age without appeal to either charity or public relief funds. We consider this course indispensable to the true American tradition, but it is touch and go as to whether we can continue it."
"Many in the teaching profession are less fortunate. Some, for purely financial reasons, have had to leave college or university faculties to enter business or government. We wonder whether our fellow-citizens realize the toll which inflation has already taken from many persons and institutions whose distinctive contributions our country and the world definitely need.	“"
"Since last week two of the staples on today’s shopping list have gone up 10 per cent, an increase greater than that made by my bonds in the four years in which I had treasured them. I wonder where to find the individual savings which Mr. Snyder asked me to put aside to beat inflation."
"i The stock market lapsed yesterday into an indecisive stage accompanied by a contraction in business.

Grace, chairman, said that its price reductions would amount to $10,000,000 on an annual basis, but, like United States Steel, it did not report the specific reductions on the product involved. Jones & Laughlin and Youngstown Sheet and Tube did; not place a value on the reductions, I contemplated."
"“This is the first attempt of any union in this area to assist its members in combating high prices,” Mr. Annable said. He said further, that if successful, the local would introduce “many other necessities” to help meet today's increased living costs."
"WASHINGTON. July 30—President 'Truman continued today his demands on Congress for curbs against inflation, warning that avoidance of a “business collapse,” which he foresaw without his program, was prerequisite to a peaceful world."
"Mr. Truman was markedly more temperate in tone than in the message he personally delivered to Congress Tuesday, but the sense of economic urgency with which he viewed the “growing threats to our well-being” Was no less apparent."
"“I realize that the anti-inflationary program I have offered will impede some business plans, will curb some profit opportunities. and may liriiit some wage advances. It is of the very essence of a plan to counteract inflation that this be done. All groups will ultimately benefit when it is done."

"Commenting yesterday on the President's appointment of Paul Porter, former OPA head, as his adviser on anti-inflation legislation, we suggested that the move seemed almost deliberately calculated to destroy at the outset any hope of cooperation on legislation in this field. If the naming of Mr. Porter did not accomplish this result, then the bill introduced yesterday by Senator Barkley, presumably reflecting the ideas of this adviser, should certainly do so. If any measure ever was put forward by an Administration with its tongue in its cheek, this is such a measure. No intelligent Congress, Republican or Democratic, could possibly stomach this bill, and the Administration must know it."
"The proposed legislation includes the whole hodge-podge of recommendations contained in that part of the President's message dealing with rising prices and living costs. But that is not all. A pleasant surprise has been added by way of giving this legislation the authentic OPA touch. For it includes, as it were, an invitation to revisit that Alice in Wonderland of economics in which the country lived during the reign of OPA. That is the land of Let's Pretend, whose chief industries are statistics and regulations, in which high taxes and black market prices don't count, and where the basic philosophy is that inflation that you can't see can't hurt you."
"Those who may have wondered precisely what Mr. Porter's contribution to the anti-inflation campaign was going to be do not have to wonder any longer. The secret is out. Incredible as it may seem, the surprise is Price Roll-backs. Roll-backs would be applied to any cost-of-living item which has risen “or which threatens to rise"" 20 per cent or more since June, 1946 (when price controls were scrapped). Prices picked for the roll-back would remain under ceilings until June* 30,"
"There is no magic, of course, by which the Administration or any other human power can ""roll” prices back, by word of command, to some appointed level. The term “roll-back” is simply a euphemism to describe a process whereby a producer is induced to sell his product at an agreed price, with the difference between that price and the market price made up to him by government subsidies. And the cost of the subsidies? That, of course, is footed by the taxpayer."
"Subsidies are to be distrusted under any conditions, and distrusted particularly when they come, as they come in the case of price roll-backs, in disguise. But the proposal to reintroduce them into the American economy at the present time represents a new high in economic futility. Britain has been chided by her critics for spending almost two billions a year since the war to hold food prices down. We can be charged with the even greater folly of having spent similar amounts to keep farm prices up. But, never until now has it been seriously proposed, here or anywhere else, that a nation’s taxpayers shoulder the burden of subsidizing price inflation in one political area and price deflation in another, at one and the same time."
"Leaders of the Republican party in Congress returned President Truman's fire by radio tonight, describing his call of a special session as unnecessary and declaring that his anti-inflation proposals would make high prices per-1 manent."
"Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, chairman of the party’s Senate policy committee, promised that Congress would try to work out some cost-of-living curbs without resorting to “police state methods,” but he declared that “price I control and rationing will not work in America in time of peace.” Asserting that Congress was going to go home in about two weeks, he said that “we would be fully justified in adjourning at once.”"

"Many American companies are laying off workers now, rather than waiting to be hit by hard times as they have in the past. Some economists warn that this outburst of corporate preventive medicine increases the odds of a steep recession."
"The number of people laid off in the United States has increased sharply since June, reaching the levels of the early months of the 1981-82 recession. While some companies, including Citicorp, Digital Equipment and McDonnell Douglas, are acting because sales and profits have already begun to shrink, many others, including General Electric’s appliance division and Nordstrom department stores, are only anticipating such a downturn."
"“Businesses are scared and they are cutting costs in anticipation of what they think might happen,” said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ""That sort of costcutting keeps American companies competitive in the world marketplace. But pre-emptive layoffs can be self-fulfilling, frightening people into spending less, which further weakens the economy.”"
"The layoffs, and a smaller number of outright dismissals, in recent months have come in the service sector as well as in manufacturing, reflecting a new interest in cost-cutting, particularly among retailers and financial-services companies. Manufacturers have practiced this sort of cost-cutting for a decade to make themselves more competitive."
"If these principles are respected, it’s possible to raise $300 billion in revenues while, at the same time, taking steps that would be desirable even if there was no budget deficit. Here is the package that budget negotiators should settle on."
"“It’s a very quiet market,” said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. “Caution and profit taking are the watchwords of the day. The market has come a long way, and | there is a big number on Friday. At I this point people are unwilling to make purchases.”"
Most economists are expecting the employment numbers will show that economic conditions deteriorated further last month. A sharp decline in non-farm payroll employment and a fairly sizable increase in the unemployment rate are anticipated.
"A survey of economists about the employment report by MMS International, an economic information service company, shows that most are projecting a decline of 75,000 in nonfarm payroll employment and a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, from 5.7 percent in October."
"A sharp fall in stock prices yesterday reflected growing worries over the health of the economy, especially the erosion of corporate profits, as well as a stock market that has grown increasingly fragile, some traders and analysts say."
"The rapid plunge in prices, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 100 points in little more than an hour of trading, only to stabilize and end the day down by 56.44 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,904.70, came after a series of disappointing earnings reports from companies as diverse as Texas Instruments, the electronics company, and McDonald’s, the hamburger chain."
"Growing Apprehension The selling extended to virtually all stocks, with six stocks falling in price for every one that rose. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell by 6.30, or"
"The profit disappointments came at a time of growing apprehension about the health of the financial system — many large bank stocks are trading at their lowest levels in two years — that had generally not hurt the stock market up to now. While share prices were . | not as expensive, measured against ] such indicators as earnings and interest rates, as they were in the summer of 1987, they were approaching that level, according to many analysts."
"""The market had reached overvalued levels, the economy is sluggish, and corporate profits, while they are not horrendous, are well below the levels of expectations that were built into prices,” said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief American strategist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research."
"According to the Congress’s bipartisan Joint Committee on Tax, the net effect of the Republican tax proposal would be tax increases for Americans with incomes under $50,000 while those with incomes above $50,000 would receive tax cuts. The committee said Americans with incomes over $200,000 a year would receive a tax cut totaling $7.4 billion in the first year."
"The latest proposal by Democrats included a 20 percent surtax on the income taxes paid by people with incomes of more than $500,000 a year. The Associated Press reported. It would also double the taxes on beer and wine, as well as increasing the levy on distilled spirits. Also citing estimates by the Joint Committee on Tax, The Associated Press said the Democratic offer would lower by $4 billion the taxes paid by people with incomes below $20,000, while boosting them by $26.8 billion for everyone else."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 — A number of the country’s major railroads and railroad-related businesses are failing to pay large amounts of payroll taxes to the Federal Government to finance the unemployment, retirement and medical benefits for the industry’s workers, an audit indicates."
"There is a way to get the economy moving again fairly soon, but it is apparently not on anyone’s agenda. It is a tax on consumer spending — even in the face of the coming Presidential election."
With the recovery from the recession weak or nonexistent. White ouse and Congressional attention is on cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. But using tax cuts to give a short-run boost to the economy would be exactly the wrong way to try to cure the Government’s long-term fiscal problems.
"Because of the Reagan-era tax cuts and the absence of any consensus to cut spending, it appears that the Federal budget will be permanently in the red. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will still be 2 percent of the gross national product even after an economic recovery. Moreover, demand is growing for additional Federal spending, particularly for health care and edu-"
Policy makers thus face a dilemma. A tax cut is needed in the short run while an increase is required for the long run. But this trade-off can be avoided by a tax on consumption — a national sales tax — that would take effect on a specified date in the future.
"Suddenly politicians of every stripe are demanding a tax cut to ""fight the recession."" President Bush turned from opponent to enthusiast overnight. Democratic Congressional leaders called hearings for this week to explore their ideas and the President’s."
"The stampede tells us something about this country. It shows how addicted we are to fulfilling immediate desires, how unable to focus on longterm needs. It shows that we are still gripped by the faith of the Reagan years, though its ruinous effects are all about us: We believe that somewhere there is a free lunch."
"Cutting taxes now is a bad idea on every count. Because the Federal deficit is so high, everyone proposing a cut promises that his plan will . produce no net loss to the Treasury. If that is so, there will be no stimulus to the economy. Some other interest may be served — undoing the Reagan tax law’s tilt toward the rich, for example — but not fighting the recession."
"WASHINGTON. June 27 (AP) — The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims declined in the second week of June, the Labor Department reported today, supporting hopes the nation’s jobs market is on the upswing."
"“That trend was interrupted briefly,"" said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. “But it has been trending lower, suggesting that at least in some sectors, the jobs market is improving.”"
"Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, said, “We’re having a gradual ebbing, and that's consistent with the idea of recovery and further evidence that it’s manifesting itself in a better labor market.”"
"The jobless-claims report, which can be erratic from week to week, helps economists analyze whether companies are adding or laying off workers. The latest number shows that jobs are probably on the rise, but only slightly, said Sam Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities."
"Property-tax delinquencies in New York City are rising again, as they did during the 1970’s, when the city last underwent an economic crisis. But city officials do not expect a recurrence of the wave of the abandonments that destroyed neighborhoods across the South Bronx the last time around."
City officials see the increase — 38 percent in the 12 months ended June 30 — as a result of the real-estate slump and the reluctance of banks to lend to developers. Landlords unable to pay their bills are in effect using the city as a bank: “borrowing” money by not paying property taxes.
"New York City’s economy is in trouble. Unemployment is up 25 percent this year; nearly a million New Yorkers are now on welfare, the most in 15 years. Financial firms, including Morgan Stanley, an industry leader, are pondering leaving. And many other employers express revulsion over filthy streets, crime, aggressive panhandling and soaring drug use."
"Just as city policies didn't create the economic mess, neither will they eradicate it. The forces driving companies out of central business districts to the suburbs and beyond may subside, even reverse. If so, the city government will be a spectator to these trends, not a prime mover."
Yet the city need not wait passively for unknown tidal forces. Intelligent development policies can’t turn an economy right side up but they can improve the lives of millions. Long-term investment for the future might well spell the difference between prosperity and decay.
"To close $30 million of a $3.5 billion budget deficit forecast for fiscal 1992, Mayor Dinkins would suspend New York’s recycling program. But to abandon recycling, however briefly, is to threaten the city’s long-term capacity to handle waste."
"4AS the recession drags on, entrepreneurs across America are trying their best to m & make a buck off it. One of them is 28-year-old Carylin Berger, manager of Stand-Up New York, a comedy club on Manhattan's Upper West Side."

"After an emcee warmed up the house, the first would-be Jay Leno took the microphone at 9 P.M. Richard Eastman, an out-of-work book editor, smoothed his straight blond hair anxiously as he strode onstage. His face seemed ashen against the white-painted brick wall. “Unemployment is becoming a lot more popular these days,” he began. “1 read in the paper every morning that more and more people are getting into it.”"
"Among them are lower interest rates, which provide fewer attractive investments; calmer mutual fund investors, who did not stampede out of stock funds over the weekend, and curbs on institutional trading."
The nearly 4 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on F riday ended a week in which economic data seemed to provide evidence that any revival of the economy is still weeks or months away.
"Banks across the country responded immediately and reduced their prime rate, the rate that determines the cost of many mortgages and other consumer and commercial loans, to 7>/i percent from 8 percent, the lowest since 1987. Credit card rates will probably not be affected, but the lower bank rates could save money for people who plan to borrow money to meet Christmas expenses."
"Last week the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate jumped to 6.8 percent in March, its highest level in more than four years. About 2 million Americans have lost their jobs since last summer, more than 700,000 since January."
"Along with the bad news came a cascade of sour predictions that a quick end to the recession “is not in sight” That may be so, but the unemployment rate is about the last place to look. The rate is included in the Government’s index of lagging indicators — meaning that the unemployment rate keeps rising even after the recession is over."
"As the economy begins to recover, companies typically raise production without adding to their payrolls. New hires take place only after employers are convinced the recovery will last."
"American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier and the airline that is considered a leader in determining fares, initiated a broad range of price cuts yesterday in the hope of attracting travelers put off by the gulf war and the recession. But it also raised some fares in an attempt to compensate for revenue lost through the many reductions."
"But that strategy has had an unintended but equally profound secondary effect. It has devastated the city’s poor black neighborhoods, whose residents thrived in the high-wage union jobs of the city’s manufacturing heyday and are now adrift on a rising tide of unemployment, crime and despair."
"With black joblessness five times the rate among whites, “Milwaukee is a classic case of how a restructured economy has diminished the employment opportunities for blacks and for black males in particular,” said Dr. James H.

"LAS VEGAS, Nev., Dec. 29 — For some time Las Vegas has purveyed an escapist world of fantasy and gambling and a view of itself as largely resistant to national recessions."
"Now, the recession has finally hit the Strip, just as it has Atlantic City in New Jersey. There are more visitors than ever under the neon glare, but they are gambling less and spending less. The casinos’ take has dropped substantially in recent months, local home sales are down from the torrid 1990 pace, and unemployment is up. Even the high rollers are lying low; baccarat play is down by a third."
"""It is pretty clear the recession is finally catching up with Las Vegas,” said Alan Feldman, spokesman for the new Mirage Hotel, one of the few hotel-casinos that have thus far weathered the downturn Well. “Whether it will be a serious or mild effect, the jury is still out.”"

"WASHINGTON, May 2 — The Bush Administration and Congressional Democrats are battling again over extra unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless, with Congress apparently determined to make permanent changes in the law and the Administration preferring only another shortterm extension."
"Both men said they would press for permanent statutory changes that would make extended benefits available in recessions much more readily than they are now. Such changes, they said, would be fairer and would keep Congress from having to pass emergency extensions every few months."
"Mr. Bush would like to enact another one-time extension of unemployment benefits, which are scheduled to lapse July 4, for at least 13 more weeks. But the House voted 261 to 150 on Tuesday night to replace the current system of irregular extensions of benefits with one that would automatically grant at least 13 extra weeks of benefits in states where the unemployment rate was 6 percent or higher. In addition, it would immediately provide 20 or 26 more weeks of emergency unemployment benefits."
"WASHINGTON, April 27 — As part of an election-year assault on regulations that it says are choking economic recovery, the Bush Administration has proposed limiting a rule that environmentalists have used to block logging on millions of acres of national forests."
"When bands stop playing at college graduation ceremonies this spring, members of the class of '92, who came of age in a recession, will doff caps and gowns and enter one of the toughest job markets that any class has seen in decades."
"Studies by two universities indicate that nearly one-third of the nation’s entry-level jobs for new graduates have evaporated during the recession as many large employers have reduced their hiring. At the same time, the market is already glutted with nearly a million unemployed managers and professional workers."
"The class of '92 has been hearing about the dismal job market for three years, and, college placement officials say, its members seem better prepared for a grueling job search than the last two classes."

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (AP) — New claims for unemployment benefits jumped sharply early this month and housing starts fell in October, the Government said today in reports that were seen as evidence of a temporary setback for the economy."
"31,000,	to 386,000, for the week that ended on Nov. 7, the Labor Department said. It was the biggest increase in three months and the highest level of claims in six weeks."
"Housing starts fell 1.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million, the Commerce Department said. Housing starts had risen in August and September."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 — In an election-year budget of $1.52 trillion, President Bush called today for modest increases in a wide range of popular domestic programs, but he avoided any major change in spending priorities to fight the recession."
"Hoping to breathe life into a listless economy, Mr. Bush proposed tax breaks for investors, home buyers, businesses and families with children. His proposals turned out to be less drastic than some of the tax cuts considered by his advisers over the last two months."
"LONDON, Jan. 29 — Like President Bush, with whom he will have dinner in New York on Thursday night, Prime Minister John Major of Britain has to face an election this year in almost the worst possible economic circumstances: a recession whose end is not yet in sight."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 — The economy grew at a surprisingly brisk pace of 2.7 percent in the July-September period, the Commerce Department reported today. This was the sixth consecutive quarterly advance in gross domestic product, the most comprehensive measure of economic activity within American borders."
The dollar value of the output surpassed the pre-recession peak registered in the 1990 second quarter.
"And specialists working in the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, noted that growth in the last six quarters had averaged 1.8 percent — less than one-third the rate for comparable periods in the other eight postwar recoveries. They said the third-quarter advance could not be sustained."
"“The long recession is over,” asserted Lawrence A. Hunter, chief economist for the United Stales Chamber of Commerce. “The jump in February housing starts and industrial production — in addition to markedly improved business confidence and retail sales — signal a clear turning point for the economy."""
"Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1,304,000 during the' month, the Commerce Department re- ported. The pace was 9.6 percent above that of January, which itself was substantially stronger than first estimated. The broadly based gain also raised the pace of housing starts to the fastest in nearly two years."
"And at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities, output was up six-tenths of 1 percent in February after falling in each of the three preceding months, the Federal Reserve reported. A rebound in production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for about half the gain."
"You’d think that by now Ross Perot could keep a few basic facts in his very own head. We’re not disking for much, just a few numbers that would help ordinary folks understand how he intends to do the one thing he says Bill Clinton can’t do, which is to bring the budget deficit to zero. After all, this is a man who’s been talking economics day and night for two years, usually with a pointer and charts. But without the charts, Mr. Perot can’t remember a thing."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 — Three Democratic Congressional leaders said today that a tax cut for the middle class, one of President-elect Bill Clinton’s major campaign promises, might have to be put off because of the soaring Federal budget deficit."
"Their tone made it clear that the Congressional Democrats, who twice passed bills with middle-class tax cuts last year in efforts to embarrass President Bush, would not hold Mr. Clinton’s feet to the same fire and would support his economic proposals, whether or not they emerge with promised tax cuts."
"On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton’s spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, used the new, sharply higher Bush Administration estimate of the 1997 deficit — $305 billion instead of the $237 billion it had forecast in July — to suggest that it might not be possible for Mr. Clinton to keep his promise to cut the deficit in 'half in four years."
"Mr. Stephanopoulos did not mention the deficit’s impact on the tax-cut pledge and would not discuss it directly ■when asked about it today, saying instead, “As circumstances change, you imust examine every part of the pro-jgram.” | A top Republican, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said [today that Mr. Clinton should have iknown by late summer that the deficit was going to be larger than the Administration’s July estimate, and he indicated that he thought Mr. Clinton would 'have to raise, not lower, taxes."
"Commerce Secretary Ronald ' H.; Brown and some private-sector economists attributed the deterioration to economic stagnation abroad, which reduces demand for American goods, and continued growth in the United States, which leaves Americans better able to afford imports."
"But now, recent signs, of weakness notwithstanding, the recovery that began in the nation’s center seems to be fanning out to the rest of the country. Exports to Latin America and tourists from Europe are helping to revive Florida and the rest of the Southeast. Stronger car sales have given a lift to parts of the Midwest, although recent floods could cause a temporary setback. In Texas and other South Central states, service businesses and high-technology manufacturing are expanding. A few Western states have been growing so fast that businesses are running out of people to hire."
"In deeply depressed California and the rest of the Pacific Southwest, sales and income tax collections have stopped shrinking and business people say the economy may have touched bottom. The northern New England states are growing again, and there are signs of life even in Connecticut, which is still reeling from military cutbacks. And New Jersey has started to regain some of the jobs it lost."
"The extent of the spreading recovery is mirrored in a variety of broad economic statistics. Employment — though still shrinking in a few states — is higher this year in all but one region, the South Central states, than it was in the first half of last year. Help-wanted advertising, a sensitive indicator of changes in the job market, has turned up in seven of the nine regions in the last three months, though it is still far below its pre'fecession peak."
"And while factory employment, historically a source of good jobs, has dropped to its lowest point since the mid-1960’s, in most regions industrial production has recovered to pre-recession levels. This means more profits and wages for manufacturers and workers."
"A drop in oil prices to their lowest levels in five years rippled through the stock market yesterday, dragging down shares in big oil producers while buoying those of transportation companies."
"Most stocks inched forward in a subdued session that ended early because of the holiday weekend, but the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.63, to 3,683.95. The index was depressed by Chevron, down 4V4, to 85%; Texaco, down 1%, to 63%, and Exxon, down 1%, to 61%. For the week, the Dow dropped 10.06 points."
"Falling oil prices lifted shares of companies whose businesses consume large amounts of fuel. The Dow Jones transportation average shot up 28.85 points, to 1,739.89. And in the bond market, where the prospect of an easing of inflationary pressure heartened ^traders, prices also rose and interest rates fell. |Page 39.) Discord at OPEC"

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 — With the notable exception of California, the economy showed continued improvement in December and early January, with sizable gains in retail sales augmented by better activity in factories and residential construction, a survey published today by the Federal Reserve Board said."
"Finally emerging from the recession, nearly all the stptes are planning their first budgets in years without big tax increases or deep cuts in programs."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 — Responding quickly to new projections of larger deficits from President Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton appeared today to back off his campaign pledge to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years."
"In Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton said the new figures, issued today by the White House as part of Mr. Bush's final budget, were an “unsettling revelation."" But in the campaign, Mr. Clinton was repeatedly told by his advisers that the deficit would be larger than "" acknowledged by Mr. Bush or assumed by Mr. Clinton in his campaign manifesto."
"Mr. Clinton and his aides seemed to be using the new estimates of the deficit from the Bush White House to begin revising Mr. Clinton’s campaign promises. The Clinton stance also suggested the possibility that the President-elect wanted to lay early political groundwork for unpopular measures to cut the growth of spending, or even perhaps to raise some taxes."
"Aides to Mr. Clinton said that he still wanted to halve the deficit, but that it would probably take more than four years to achieve that goal. “It would be imprudent to go too far on deficit reduction so you put the economy in a tailspin,” said a member of Mr. Clinton's transition team."
"Mr. Bush’s budget for the fiscal year 1994, which begins Oct. 1, shows Federal spending of $1.5 trillion, equal to nearly one-fourth of the nation’s total output of goods and services. It shows a deficit of $292.4 billion in 1994, rising to $305 billion in 1997."
"White House officials, who had privately maintained until recently that short-term rates above 4 percent would be unacceptable, quickly retreated from that position today as it seemed increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve would breach that level soon."
"The Federal Reserve’s stance means that investors, who have been trading in declining, turbulent markets the last month, may not be able to find comfort even if monthly inflation reports continue to show that current price increases are moderate, as was Indicated by the data for March issued this week. Despite the positive numbers, the Federal Reserve will still be leaning toward pushing short-term interest rates higher."
"In an Op-Ed article in Friday's issue of The New York Times, Laura D’Andrea Tyson, who heads the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, argues that inflation is in check and that “the financial markets appear to be reacting more to inflation myths than to realities.’’ |Page A31.)"
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 — As the United States economy's growth continues unabated 10 months after the Federal Reserve began trying to slow it, more and more economists are concluding that the central bank’s all-purpose tool, raising or lowering interest rates, is not as effective as it used to be."
"To these economists and to a number of former Fed officials, figures like those in the Labor Department's report Friday showing a sharp drop in unemployment last month signal a quiet erosion of the Fed’s influence."
"No one questions the tremendous power the Fed can wield if it raises interest rates sharply or keeps them high for a long time. But changes in the country’s financial system, notably the declining role of banks as providers of money for companies and consumers, may make it necessary for the Fed to make bigger increases or to wait longer to get the same effect, they say."
"Last month, for instance, the Fed abandoned the pattern of quarter-point or half-point increases it had followed since February, instead pushing up the rates that banks pay for short-term borrowing by three-quarters of a percentage point, its biggest increase in 13 years."
The stock and bond markets fell sharply amid growing concerns that long-term Interest rates are likely to continue rising. Page Dl.
Interest rates surged again yesterday as traders and investors continued to worry about the steady pace of economic growth and inflation. But the Federal Reserve tried to play down their concerns.
"Long-term interest rates jumped to an eight-month high, with the yield on the 30-year bond finishing at 6.73 percent. Shorter-term rates also shot higher, with the yield on the three-year note at 5.07 percent, its highest since December 1992."
"In an effort to cut off a jump in inflation before it began, the Federal Reserve raised its target for shortterm interest rates to 3.25 percent from 3 percent on Feb. 4. But rather than reassuring traders and investors, the move seemed to create new concern about inflation, and long-"
"The Government has changed the way it determines the national unemployment rate, which has resulted in a number that is marginally higher. But the new and supposedly improved methodology does not provide anything close to an accurate picture of a devastating jobs crisis that is becoming ever more entrenched."
"Legions of Americans who once felt secure in the workplace are now stunned to find themselves caught in the hideous undertow of long-term unemployment. You don’t hear much from them after that. The jobless tend to go quietly. One day they’re at their work station, the next day they’re not. When enough time passes, they’re no longer even counted as unemployed."
"If you take this group, which increasingly includes middle-class and middle-aged men and women, and link it up with the people who have been forced into part-time or temporary work, and with people who are calling themselves self-employed but who are really making little or no money, and with the underclass of inner-city Americans who have long been among the permanently unemployed, you have a problem with frightening implications."
"You cannot deal effectively with public safety, health care reform and welfare reform without engaging the employment crisis."
"In November 1991, when President Bush signed a bill extending jobless benefits, there were 1.3 million Americans officially designated as longterm unemployed, meaning they had been out of work for six months or longer. Those benefits have been cut back, but last month the number of long-term unemployed was 1.7 million."
"Squeezed by the rigid spending ceilings that'were enacted last year to lower the budget deficit, the House of Representatives has approved only a fraction or the new money President Clinton sought this year for his main domestic initiatives."
"prised by the Administration’s relatively laid-back behavior today. Some viewed it as a gutsy high-risk strategy to convince the market that the dollar’s fall was ndt justified by economic fundamentals, much like a doctor allowing a patient to heal naturally before trying more drastic intervention."
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — America's trade deficit with the rest of the world rose sharply in July to the second-highest level in history, the Government said today in a report that fanned inflation fears, rattled the financial markets and depressed the value of stocks, bonds and the dollar."
"The worse-than-expected trade report came as Japanese auto companies, in a highly unusual move, warned the Clinton Administration that they might break off their cooperation with the American auto industry, particularly their purchases of American auto parts, if the White House imposed trade sanctions on- Japan."
"There was some positive news on trade matters for the Administration today, though. The Japanese Finance Ministry informed Washington that the Government in Tokyo intended to put off imposing a consumption tax for three years instead of the two-year delay originally planned. A longer delay in the tax should help stimulate the Japanese economy and the purchase of American goods by Japanese consumers."
"When the Fed raises rates to combat inflation, rates on loans paid by ..consumers follow. Yesterday's Fed increase was the sixth this year. Here is how the first five affected the cost of some sample loans."
The Federal Reserve’s decision to Increase Interest rates by the largest amount In years intensified a debate that focuses not so much on the amount of the rise but whether the Federal Reserve should have ucted at all.
"On one side ure those who applauded the Federal Reserve's action, most of them on Wall Street. They are challenged by an unlikely coalition of manufacturers and labor leaders who charged that yesterday’s Increase would slow the economy loo much, cutting back sales and eliminating jobs."
"If we require some perpetual proportion of Americans to be unemployed, they must either starve to death or live as “parasites” off government entitlements or private charity. If we end welfare, and private charities do not replace these entitlement payments, three dreadful scenarios are possible."
"Under this scenario of starving the unemployed, additional employed survivors must continually be sacrificed. Then, as Keynes noted in a slightly different context, “in the long run we’ll all be dead.”"
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 — After three days of intense negotiations with top Mexican officials, the United States is preparing to announce details of a plan to bail the country out of a continuing currency crisis, including newly toughened restrictions that are likely to send already high Mexican interest rates soaring."
"Also included in the draft of an agreement here is a toughening of a highly controversial condition that Washington is placing on the Mexicans: The United States would effectively control the flow of the billions of dollars that Mexico earns every year from the export of its oil, starting in the next few months."
"Morrison Knudsen jolted the stock market when the troubled construction giant announced that its 1994 losses would be far larger than expected and that its acting chairman, William P. Clark, was resigning."
"The Morrison Knudsen Corporation jolted the stock market yesterday with a double dose of bad news: Its 1994 losses are far larger than its recent pessimistic forecasts. And its acting chairman, William P. Clark, is resigning from the giant construction conjpany’s board to return to his consulting business."
"The stock market declined yesterday, with signs abounding that last week’s upward momentum had been turned around. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 12.78 points to close at 3,869.43."
"The market was weighed down by inflation concerns prompted by a report showing a brisk pace in housing starts and by a surge in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The reports solidified the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which could slow the economy as well as raise corporate borrowing costs. In addition, a weak dollar, sharply lower bond prices and a slew of bad corporate news helped to push stock prices downward."
"Yesterday’s session was also a ""double witching,” when options on individual stocks and options on stock indexes expire simultaneously. These expirations, which fostered a great deal of computer-guided program trading on Thursday as well, contributed to volatility."
"""The day’s market activity was evidence of an economy that is not cooling as fast as had been thought as recently as last week,” said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. ""Obviously the outside influences were reasons for many investors to take profits."""
"The consensus among market analysts is that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by one-half of a percentage point when its policy-making group meets on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. A week ago, faced with a report showing sagging retail sales, some analysis were doubting that there would be any increase at all."
"In response, traders bought dollars and sold marks and yen. After falling to new lows in trading in Tokyo, the dollar recovered in trading in New York to 91.42 yen, from 90.05	on Tuesday, and to 1.3960 marks from 1.3705. Higher rates in the United States would make it more attractive for foreigners to invest in dollars, while lower rates in Germany would help reduce the flow of money into German marks."
"In testimony to the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan described the fall of the dollar as “unwelcome and troublesome,” as well as excessive, and said the Fed would notolet inflation be driven up by a weak currency."
"WASHINGTON, March 22 — In an ominous sign for the economy and the Clinton Administration, the nation’s trade deficit soared by two-thirds in January to a record $12.23 billion."
"There was strong evidence that the United States' usual imbalance, caused largely by Asian nations that export far more to this country than they buy in return, was being worsened as Mexico, recently a major importer of American goods, plunged deeper into economic crisis."
"The severity of the trade gap reported today by the Commerce Department took the Clinton Administration by surprise. Although the dollar fell to a record low of 89 Japanese yen in New York trading, the decline was relatively modest, given the big jump in the deficit."
"WASHINGTON, July 31 — The White House said today that revised projections showed that the Federal budget deficit for the current .fiscal year would now be $160 billion — or $33 billion lower than previously estimated — and that President Clinton’s plan for balancing the budget in 10 years could probably succeed in 9."
"Mr. Clinton pronounced the latest figures good news, and his top aides acknowledged that the revised estimates might help to foster a compromise with the Republicans, who want to balance the budget in seven years with spending cuts that the< Administration contends are unreal-1* istically large.	I “I’m sure somebody will suggest! that,"" the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said of a possible compromise as Mr. Clinton flew aboard Air Force One to the National Governors’ Association meeting in Burlington, VL	*	."
"But the budget director, Alice M.j Rivlin, in a briefing at the White; House, repeated the Administra-! tion’s longstanding view that balanc-| ing the budget by a certain date was less important than balancing it without damaging programs in areas the President considers most important, like education."
"said. Among other points, she noted, the Republicans favor far bigger cuts in growth of Medicare spending than Mr. Clinton has been willing to accept and at the same time they want steep tax cuts. Mr. Panetta attributed the decline in the projected deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to better-than-expected growth in the economy and a spending cut bill signed last week by Mr. Clinton that trimmed $9 billion from current spending."
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 — Household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, the Census Bureau reported today, as the number of poor people in the United States dropped by more than 1.6 million, reaching historic lows for blacks and the elderly."
"The bureau said half the households in the country had incomes of at least $34,074, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. The inflation-adjusted increase of $898 was the first rise in median household income since 1989, the year before the nation’s last recession, and it was the largest increase in household earnings since 1986."
"At the same time, the percentage of the nation’s population that is poor dropped to 13.8, from 14.5 in 1994. It was the second consecutive year of a decline in the poverty rate."
"The report said that 29.3 percent of blacks in the United States lived below the poverty line in 1995. For the first time since 1959, when the Census Bureau started keeping such statistics — and probably for the first time in the nation’s history — the poverty rate for African-Americans dipped below 30 percent."
"Also for the first time, the poverty rate for the nation’s elderly last year dropped below that of working-age people, making those 65 years of age and older the group with the lowest percentage of poor people."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 — By almost any statistical measure, the reduction in the Federal budget deficit, hailed by President Clinton today, is impressive: it has dropped to its lowest level in 15 years, so low that the United States now has the smallest deficit — as a percentage of its economy — of any of the world’s largest industrialized nations."
"The most popular theory is that investors, convinced that they have ridden the stock market surge as far as they dare, are beginning to reap their profits, which funnels capital gains tax revenue to the Government. Others note that since most of the Increased revenue seems to be coming from individual tax returns and speculate that the swelling of the employment rolls is turning nontax-paying households into taxpayers. But usually people entering the work force for the first time are not paying big tax bills."
Recalling that Ruth W. Messinger had “stuck by me” through his own difficult New York political contest five years ago. President Clinton made a long-sought trip to Manhattan last night and vigorously urged voters to support her mayoral bid. He asserted that she had grasped the main issues confronting the city now that crime was in decline: failing schools and lingering unemployment.
"“I say to you, I believe if 1 were mayor of New York City,” Mr. Clinton said, “I would say my three priorities are: I’m going to get the unemployment rates down to the national level. I’m going to fix our schools and I’m going to give these kids something to do after school to keep them out of trouble.”"
"Mr. Clinton’s proposal came after a week of turmoil in world financial markets and growing fears that ilj'e l.M.F.’s severe shortage of moneyis paralyzing its ability to calm investors, who are pulling billions of dol; lars out of emerging-market court* tries."
"The move is motivated, Mr. Cltifi ton said, by mounting evidence thitt the financial turmoil is threatening the United States."
"At the White House, the President’s chief economic adviser, Janet L. Yellen, exulted in the latest set of figures, which represented a nearperfect combination of decent growth and stable prices."
"“Unemployment hovers in a dec-ades-low range, jobs are being created at a robust pace and there are still no signs of inflationary pressures,” Ms. Yellen said in a statement."
"All figures are seasonally adjusted except discouraged workers. 'Hispanic people can be of any race. fPeople not working but not counted as unemployed because they have become too discouraged to look: must have searched in the past 12 months and been available for work when surveyed ture was the fact that the ranks of the unemployed grew by 302,000, •more than offsetting May’s improvement. Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, though, the job market remains in healthy shape, analysts said. And after hitting a 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May, a modest rise in unemployment could provide some breathing room to let the economy, now in its seventh year of uninterrupted growth, expand for a longer period without a recession."
"Stocks had fallen sharply on Friday, and some investors were worried that if the Dow fell another 15 points, to 10 percent below the record it set on March 11, the bull market might be in serious jeopardy."
"Yesterday’s gain was bolstered by strong corporate earnings reports and by bargain hunters. ""It was time for the blue chips to come back,” said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential Securities, though the market remains sensitive to any bad news."
"That view held that Asia’s problems were relatively unimportant to this country’s economy, and that the United States’ financial markets would benefit as a rush of money from abroad sought safety, driving American stock and bond prices higher. In addition, it was hoped by many on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve would be sufficiently alarmed about Asia that it would push interest rates lower."
"In fact, the Asian woes have begun to hurt the profits of many companies, both those that sell to Asian customers and those that compete with Asian companies whose sinking currencies have made price reductions possible. Poor profit reports, combined with Mr. Greenspan’s comments, seem to explain the falling share prices."
"There was a funny political cartoon recently, spoofing the fact that nothing President Clinton does seems to affect his poll ratings — as long as the stock market keeps rising. The cartoon showed a newscaster announcing that a severed head fid'd been found in Mr. Clinton’s sleeping quarters in the White House, but with the Dow having reached a new record high the U.S. public was indifferent."
"How long, oh Lord, how long can the U.S. keep thriving while everyone elSe is in turmoil? Is America now on another planet or what? I posed that question to Goldman, Sachs’ re-nov/ned market analyst Abby Joseph Cohen. Her answer: It can last longer than you might think."
"Ms. Cohen argues that the U.S. economy is a lot like a supertanker — not the prettiest of ships, not the fastest, but once it got on the right course, once the U.S. Government ild leading corporations went through the necessary deregulation and streamlining to get ready for this era of rapid technological change and global markets, “this U.S. supertanker is not easily set off course, and it s the sort of ship you want to be on when the seas get rough.”"
"Sure, the U.S. must care about what happens abroad, says Ms. Cohen, After all, America is the world’s largest importer and exporter. But the.U.S. economy is so big that foreign trade is still only 13 percent of overall U.S. economic activity, which remains “quite robust,” notes Ms. Cohen. Moreover, U.S. foreign trade is divided pretty evenly among Western Europe, Asia and North and South America. So while Asia’s on its back. Canada, Latin America and many Western European countries are getting stronger."
"For the last three years investors have been sleepwalking their way to riches in the stock market. Putting money into a stock index fund — a one-decision move — has proved not only the best way to avoid underperforming the averages, but also the path to outsized profits. The Vanguard Group’s fund that mirrors the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has almost doubled since the end of 1934."
"But the heyday of this particular investment strategy may have ended on Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 300 points. Even though the major market averages rebounded ever so slightly yesterday, the sharp drop on Tuesday, coming on top of recent weakness, belied what might be the beginning of a big shift in investor psychology."
"Renewed fears that Asia’s economic crisis will stall growth in the profits of American companies sent United States’ stocks plunging yesterday, the worst in a string of recent selloffs that has now erased the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones industrial average."
"Since crossing the 9,000 mark in April — a level almost 1,100 points above where the blue-chip average began the year — the Dow has faced trouble sustaining that height."
"The barometer of the nation’s top industrial companies fell 207.01 points yesterday, to 8,627.93, a 2.3 percent drop that left it down 6.3 percent from its record high. Some other market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting that a stock market correction — a drop of 10 percent or more — is under way."
"The selloff erased the last of the market’s gains this year and sent stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak set just £ix weeks ago, the sharpest decline Jin eight years.	>,"
The frenzied selling dashed the hopes of investors who had expected the market’s recent slump — whifch began with worries over econonjic conditions in Asia and accelerated as financial troubles ensnared Russia — to be stayed by the fundamental strength of the American economy.
"The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, lo 7,539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below where it started the year. The decline was the second largest in the Dow’s history in point terms, trailing the 554-point drop last Oct. 27, but it did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percentage terms. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the market, fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to 957.28, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998. The declines were the greatest among technology stocks, which until recently had been the market leaders."
"The cumulative effect of the last few weeks is nearly as great as the one-day market plunge on Oct. 19, 1987, when stock prices fell 22.6 percent. But a market rebound soon followed and the national economy did not stray into recession."
"While there were few signs yesterday of panic among individual- investors, market participants said that selling by mutual fund companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors that began over the weekend, played a part in th? decline, including the stampede that sent the Dow average down 250 points in the last half-hour of trading."
"The economy grew at a surprisingly strong pace this winter, and inflation remained unexpectedly subdued, the Government reported yesterday."
"Instead of slowing down as the Asian recession hit American manufacturers, the economy picked up speed, growing at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. And instead of drifting higher as Washington and Wall Street feared, the broadest measure of Inflation dipped below 1 percent to its lowest rate since 1964."
"“We keep expecting a slowdown and it never comes,” said Jeffrey A. Frankel of the Council of Economic Advisers. ""We’re returning to the economy of the 50’s and 60's — a remarkable, remarkable combination of strong growth without inflation.”"
"Investors had been worrying that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise interest rates, a concern that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting more than 140 points on Monday. Yesterday, they decided to focus on the good news on Inflation, which touched off rallies in the stock and bond markets, with the Dow climbing 111.85 points, to 9,063.37."
"WASHINGTON, June 29 (Bloomberg News) — Sales of new homes rose in May to a record level, fueled by low interest rates and high consumer optimism."
"New single-family home 7 * sales rose three-tenths of a percent in May, to an annual rate of 890,000 units, the Commerce Department said today, breaking the previous record set"" in April. Analysts had expected a drop in May sales to an annual rate of 877,000 units."
"“It’s so good that it’s scary,” said Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive at the luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. “We’re enjoying a fabulous market and I would expect it’s going to continue as long as the economy is supportive.” The housing strength has been defined by the longest stretch ever of new-home sales exceeding an 800.000-	unit annual pace. May marked the ninth consecutive month the pace of sales was above that level. Sales of new ! one-family homes in the first quarter averaged 855,000 a month at an annual rate, a record and up 3.3 percent from the 828,000 average a month in the fourth quarter. New-home sales rose 15.7 percent in the West, to a 265,000 rate, in the Northeast new-home sales rose 3.3 percent, to a 94,000 rate, the highest since a similar pace in March 1997.

"The mood was decidedly downbeat in the United States. The International Monetary Fund's annual meeting ended in Washington without agreement from the ministers in attendance on a plan to resolve the crisis. [Page A6.] And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve’s once upbeat chairman, said the likelihood of continued good times in America had “weakened measurably.” [Page Cl.|"
"His blunt statement was taken as a hint that the Fed would again lower interest rates, and the Dow Jones industrial average, perhaps in response, recovered from a 100-point fall to finish almost unchanged. But Nasdaq tumbled to 15-month low."
"One implication of that rising deficit is that a steady increase in competitively priced imports can, over time, lead to an erosion of American market share and jobs."
"As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains over the last three years, some investors may have thought to wonder, on occasion and in an idle sort of way, just what a"
"Yesterday was different in another way, however. It marked the first time in years that the three most popular market indexes — the Dow Jones, the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — actually lost ground for the year. Until now, the declines in the indexes."
"No longer. Investors, playing with the house’s money all year, are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own. Even those who own index funds, which had registered gains until yesterday, are now eating into last year’s gains."
"There was no stopping the selling. No “circuit breakers” to stop trading on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares. Under the new rules instituted by the exchange last October, it would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 — The Congressional Budget Office projected today that the Federal budget deficit would be all but eliminated this year, continuing a deluge of good fiscal news that has both political parties . eager to begin dividing the spoils."
"' The budget office said the deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 would be just $5 billion, down from . $22.7 billion last year and so small in 1 a $1.7 trillion budget as to be almost meaningless. t Its analysis showed even smaller ^deficits for the next two years, and"
"The $5 billion figure for this year was far more specific than President Clinton’s announcement on Monday that White House budget analysts expect the 1998 deficit to decline to below $22 billion, and it is the latest evidence of how jhe strong economy is propelling Washington into an era of fiscal plenty far faster than almost anyone anticipated. As recently as last September, the budget office was predicting a $57 billion deficit for this year."
"leadership agreed on a plan last summer to balance the budget by 2002. The President said on Monday that he now expected to balance the budget next year, three years ahead of schedule."
"But the budget office’s projections, which in recent years have proven considerably too pessimistic, confirmed the predictions of many private analysts that the deficit could be wiped out this year, well before most of the spending cuts called for by the budget deal take effect."
The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are beginning to unnerve the nation’s more affluent families and make them more cautious in their spending.
"The consumers in question are people like Ellen Elias, a partner in an upscale Manhattan appliance store, Elgot, at 937 Lexington Avenue, a woman in her forties who says she “owns enough stock to be concerned.” She is hoping that stock prices will rebound by the time she needs the money, closer to her retirement. Since mid-July, when the sell-off began, American stocks have lost $1.5 trillion of their value, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, estimated last week. If this decline continues, Ms. Elias said, she may have second thoughts about some of her spending."
"Markets surged after the Government released a report that showed a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns about inflation. The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April blunted the effect of a surge in energy prices. The increase was below analysts’ forecasts and when the volatile food and energy components were excluded, prices were unchanged."
The July figures seemed to rule out any need for the Federal Reserve to increase a key lending rate by more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"The stock and bond markets surged yesterday after the Government released a reassuring report that showed a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns about inflation."
"The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April blunted the Impact of a surge in energy prices. The July increase, which followed a decline of one-tenth of a percent in June, was below analysts’ forecasts. When the volatile food and energy components were excluded, prices were unchanged."
"The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 184.26 points, its biggest rise since mid-June, as interest rates fell as much as one-tenth of a percentage point."
"Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman, yesterday served notice that he does not want to spoil the fun. While the Fed did raise an important interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, as had been widely expected, it also said its policy was now neutral, rather than biased in favor of a further increase. Wall Street celebrated by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 200 points in the first 15 minutes after the Fed announcement. Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues seem to be betting that the economy will cool down without much action by the central bank."
"The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 11,299.76, up 199.15 points, or 1.79 percent. The average has risen 23 percent so far this year, well above its 16 percent gain during all of 1998. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index also rose 1.77 percent Monday, but remains 4.1 percent below its high reached on July 16."
"The turnabout in investor mood comes after weeks of directionless and confused stock trading. Having peaked in mid-July, most of the market indexes fell as investors grew concerned that rising commodity prices and labor costs as well as strong economic growth around the world would push the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rates. A slight weakening in the dollar, which could push up prices of imported goods and make United States stocks less attractive abroad, was also a worry."
"Certainly it is good news ^ that the benefits of a vigorous economy have started to trickle J down toward young r black men in the inner cities. According to a recent study by the economists Richard Freeman and William Rodgers, even black males ages 16 to 24 are working more often, earning better wages and committing fewer crimes than was the case during the recession of the early 1990’s."
"But before concluding that a booming economy has succeeded where government job training and affirmative action programs have failed, we should recall some elementary facts of economic history."
There is good reason to think that a similar reversal will happen again once the current expansion ends.
"“We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services” when making decisions about interest rates, Mr."
"The stock market, in response to Mr. Greenspan’s remarks, which were delivered at an annual conference on monetary policy issues organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, fell moderately today. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 108.28 points, or near-' ly 1 percent, closing at 11,090.17 in light trading. [Page C3.J"
"Relying on the surplus reduces the sacrifices that would be necessary from today’s workers and tomorrow’s retirees, and for that reason Republicans, too, have generally endorsed allocating a big portion of the surplus to Social Security."
"Mr. Clinton has alluded in general terms to the need for measures in addition to using the surplus, but has avoided specifics, while Republicans have been silent or called for solutions that require neither tax increases nor benefit cuts."
"the White House’s Social Security proposal, saying that its call for the Government to invest $700 billion in the stock market would result in political meddling in the free enterprise system. But Mr. Greenspan was supportive again today of Mr. Clinton’s call for a large portion of the surplus to be used to bolster Social Security by paying down the national debt."
"These are astounding economic times. Overseas, Europe is slowing, most of Asia is in recession $nd Brazil threatens to drag down much of South America. But in the United States, consumers are spending with abandon and economists continue to toe surprised by how robust the economy is."
"It was against that background that Alan 'Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. He again predicted that the economy would slow this year, and again warned that stock prices appeared to be overvalued."
"More than any other factor, the long decline in the value of the dollar appears to have pushed up the inflation rate in recent months."
"In the absence of cheaper foreign products, the manufacturers of many basic materials, like chemicals, plastics, paper, steel, copper and liner-board, have managed to impose hefty price increases that feed inflation."
"“The weak dollar is finally showing up as an inflation factor,” said John D. Paulus, chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Company."
"Unusually Strong Jump Such increases, some of them more than 20 percent last year, are a major reason why the national inflation rate is higher today than it was last summer. Inflation took an unusually strong jump in January, raising an alarm that it might be getting out of hand. In response, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates up noticeably last week, hoping to discourage the borrowing and constant buying that help generate inflation."
"President Bush’s plan to resolve the financial troubles of the nation’s savings industry is based on assumptions that interest rates will decline sharply and deposits increase steadily in coming years, according to figures made available yesterday by the Office of Management and Budget."
"The projections were immediately criticized by some private analysts, who said the figures were based on an overly optimistic view of the economy, interest rales and inflation over the next 10 years. They said the plan underestimated the true cost of the rescue by many billions of dollars."
"“The interest-rate projections are wildly optimistic,"" said Bert Ely, a consultant in Alexandria, Va."
The new figures added to the debate that has surrounded the rescue plan since it was announced two weeks ago.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 - In an unusually direct statement, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the nation’s inflation rate was unacceptably high and that he would seek to reduce it."
Mr. Greenspan’s remarks raised the possibility that short-term interest rates might be pushed higher.
"""Our strategy continues to be centered on moving toward, and ultimately reaching, stable prices — that is, price levels sufficiently stable so that expectations of change do not become major factors in key economic decisions,” Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee. “Current inflation rates, by that criterion, clearly are too high and must be brought down.”"

"Your advocacy of motor fuel price increases to raise revenue and reduce the Federal deficit (editorial, Dec. 12) reflects a widespread misunderstanding that has too long characterized pricing policy for public services: the stale is somehow expected to provide all the highway infrastructure and allow use without reference to imposed cost."
"Sales taxes on road-related products are merely indirect taxes, like those on clothing or chocolates, and when there is a need for more revenue to reduce the inflationary impact of large deficits, sales taxes provide a ready source. The “nickel tax"" increase passed in 1984 was the most recent example of such thinking. Like most other road-sector fees and taxes throughout North America, it failed to come to grips with the challenge of economic efficiency, which requires that, since trucks do damage that varies exponentially with their weight, the prices they should pay to"
"CHICAGO Aug. I — If one thing was clear at the close of the 81st annual meeting of the National Governors’ Association today, it was that the Federal budget deficit will place a growing burden on the states and make innovation far more difficult."

"In the first eight months of the 1989 fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, the budget deficit shrank to $113.32 billion, from $128.43 billion in the comparable period a year ago, the department said."
"The Bush Administration has projected a rise in the deficit to $163.3 billion for the 1989 fiscal year, from"
Prices spurted across the maturity spectrum immediately after release yesterday morning of a smaller-than-anticipaled March trade deficit.
"Specifically, the 7.4 percent increase in exports, to a record $30.78 billion, showed continued strength in the manufacturing sector."
"The figures suggest that upcoming revisions to economic growth statistics for the first quarter will not be pushed downward, a move some economists had said might occur if the trade report was not particularly strong. In addition, the strong export growth diminishes the possibility that the Federal Reserve Board might move soon to ease credit conditions."
"The export figures, coupled with a report from the nation's purchasing managers earlier this month suggesting that export growth was vibrant in April, suggest that an important component of the economy remains vigorous. The Fed is not likely to ease policy as long as the manufacturing sector remains strong."
"Prices of Treasury notes and bonds slipped in light trading yesterday, as dealers sold securities after a report from regional Federal Reserve banks showed that the economy remained a bit stronger than anticipated."
"While the report, which is referred to as the ‘‘beige book” or ‘‘tan book,” was cited as the main source of selling pressure, some participants said the activity had the scent of a shift in sentiment."
"“The specific excuse you will hear is that the tan book didn’t show enough evidence to let the Fed ease policy,” one Government-bond trader said. ""But the market is trading very poorly. Dealer positions are larger than the pace of business."
"In addition to the beige book, which said the economy was ""stable to modestly expanding"" in November, market participants reacted to comments from an unidentified senior Federal Reserve official that appeared on the Market News Service."
"The lower trade balance signals that the United States is becoming more competitive. Administration officials and many economists hailed the report as an indication, in particular, that improvement has been achieved despite the run-up in the dollar since the beginning of the year."
"The September figure of $10.5 billion, an improvement of $1.8 billion from August, reflected both higher exports and lower imports. Page Dl."
"WASHINGTON. Nov. 16 — The United States trade deficit shrank to $10.5 billion in September, a double-barreled $1.8 billion improvement that reflected both higher exports and lower imports."
"While today’s Commerce Department report was well within the expectations of most experts, the new data and other economic figures tended to confirm recent indications that the economy has probably not slowed to any significant degree."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — The Treasury said today that Taiwan and South Korea were manipulating their currencies to stimulate sales of their goods to the United States, thereby impeding a reduction of the big American trade deficit."
"In a report to Congress on international economic policy, the Treasury also sought to rebuff those economists and international authorities who maintain that the dollar should fall still further. The dollar has fallen about 40 percent since February 1985, when it reached its peak against other major currencies. The dollar’s decline was intended to help narrow the trade deficit, which reached a record $170 billion last year."
"The impact will soon be felt by small businesses, which remain heavily dependent on banks for loans, and by consumers, whose payments on home-equity loans and variable-rate credit cards will rise. Although the higher prime rate could affect consumer spending slightly, it is unlikely to be a major drag on the economy."
"One Day After Testimony The rise in the prime rate came one day after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, indicated to the Senate Banking Committee that he would be prepared to raise interest rates further if inflationary pressures worsen. His remarks, however, implied that he saw no reason to do so now."
"TORONTO, June 19 — Officials of the leading industrial countries sought here today to dispel speculation about a coordinated move toward a substantial increase in world interest rates because of signs of rising inflation."
"This time, however, the official said, American rates have risen a bit this year, while German rates have not risen as much. “But nobody’s saying a tightening of money is going on,” the official added."
Suspicion of a rise in rates coordinated by the leaders of the seven nations attending the economic summit conference has arisen in recent days in world financial markets.
"WASHINGTON, June 14 — In a report that was far better than expected for the second straight month, the Government said today that the nation’s trade deficit shrank 15.5 percent in April, to the lowest monthly point in more than two and a half years."
"Imports, which had remained at stubbornly high levels while their prices in dollars rose, fell sharply in April. Exports slowed only slightly from their recent torrid pace."
"The $9.9 billion trade deficit in April was the smallest since August 1985, when the figure was also $9.9 billion. No monthly level has been lower since the $8 billion of December 1984."
"The April trade deficit was at least $2 billion less than most predictions, and the report set off major rallies in the bond and stock markets and lifted the dollar's value. The latest Commerce Department data seemed, among other things, to make it more likely that inflation could be contained without having to use strong countermeasures involving higher interest rates."
"“It’s a shocker,” said Daniel Friel, an economist, of the trade report. As a result, he sees “very little pressure fori the Federal Reserve to tighten"" because the booming export-oriented manufacturing sector may be getting “some respite” and American consumers seem to be curbing their own demand for goods. Mr. Friel is with the NCNB Corporation, a major bank holding company in the Southeast."
"According to the report, inflation picked up to a 4.7 percent rate during the spring, from 3.5 percent in the first quarter, as measured by the gross national product fixed-weighted price index."
"The report prompted fresh conjecture as to whether the Fed might decide to take yet another step in the series of small ones it has taken this year to raise interest rates, thereby slowing the economy."
"Erratic monthly trade figures make it impossible to read a trend until well after it starts. In monthly reports, the deficit peaked last November, shrank for two months, grew in February and shrank in March. But the reports were raw and incomplete. Only now does the Commerce Department’s quarterly report confirm substantial improvement in the first three months of this year."
"Inflation fears heightened last Friday when the Government reported that producer prices rose in March by six-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since last spring. What happens to prices at the producer level tends to show up in consumer prices several months later."
"The decision is unlikely to have much immediate market impact because it largely ratified the status quo, and because the economic importance of the gray market has declined as the dollar’s value has fallen. Gray market imports are profitable only when foreign businesses sell their products overseas for much less than they sell them in the United States."
"Senator Albert Gore Jr. defines his positions on arms negotiations, the budget deficit and other issues in an interview conducted in advance of the New York State primary election."
"WASHINGTON, April 14 — In a major surprise, the nation’s trade deficit grew sharply to $13.8 billion in February, as imports surged more than, twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported today."
"Most economists and participants in the financial markets had expected some improvement, and word of the $1.4 billion widening of the trade gap caused the dollar to plunge and forced world central banks to intervene to restore stability. Bond and stock prices tumbled along a broad front as the dol-( lar declined."
"The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down by 101.46 points, or 4.8 percent. The dramatic fall of stock prices, mainly in the afternoon, reduced the drop in bond prices by half, as many investors sold stocks and switched to more secure fixed-income investments."
"He could start by examining the new “Economic Report of the President,” his very own, beginning on page 32. It asserts that excessively tight monetary policy last year slowed growth, raised interest rates unnecessarily and helped bring down the stock market. The President might also request a copy of a January letter from Michael Darby, Treasury’s chief economist, to each member of the Fed’s Open Market Committee — the system’s policy-making council — arguing for loosening up now."
"In “A New Warning on the Trade Deficit” (editorial, Dec. 11), you sound the alarm over the trade deficit. Financial writers like Leonard Silk (Economic Scene column, Business Day, Dec. 11) warn that in a few years our total indebtedness to foreigners could approach $1 trillion if the trade imbalance continues."
Quite rightly you state that the experts aren’t sure how to fix it. To this conclusion we should add that under our current administration of trade policy there is very little likelihood the situation will improve.
"The stock market lurched downward yesterday as a return of volatile trading ended a fragile, five-day rally."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply from the onset and was down as much as 115 points around 1
"P.M. It later recovered about half its loss, closing the day down 50.56 points, at 1,963.53, a decline of 2.51 percent."
"The tumble was set off in part, market analysts said, by nervous investors who bought in at low prices in the last week and were eager to take profits after the recent rally. A lack of progress in the negotiations in Washington on reducing the Federal budget deficit convinced these investors that the market upswing could not be sustained, the analysts said."
"WASHINGTON, July 2 — The nation’s unemployment rate declined two-tenths of- a percentage point to 6 percent in June, the Labor Department reported today."
"Although the rate has not been so low since late 1979, and in fact had been widely expected to show a slight increase, Government and private analysts agreed that the latest labor market data were considerably weaker than the - unemployment rate itself would suggest."
"The number of Americans with jobs actually declined 198,000, as measured by the department’s survey of households, and for the second straight month business payrolls showed only a lackluster increase."
"“It sort of puts into doubt the strength of the economy at this point,"" commented Maria F. Ramirez, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert."
"EXECUTIVE stock options, like other investment devices tied to the stock market, have been hurt by the October market plunge and accompanying financial turmoil. In fact, the price at which many of these options can be exercised is now much higher than the market price — which is known as being “under water.”"
"Because the exercise price is likely to remain higher for some time, compensation specialists report that companies — many of which are setting up option plans for 1988 — are considering the issuance of new options at lower prices."
"“Unquestionably the vast majority of companies will cancel the outstanding options and issue new ones at lower prices,” said Robert Salmen, a principal and head of executive compansation research at William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm. “We received the first inquiry on this on the Tuesday after the market crash.”"
"! Wall Street, shaken by the turmoil in the stock market, is slamming the brakes on what had been the greatest boom in American financial history. After a decade of unprecedented growth, fueled by a huge flow of profits, a new word is working its way into the financial lexicon: contraction."
"A strangely exuberant, magical era of soaring bonuses, bull markets, an endless flow of billion-dollar deals, multimillion-dollar fees and wholesale migrations from the nation's best business schools to securities houses appears to be coming to a close."
"J.	Lilt, a former securities industry consultant and now the chief financial officer of E. F. Hutton & Company, which announced on Friday that it was laying off 40 people in its municipal bond department. “This is real downsizing. The word for it industrywide really is contraction.”"
"There had even been some layoffs before Black Monday, Oct. 19, as some firms sought to trim their bloated ranks after doubling or even tripling in size over the last five years. The market collapse rattled managers who were unprepared to deal with such huge numbers of people in hard times."
"The Dow Jones industrial average, which has been marching up since August 1982, began a dramatic fall last week that continued through yesterday when it closed at 1,738.74. Shown: Weekly close of the Dow.'	Vi;v y \	yy"
"But today’s economy is better equipped to handle financial shocks. “I don’t see this decline in the stock market leading to a great breakdown in the economy,” said Robert A. Kavesh, a professor of finance and economics at the New York University School of Business. “There are still many elements of strength in the economy — profits are strong, for example.” Among the important differences between today and 1929 are Federal deposit insurance, unemployment insurance and Social Security insurance and other elements of what has come to be known as the safety net. These not only guarantee against widespread destitution; their very existence should also help to prevent the kind of financial panic that fed on itself in the Depression."
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 — The stock market collapse forced the impossible: a summit meeting between the White House and Congress on a deficit-reducing package."
"The talks are floundering because the White House and Congressional negotiators remain deeply divided over the same tax issues and military and domestic spending priorities they have fought over since 1981, and because pressure from constituents on the issue has been minimal."
"RUSSELL, Kan., Nov. 9 — Calling himself a candidate of America's heartland, Senator Bob Dole returned to his prairie hometown today to formally announce that he is a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination. He put erasing the budget deficit at the heart of his Presidency."
At the same time Mr. Dole pledged to “tackle the runaway Federal budget head-on” through cuts in Federal spending except for those programs that “assist vulnerable Americans.” He vowed not to raise tax rates and said his fundamental goal was a balanced budget.
"NEWARK, July 10 — For 12 years, Nona Payton worked as a claims clerk in unemployment offices. Soon, she will return — as a client."
"Other workers have seen their salaries cut by as much as $10,000 a year because their positions were taken over by employees with higher Civil Service classifications who lost their positions through reorganization."
Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that it had lost $250 million this month because bonds that it owned plummeted in value when interest rates surged.
I Wall Street executives could not re-[ call an occasion when a securities firm lost so much in so short a time — ap-I parently little more than a week.
"j In the last few weeks the bond markets have been particularly turbulent, and one sector, municipal bonds, took its worst drubbing in years. The individual investors who dominate the tax-exempt market suffered losses of about 10percent. |Page Dl.]"
"Merrill’s losses came from $1.7 billion in transactions involving complex and volatile mortgage-backed bonds, according to officials at the firm and other Wall Street sources. Those trans-| actions went awry when those bonds tumbled in value."
"J.	Bennett has led the charge, accusing colleges of being greedy in pushing up tuitions at rates that reach double digits in some cases, and that far exceed increases for food, automobiles and other goods and services. At some top private schools, costs for 1987-88 will approach $18,000 per student."
"Stung by the accusations of • greed and inefficiency, the colleges and universities are striking back, arguing that, in an industry in which greater efficiency cannot be equated with personnel cutbacks, some of their costs necessarily go up faster than inflation."
"The Republic National Bank in New York at 4 P.M. quoted gold bullion at $447.00 an ounce, down $5.50 from Monday’s late bid."
Stock prices sulrged and interest rates tumbled yesterday as investors became increasingly optimistic that inflation has been checked.
"Stocks rose to record levels, with the the Dow Jones industrial average closing above 1,700 for the first time. It rose 17.09 points, to 1,713.99, in what was the fifth-busiest session in New York Stock Exchange history. The average moved past 1,600 as recently as Feb. 6."
"In the same three weeks, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have fallen by a percentage point, to 8.29 percent, a remarkably sudden drop for the benchmark issue. Bond prices have risen 11 points during the three weeks, or $110 per $1,000 bond."
"finally setting aside their memories of 1979 and 1980, when inflation exceeded 10 percent and the bond markets were a disaster zone. Inflation causes havoc in the bond markets as investors demand higher interest rates to protect the value of their securities. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. With yesterday’s decline in rates, bond prices soared."
"Interest rates stayed high in recent years because of investor nervousness that inflation might be rekindled. But now, after four years of inflation at 4 percent or less, and with important drops in oil prices pointing to a rate of 3 percent or less this year, investors are buying bonds with yields that would have been unthinkable just months ago."
"The reduction, the third this year, brought the crucial discount rate to its lowest level since the start of 1978."
"The discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges on loans it makes to financial institutions, normally leads to widespread declines of interest rates charged businesses and consumers. The declines, in turn, tend to enliven the economy by encouraging individuals and corporations to borrow more and spend more."
"Earlier this year the Federal Reserve reduced the discount rate twice to stimulate the economy. On March 7 the rate was cut to 7 percent from 7>4 percent. Six weeks later, on April 18, the rate was cut to 6*4 percent."
"Commenting on the national figures, Larry M. Speakes, the White House spokesman, said “the continuing good economic news will add considerably to real consumer purchasing power.’’ “There will be more money in Americans’ pockets,” he added, ’to buy more goods and services at lower prices.”"
"America’s foreign trade deficit roars on at a record clip. Domestic growth has slowed and pressure mounts for unilateral protection against imports. The Reagan Administration, floundering in a mess of its own making, pleads for patience at home while it tries to force other governments to sell less to us and buy more from us. Getting into this jam was easy. Getting out won’t be."
"To support his case against the rigidity of quotas, White House negotiators have meanwhile scurried to show that they can fend off disruptive imports without new legislation. In the last seven days, they have completed renegotiation of the expiring 54-nation pact that controls textile trade, struck a separate new textile deal with South Africa, and concluded an agreement with Japan on computer chips."
"Textiles and chips are important but they are just part of the trade problem. Total imports exceeded exports by a record $14$ billion last year. The 1986 gap will almost surely be larger. To the Administration’s chagrin, the Commerce Department has just reported the June deficit, $14.2 billion, changed little from May."
"lar soared until it started down again a year ago. The Administration shrugged off the high value of the dollar, claiming that it just showed America’s “strength.” But that “strong” dollar pushed American goods out of foreign markets, brought more foreign goods into American markets, wiped out factory jobs and devastated farmers. Now that the dollar’s value has dropped, imports should drop and exports strengthen. But there’s a long lag because of goods already in the pipeline at the old prices. Some business, in any case, is gone forever."
The recent sharp decline owes much to cut-rate financing offered by Detroit on new cars. The borrowing to pay for them severely affected the personal savings rate.
"But even if the plunge turns out to be an aberration, it would provide little comfort to many economists, because they view the longer-term savings rate as insufficient, too. What concerns them is the suspicion that what is holding American savings at levels well below those of many other countries are changes in both the profile of the population and the overall economy."
Interest rates on Treasury securities rose yesterday for the fourth consecutive trading day as securities dealers vainly tried to attract buyers for the large amount of notes and bonds they hold in inventory.
The reluctance of many investors to purchase recently offered Treasury securities — particularly longterm issues due In 10 years and more — is widely attributed to fears that the Federal Reserve will begin to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates by spring.
"Despite statements Wednesday by Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that monetary policy was not being tightened, many investors are willing to stay on the sidelines because they expect interest rates to rise and bond prices to fall later in the year."
"“Volcker must have known about the stronger G.N.P. numbers and money supply rise on Wednesday when he said that monetary policy was not being tightened,” one government securities dealer said. “The concern in the market is not with what the Fed is doing today or tomorrow but what will the Fed be doing several weeks from now.”"
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 — Reflecting a surge in imports of cars, clothing, steel and other manufactured goods, the United States trade deficit grew to a record $15.5 billion in September, the Commerce Department said today."
"The trade deficit, which narrowed in July and August, widened in September despite a 17 percent depreciation of the dollar since February."
"With a slight shift to the easier side, the composite rate showed a reduction of 0.45 point in contrast to the sharp gain in the preceding session. Active market observers called it a technical reaction; those with a more realistic approach branded it one born of extreme caution."
"Trading in the motors accounted for an increase in business on the Stock Exchange where transfers reached 2,480,000 shares, against 2,200,000 shares on Monday. And, of the 1,178 issues dealt, 468 declined while 419 showed grains."
"Chrysler still drew some support from the persistent rumors in Wall Street of a stock split and the ‘ rumor mongers"". in the downtown section provided added fuel to the automotive division, as General Motors topped the market in volume on 51,400 shares and with a slight advantage of % point at 50. Whereas Packard slipped % point to a rate of 4, Chrysler made a new gain of a point to end at 79."
"For tne nrteentn consecutive month the case load rose-, Mr. Hilliard noted. The latest upturn was from 136,440 cases in January to 169,645 in February. A total of 345,708 persons received public assistance last month, an increase of 9,087 over January."
"Commissioner Hilliard said that the increased case load was a result of unemployment that continued high and that was reflected in a rate of almost 3,500 applications weekly."
"A large army of unemployed, he said, constitutes “a reservoir from which new applicants are continuously flowing."" Each week sees more persons exhausting first their unemployment insurance and then their savings, after which they turn to the Welfare Department for support, the Commissioner explained."
"F. Raymond Peterson, retiring president of the association, in a press interview at the hotel during the afternoon, termed the conflict between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury ""unfortunate."" The Federal Reserve, which favors higher rates as an anti-inf . ary influence, recently acted to increase the rediscount rate to l‘ t per cent, while the Treasury insisted on refunding its maturing obligations at l'i per cent."
"The market managed to regain some of its poise shortly thereafter only to be hit by another flurry of sales in the closing period. At the close, losses ranged from 1 to 5 points in the extreme with the comp6site rate reduced by 1.27 points. In effect, the share list was only a point above the low set on June 30."
Televisions were the hardest hit in terms of price reductions—probably on the theory that any order for a shift to war-time blue-print for industry would limit an opportunity for increasing profits. The pattern was not uniform nor in adherence to what might develop for various industries in the case of all-out war mobilization.
"A smattering of individual stocks managed to show some gains in excess of a point but losses of fractions generally ruled, with the composite rate down 0.04 point. Business continued to shrink from the high levels of recent weeks, with transfers of 2,340,000 shares on the Stock Exchange, compared with"
"The rails were affected by the spreading of the railroad strike which threatened to cripple transportation in key sections of the country, although some units continued to advance in response to favorable corporate developments such as earnings, stock split proposals and dividend increases. Major commodity markets remained closed and served as an added reason for unrest in the share list. Taxes, however, loomed as the most important problem ahead for market consideration."

"WASHINGTON', June 19—The Wage Stabilization Board ap* proved productivity increases of four cents an hour for a large number of white-collar salaried employes today. A productivity increase is one given for a rise in olant output."
"WASHINGTON, July 2 —No one knows at this juncture what kind of anti-inflation controls will be voted by Congress, to take effect after the extension to Aug. 1 of present regulations -has expired. The millions of unorganized citizens who are principally consumers, meaning they have nothing to sell but their services, may by then have exercised pressure on Congress which will counterbalance that successfully applied thus far by representatives of the meat, textile and commodity interests. Or world events,, including the armistice negotiations in Korea, may have increased the anti-controls trend of Congress beyond the high point reached in the bill passed by the Senate early last Friday morning."
"The possibility that this could be the consequence of any global good news, however clearly temporary its quality, was emphasized by the fact that, before the month’s extension of the old law was granted to the Executive by Congress, the House (the Senate concurring) gave the Administration an extra and stinging rebuff by prohibiting price rollbacks of any kind during the period."
"Like other provisions which fundamentally limit the regulatory powers-of the Executive over the economy, this was the work of one of the Presidents fellow-Democrats, Representative Cooley of North Carolina, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And its consideration at that point was made possible by the House Rules Committee, which Mr. Truman's party colleagues control two to one. Such incidents serve to illuminate an aspect of the battle over controls as striking in its way as the success of the lobbies was in another. This second manifestation was the opposition to major items in the Administration’s anti-inflption program by the Democratic leaders in Congress."
"HARRIMAN, N. Y., May 19-Leaders of a cross-section of American life expressed disagreement today as towether the nation would face inflation or recession before the end of this year."
"The unpredictable turn of international tension and Federal expenditures for rearmament of the United States and her European Allies became the “big if"" in the discussions of eighty representative citizens attending the American Assembly five-day conference on inflation, its causes, consequences and cures."
"The conferees, who assembled yesterday at Arden House, the ninety-six room manor house presented to Columbia University by W. Averell Harriman, divided today into three panels that met in closed sessions to discuss the direction and extent of this country’s fiscal problems and what to do about them."
"Dr. Benjamin H. Beckhart, Professor of Banking at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, chairman of one of the three round tables, disclosed that the meetings were eliciting a wide diversity of opinion among business, agricultural, labor and industrial leaders and representatives of the professions as to the nature of the problem ahead and ways of attempting its solution."
"From individual participants, who preferred to remain anonymous, a composite picture of the divergent opinion was obtained. One school' of thought held that the present softening of wholesale prices would be reversed by the fall of this year and that inflation would ascend into 1953 as a result of increased Government expenditures for war, and domestic developments that would put more money into the hands of more persons and diminish the available supply of consumer goods."
"Most prices, however, are high even by American standards because most of the goods, being in the so-called luxury category, are burdened with the purchase tax, which ranges from 33-1/3 to 100 per cent."
The second consecutive new high for the year was reached yesterday by the stock market in an extension of the creeping advance. Fur-ther demand for the railroad issues was the main prop for the list;
"Gains ranged from fractions to1 more than a point in a variety of stocks with firmness most pronounced, aside from the carriers. In the motors, metis and airlines."
"Measured by The New York Times index, the composite rate advanced 0.79 point but gains in the rails far exceeded the average. The rails and a few special issues accounted for a rise in the volume on the Stock Exchange to 1,180,-000 shares, from 1,140,000 shares on Wednesday. It was the heaviest turnover so far this month. .In-] terest broadened on the advance] to include 1,088 issues. At the close, 485 showed gains, 297 losses and 306 held unchanged."
"Bernard M. Barucli accused the Administration yesterday of .fomenting inflation : through . ""procrastination and inaction"" although Congress passed what'he called a workable controls law within sixty days after the start of the Korean war. .. The financier ""charged that inflation had been ‘legalized” by the Government itself."
"Mr. Baruch said that he was particularly-“shocked” by an-item appearing yesterday in the ship’s newspaper. The article quoted Price Administrator Ellis Amall and Economic Stabilizer., Roger Putnam as saying that'the cost of living was-going up and nothing! could be done about it."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 16—The Consumers Price Index dropped 0.2 per cent in the month from mid-November to mid-December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This latest recession was due principally to a drop of 1 per cent in food prices. The over-all index figure fell to 190.7 from 191.1."
"The Bureau’s ""old series’’ index, which directly affects the wage rates of millions of employes, dropped even more, 0.3 per cent. The figure for this index was 191, down from 191.6."
"Some of the revisions were included in an ""interim adjusted"" index which the Bureau has been publishing for the last two years. This is the index which dropped"
"Back in early April, when the news showed that prospects were increasing for a resumption of full-scale armistice negotiations in Korea, the stock market here went through a pretty bad time. In one trading session alone, that of Monday, April 6, selling became so general that the volume of trading crossed the 3,000,000 mark for the first time since early 1951."
"WASHINGTON, May 29—Retail! sales continued to gain momentum this month and by the end of the third week stood at 7 per cent above the levels prevailing a year ago, the Federal Reserve Board reported today in its monthly summary of business conditions. The improvement was in spite of a leveling off of industrial production noticeable in April and May."
"According to the board, industrial production, which was at 243 on the agency’s index (based on 1935-1939=100) in March, dropped to 242 in April, where it'remained through the early weeks of this month. The April-May level of activity is still 15 per cent above that of May, 1952.."
Organized industry struck yesterday at the principal prop supporting organized labor’s demands for higher wages this year. The National Association of Manufacturers asserted that the ben- efits of increased industrial productivity should be distributed in the form of lower prices for all Americans rather than fatter pay envelopes for workers in unionized industries.
"With the cost of Jiving edging downward for the first time since the start of the Korean war, major unions have been transferring their emphasis from living costs to productivity in calling for a new round of wage increases in 1B53."
"The union contention is that the productive efficiency of the American economy has been going up at an average rate of 2 to 2 Vi per cent each year and that ""the purchasing power of workers must go up at least as fast if they are to buy the goods they make."
"An increase in the nation’s unemployment unless production is $15,000,000,000 higher in 1954 than in 1953, was forecast yesterday by Dr. Gerhard Colm, chief economist of the National Planning Council."
"What the Utah banker urged, according to news summaries of his talk, was ""a reduction of taxes to increase consumer purchasing power, a debt-management program to increase commercial bank holdings of Government securities and continuation of an easy-money policy by the Federal Reserve.” And he is quoted as saying specifically:"
"Mr. Eccles was one of the earliest and most vocal exponents of the compensatory budget. He argued for it, as a matter of fact, when the magnitude of the federal debt was so small, by present standards, that the case for such a fiscal policy was, in the opinion of many persons, dubious. Today, with a federal debt of more than a quarter of a trillion dollars, no one has to be reminded that the manner in which the debt and the budget are managed can have important repercussions on the economy and on the business cycle. Whatever may have t>een said for the compensatory budget theory twenty years ago, events in the form of a world war, a minor war and several years of postwar inflation have given it a sort of fortuitous validity which, whether we like it or not, is at the moment hardly arguable."
"The purpose is to study the •'serious” unemployment situation and demand immediate Government action, the C. I. O. president said."
"[having said of this country, “We are enormously grateful to you because you have averted a seri-j ous business recession.""	;"
"■ “The budget is a major determinant as to whether this country moves, toward' inflation or deflation,” he said. “When we came in, the deficit was $9,500,-000,000 and increasing.. The budget was set for inflation. The budget his been cut in 1952-53 by $10,000,000,000; and the cut on, the planned • .1953-54 budget will be $14,000,000,000."
"Disagreeing with what he termed “the rosy and optimistic | reports released periodically by the Administration,” Mr. Valente declared: “The true facts are that we have more workers out of jobs i today than we had in 1952. We now have five million workers unemployed in this country, and a large number of those five million people are textile workers."

"J Although unemployment usually decreases in March, last month’s increase was interpreted by Government officials as a sraal} one and as a sign that the trend was “leveling off.”"
"Meanwhile, the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Employment Security reported that, for the week ended March 27, new claims for unemployment compensation had declined by 1,000 to a total of 292,700. The decline continued a trend that had started at the beginning of March."
March 1—United Nations economists put forward a warning today that Western Europe might not he able to meet the shock of a deepened recession in the United States.
"Western Europe’s economic health, showed signs of a “hesitant” recovery in 1953, the economists said. But some of the important developments that make for a more robust economy on the Continent are directly tied to conditions in the United States, the economists added."
"The bond market in 1954 should see a continued full supply of tax-exempt state and municipal issues, decline in corporate offerings, and more stable and probably lower interest rates, according to the year-end survey of Halsey, Stuart & Co., Inc., Chicago bond house."
"The survey showed that corporate spending for new plant and equipment in 1953 probably approached a record $28,000,000,000, but that ""from summer on, easing tendencies in some industrial construction and financing became apparent."
"Utility financing, however, could maintain or exceed the volume of recent year's, the bond house said, with electrical utilities projecting expenditures of nearly $4,500,000,000 and the telephone industry still trying to catch up with the public demand for its facilities. Forecasts in the gas utilities field indicate a reduction of about 30 per cent in :1954 expenditures for production land transmission."

"In a collapse ascribed to the illness of President Eisen-| hower, the stock market yesterday suffered its heaviest dollar; lods in history. With most leaders losing 4 to 8 points a share,; and one as much as 33 %, the value of New York Stock Exchange stocks lost approximately $14,000,000,000, half their 1955 gain. The entire loss for the month of October, 1929, was $16,000,000,000."

"The decisions being made right now by business executives will 'have a great deal to do with the duration of the present boom, Mr. Balderston declared, adding: “Unless the quality of this decision making reflects prudent judgment as well as *. reasonably well-founded appraisal of present and future needs, executives will make mistakes for, which they and their workers and investors will pay the penalty. What I am arguing for is that executives should risk, neither too little nor too much. They should be willing to venture, but still guard against too much optimism.’’	I"

"WASHINGTON, May 24— The United States Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent between mid-March and mid-| April, for the second consecu-jtive monthly increase."
The monthly report by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the index in April was 114.9 per cent of the 1947-49 average of 100. This was 0.6 per cent higher than in April last year.
"According to the bureau’s figures, the index for August stood at 116.8 . per cent of the . 1917-49 average, 2 per cent above August a year ao but 0.2 per cent below the 117 record in July this year."

However, shortly after of Labor publicly denounce the World War I, which left us with Federal Reserve, as these two a debt of $27,000,000,000, it officials did last spring, following the board’s action in approving an advance in the rediscount rate, the underlying assumption here, though unstated, is transparently clear."
"MIAMI BEACH, Jan. 27—The leadership of the merged union movement is expected to call this week for a Congressional investigation on inflation causes."
High officials of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations believe that unions are being blamed unjustly for the rising cost of living.
In our preoccupation with the problem of inflation in the United States some of us are prone to forget from time to time that this country is by no means unique in this respect.
"Both the cost of living (or retail price) index and the wholesale price index rose in all countries in 1956: by 1.2 per cent in France, by 1.3 per cent in Germany, by 4.2 per cent in Italy, by 3.2 per cent in the United Kingdom and by 2.9 per cent in the United States. The maximum rise—"
"While the economists of the B. I. S. concede the importance of the consumer price index, their study finds the wholesale price index “more representative."" This index also rose in all countries."
"ALBANY, Oct. 19 (^—Governor Harriman said today that mounting interest rates were curtailing the amount of state loans available for new low-rent public housing developments."
"Governor Harriman said he had been informed by the State Housing Commissioner, Joseph P. McMurray, that the amount available to local housing authorities during the 1958-59 fiscal year would be cut from $64,000,000 to $58,823,000."
"The $5,177,000 cut from fiscal 1958-59 loans represents a loss of 350 apartments a yeir, the Governor said in a statement."
"""If interest rates continue this high or climb even higher in succeeding years,"" Governor Harriman said, “this will be reflected in comparable annual losses in needed, housing for years to come."
"Prof. Sumner Slichter of Harvard, the most vocal exponent among our better known economists of “creeping,” or “chronic,” inflation, shows no evidence of modifying his position on this question in an article he has written for the current issue of the “Harvard Business-Review.”"
"Particularly interesting to us is Professor Slichter’s explanation of why we have been able to experience creeping inflation without drifting into inflation of a more spectacular kind. It is, he tells us, because we have a Federal Preserve System, which has the power to exercise restraint on credit expansion. ""The greatest danger confronting the economy today,” he declares, “is that political pressure will force abandonment of credit restraint. The result would be an acceleration of price increases.”"
"Although the move was largely technical, to bring the discount rate in line with other short-term interest rates, it was another signal of the Federal Reserve’s determination to fight inflation with even tighter money. The move was taken in the face of sharp criticism of the tight money policy by Congressional Democrats."
"On another front, Roger M. Blough, chairman of the United States Steel Corporation, testified that rising prices were not the cause of inflation but the result of it. He appeared before the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee."
"A Federal Reserve spokesman emphasized that the increase had “followed the market,” and thus should not, by itself, lead to further increases in private lending rates."
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 11-Employment in the United States declined and unemployment increased in November by amounts larger than normal."
"The Departments of Commerce and Labor reported today that the volume of unemployment was the largest for a November since 1949, when there was a recession."
"Employment in November was 64,873,000, off 1,132,000 from October and approximately 400,000 lower than in November, 1956. Most of the deline in employment last month stemmed from unusually bad weather, which curtailed farm work more than usual, the report said."
"500,000	higher than a year ago. The report said that the November additions to the list of unemployed v-'ere largely laid-off farmhands and people who were looking for Christmas jobs but had not found them."
"4-Month Decline Ends Unemployment had been falling for four months from a June peak of 3.337,000. It has risen every November in the last seven years, but all of those increases were smaller than this November’s."
"The, federation president went before the convention of Mr. Gray’s own department to assert that only employers would benefit from a wage freeze. Mr. Meany contended that increased mass purchasing power, based on higher pay, was needed to guard the country against a recession."
"Secretary of Labor James P, Mitchell, who appeared at the convention, was guarded in his comments on Mr. Gray’s plan. However, he urged that the idea “be seriously considered” as a contribution to reducing' housing costs. •"
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 17-Personal income declined in October for the second straight month. It was the first two-month decline since late 1953 and early 1954, when income fell for several months in the middle of a mild business recession. 6"
"The Commerce Department reported today that personal income in October had been at a rate of 5345,600,000,000 a year, after allowing for normal seasonal factors. This was $1,000,-000,000 lower than in September, which was $200,000,000 lower than the peak rate of August—$346,800,000,000."
"The October decline was concentrated primarily in payrolls in manufacturing industries. Wage rates in manufacturing held at their record levels, but employment fell and so did Sours worked in a week."
"Factory production, particularly in durable goods, has been at less than record volume all year. It dipped further in October."
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 10—If the test of an American political ""liberal” has become whether he agrees with the British Labor party that, when there is inflation and unemployment, the shortest route to a stable economy, full employment and peak productivity is to inflate some more, then the authors of last Sunday’s manifesto of the Democratic Advisory Council are authentic modern liberals. In the presence of an oncoming Federal deficit of $12 billion they would increase Government spending, one of the sure causes and prods of inflation, by more billions than they attempted to estimate. And this is about all they had to say on the matter of taxes to help pay the bill:"
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 — November produced a record in consumers’ retail spending and better than usual performance in employment and unemployment, according to government reports issued today."
"The reports also showed that wholesale industrial prices had risen for the fifth consecutive month. Though the relationship between wholesale and consumer prices is not direct, the persistent increase ,at the wholesale level is hardly an indication of prolonged stability at the consumer level."
"The Commerce Department reported that retail sales in No-vembr amounted o $17,279,000,-000. This did not approach the Christmas record of $19,844,-000,000 established last year,! but when such seasonal bulges are put in perspective it exceeded the “seasonally adjusted1’ record set in the summer of 1957."
"In non-farm work, after making allowance for normal seasonal trends, there was an increase in employment. The increase, however, did not quite offset the drop in October,"
"The group argued that the effects of the defense pick-up on the economy ""cannot yet be clearly ascertained.” It said the pick-up ""may have major immediate consequences” even though actual spending would rise only slowly."
"T^hus, the group continued, the Government should rely for now upon “expansionary monetary and credit actions”— meaning 4n easy money policy by the Federal Reserve. These actions, the group said, “can be quickly reversed should inflationary pressures again become dominant.”"
"The report was released shortly after the House of Representatives 'had passed, by 328—71, a bill increasing the $275,000,000,000 national debt ceiling by $5,000,000,000. The temporary increase would be in effect until June 30, 1959."
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 4— Economists for two business-oriented organizations criticized today the President’s economic report. They said it had not come to grips with the problems of inflation or recession."
"Would liay Groundwork Referring! to the current recession, Mr. Stein challenged the report for not having recognized the possibility of a slump’s lasting beyond, midyear. He said the Administration and Congress should be discussing the prospect of an emergency tax cut, and when—and how to apply it “The economic report should have laid the groundwork,” he declared."
"WASHINGTON, Feb; 5 — President Eisenhower reaffirmed today that the Administration might favor a tax cut to brake the recession unless the economy turned upward by mid-year."

New York State unemployment—as measured by jobless insurance benefits—continued its sharp decline last week.
"The number of workers drawing- unemployment payments came to 446,000. This figure represents a drop of 24,000 from the previous week, when the decrease was 37,500. The data were released yesterday by the State Labor Department."
69.000	applications from persons who had exhausted their twenty-six weeks of protection under the regular program and who are now eligible for extended benefits under the new Federal program.
"WASHINGTON, July 16—The recession was a shade deeper in the first quarter of this year than earlier figures indicated, revised estimates of the gross national product showed today."
"Figures for the entire period, but particularly since 1952, were increased.' The basic outline of the economy, however, remains essentially unchanged."
"The new figures put the gross national product in the third quarter of last year (at the peak of the boom) at $445,600,000,-000. The earlier estimate was $440,000,000,000. The new figures for the first quarter of this year is $425,800,000,000. Thus the decline comes to $19,800,-000,000, against $18,000,000,000 in the earlier computations."

It is how best to arrest the recession and reduce unemployment, now at nearly , where the question must be I settled Within the Administration and by President Eisenhower, here the voters themselves will decide Monday whether tax cuts or public works offer the best and quickest, method."
"WASHINGTON, May 23—The number of workers receiving unemployment insurance registered its biggest drop of the year in the week ended May 10, the Labor Department reported today."
It was the fourth consecutive weekly decline. The four-week period marked the first time that insured unemployment had declined by more than usual for the season.
The bureau said the greater part of the latest decline had stemmed from seasonal improvement in outdoor work and related activities.
"It said that part of the decline was attributable to the fact that many unemployed workers were exhausting their jrights to collect insurance, be-| cause they had been unemployed for long periods. They may still be unemployed, but they are not counted among the ""insured unemployed.’*"
"The number of workers drawing unemployment Insurance here went up again last week. The upstate total declined, but the drop was substantially short of seasonal expectations."
"Insured joblessness in upstate communities was 154 per cent above the level for the same week: a year ago, the highest ratio since the recession began. This represented a gain of 5 per cent over the previous week, even though the number of workers on the rolls went down to 188,000, a decline of- 5,400."
"In this city, insuranfce lists rose 2,100 to a total of 245,500. The increase brought the two-week rise in the metropolitan area to 4,800. However, the New York picture remained less acute in relative terms than the situation elsewhere jn the state. For the city the rolls stood 62 per cent higher than last year."
"However, the continuation of this downward trend brought little comfort to analysts at the State Labor Department because of two developments. One was a rise in the number of new claims, both here and upstate. This is the most sensitive measure of fresh unemployment."
"WASHINGTON, April 29— Unemployment in the nation declined by 78,000 from mid-March to mid-April, from 5,198,-000 to 5,120,000."
"This reversed, at least temporarily, a steady upward trend that began in November. The drop, however, was much less than is normal for this season of the year."
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 (AP) —Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee said today that he thought the public would back Congress in adopting a realistic legislative program to halt inflation."
"Mr. Kafauver, in a year-end statement as chairman of the Senate Antitrust subcommittee, pictured the American public as indignant over rising living , costs."
The Democratic Senator Said that the rising living costs and inflationary pressures were the top domestic problems of the times.
Mr. Kefauver said that the steel industry had used a wage increase to its workers in 19581 as the excuse to increase steel prices “about twice as much as the wage increase.”
"During this time of price pressures, the Senator said that he did not believe labor in the basic industries “should demand or receive any wage increase which management could justify as the basis for absolutely necessary price increases. To do so would add to the inflationary spiral.”"
"In 1933 the Congress, responding^ the baton of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, poured out a staccato flourish of new laws—to reopen sound banks, to bring mortgage relief, to aid fanners by paying them to grow less, to permit lowering the gold content of the dollar and to establish many of the innumerable New DeaJ agencies designed in one way er another to work for recovery. In the New Deal’s first year, for example, twenty-six new government recovery agencies were established, ranging alphabetically from A. A. A. (Agricultural Adjustment Administration) to T. V. A. (Tennessee Valley Authority)."

Isador Lubin, the Commissioner, spoke at the opening of a four-day hearing before the Joint Legislative Committee on Industrial and Labor Conditions at the Astor Hotel. The committee .is getting suggestions for new legislation for the coming session of the Legislature. Mr. Lubin said that in September, 1957, only 4 per cent"
"“On top of that,” he said, “we will have to find jobs for about 75,000 new workers who will enter the labor market in the next year. That 75,000 is net, allowing for people who die or retire.

"WASHINGTON, May 15— The Director of the Budget formally confirmed today reports that the Government was expecting a budget deficit of $8,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000 in the fiscal year that begins July 1."
"The director, Maurice H. Stans, made the estimate in a speech to the National Rivers and Harbors Conference. He said that the size of the deficit ""compels us to rethink our work program and look critically at each one of the additional expenditure proposals being urged upon us.”"
Mr. Stans noted that defense costs were higher and that there would be additional expenses imposed by anti-recession measures.
"Larger Budgets Forecast He said that “we are moving rapidly toward $80,000,000,000 budgets” and added that this ""could well mean extended deficit spending.”"
"His ""tentative” estimate of the deficit indicated a new estimate of receipts of about $70,000,000,000, compared with | the estimate of $74,400,000,000 in the January budget."
"WASHINGTON, April 23-President Eisenhower referred to the economic recession today as a “minor emergency” that people should not get “hysterical” about."
At his news conference the President warned anew against any tax reduction as an antirecession device. He cited the increasing costs of defense and said the nation must not forget “the grave international emergency” w’hile preoccupied with problems of individual incomes at the moment. [See Questions

"WASHINGTON, April 1— President Eisenhower signed the 51,850,000,000 emergency housing bill today. The new law: is the first major anti-recession housing bill passed by Congress."
He embraced other features of the bill as “consistent with Administration proposals.” He said they would stimulate the economy through acceleration of construction.
"WASHINGTON, March 14— The first indication of the March trend in unemployment reveals no improvement."
"The Labor Department reported today that new claims for unemployment insurance, a rough measure of new lay-offs, rose to 440,400 in the first week of March. This was far above the 235,800 of a year ago and a gain of 4,500 for the week. March usually shows a decline in claims."
"Heretofore, the loans under this particular form of Federal aid, carried out through an agency known as the Community Facilities Administration, had been used al-|most exclusively for construction of water and sewer systems. Under the new legislation their use would be encouraged for a wide variety of useful projects including streets, bridges, parks, hospitals, libraries, water and timber conservation, and public schools. In his report Sena-! [tor Fulbright correctly noted that such projects ""are desperately needed in most sections of the country""; and it was his hope that stimulation of construction activity along these lines would “aid in economic recovery.”"
"LONDON. Feb. 28—The Stock Market Improved today despite the renewed weakness of sterling, decreased industrial activity in the United Kingdom, and the .depressing business news from America."
"Although net changes in the Industrial market were irregular, gains exceeded losses in most principal groups. However, shipping and shipbuilding shares remained dull on the news of an increase in the number of ships laid up. Store shares made a good recovery as did chemicals. Shares with an American content also made a good showing, although most of the improvement seemetrto be the result of marking up to take account of the rise on i Wall Street."

"WASHINGTON, April 8,—A maze of Government figures on jobs and joblessness added up today to some further deterioration in March, after allowance for normal seasonal expectations. Although the' total number of employed increased over February, mostly because of farming, and unemployment rose slightly, the key figure showed a sharp decline."
"This is the figure for nonfarm employment, officially adjusted to allow for normal seasonal changes expected in the month. It dropped by 300,000 more in March—only half as much as in February but more than in any other month since the recession began last August."
"But George Meany, president of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, said the figures ""indicate a continued deepening of the recession.” Mr. Meany stressed the failure of the job situation to improve as much as normal experience for March would indicate. He concluded that “the only way to change the situation is for the Government to act now.”"
"WASHINGTON, March 9—1 Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the Capitol called today for an immediate program of stepped-up public works, Federal aid to depressed communities and expanded unemployment compensation to counter the nation’s growing economic recession."
"WASHINGTON, March 10-Vice President Richard M. Nixon said today he favored a tax cut over a massive spending program if further Governmental anti-recession ■ action proved necessary."
"Mr. Nixon voiced this view shortly after the Department of Commerce reported that consumer buying declined substantially in February, the first such drop since the recession began."
The difference between a political approach and a factual approach to the problem of unemployment is well illustrated by the differing statements of President Eisenhower and the economists of the First National City Bank.
"Just how the unemployed, more and more of whom are exhausting their unemployment benefits, could do this, he did not say. Nor can those who are on part-time work but not called unemployed add to their buying. And it is certainly not unreasonable for people who do not know when the axe of lay-offs will hit them to be cautious in their spending."
"Your paper reports in its editorial, the same cay that it reported the President’s press conference, that the economists of the First National City Bank had said that labor income has declined over ?5 billion between last August and January. The bank economists concluded: “The chance for a spontaneous increase in consumer spending appears slim until * * * some dramatic stimulus to spending makes its appearance.” This is the factual approach to unemployment."
"It would be a dramatic stimulus if the Federal Government reduced taxes temporarily by raising the exemptions for individuals and dependents in the income tax law, thus immediately increasing purchasing power, or adopted a really ade-. quate program for more of such useful public works as schools, hospitals, roads, and housing for the elderly. It is not a dramatic stimulus for the President to keep repeating his confidence calls, for he has been doing that with no visible success for some time."
"Now there la a further Indication—the rising rate at which individuals and businesses are spending their checkbook dollars. During July, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports, turnover of checking accounts, adjusted for seasonal! variation, increased 10 per cent in New York, 6% per cent ini six other leading financial centers and 3 per cent in 337 other cities. These rises more than offset declines in June—the only month to show a downturn this year."
"“Meanwhile, wages were in-j creased 39 cents an hour,” he said, adding: “It is necessary for the packers to face up squarely to the problem of Inflation. Profits are so small that any increase in wages must be reflected in the cost of meat or the price paid for livestock, or both."" The Prophet Company of Detroit indicated yesterday that profits were good by declaring the regular 15-cent quarterly dividend and an extra of 16 cents. Last year the company paid no extras."

"Yesterday, in the face of reports of economic recovery, the State Division of Employment Security disclosed that the number of unemployed in the state had risen to 221,000 in January. This was the highest figure for any January since the World War H demobilization in 1946 and represented 9.3 per cent of the labor force in the state."
"The post-World War II unemployment peak was reached in March and June of 1958, when the number of idle workers rose to 222,000, or 8.4 per cent of the labor force."

"LOUISVILLE, Ky„ June 23— The recession blew Louisville’s dream world sky high. It made the city realize that it could not coast on tradition, no matter how rich, nor cash in on suburban growth while downtown decayed."
"Far-sighted civic leaders had sounded warnings a decade ago. These were dismissed frequently as “mouthings of gloom-and-doom boys.” After the event, however, even a Chamber of Commerce study had this to say: ""The Louisville economy suffered its most severe decline between about mid-1957 and mid-1958. In retrospect, it appears- that the local recession began a little earlier and lasted a little longer than for most of the country.”"
"Job Total Lags Business picked up greatly in the last half of 1958. Yet year-end figures showed all non-farm jobs down 5 per cent, manufacturing employment down more than 10 per cent and railroad car loadings off more than 9 per cent for the twelve-month period."
"WASHINGTON, April 16—. The Labor Department—by coincidence rather than design— published today a set of productivity figures for the steel industry that could affect the forthcoming wage bargaining."
"At the request of reporters, Mr. Clague made an additional rough calculation of steel productivity quarter by quarter over the last two years. Using an index of 100 for the first quarter of 1957, productivity by this measure fell to 84.7 in the first quarter of 1958, the recession low, and had risen to"

"Roger M. Blough, the steel executive, asserted that in order for the Government to help combat inflation it must understand that ""spending more than its revenues, and constantly adding to the money supply, is an easy and quite certain way to inflation.’’"
"Mr. Blough said that the establishment of wage and price controls at the national level would not be a remedy for inflation. Instead, he contended, such action ""would weaken the productive strength of the thousands of corporate groups all over the country as a corrective measure for Government spending more than its revenues and for great union power.”"

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 16—A new Secretary of the Treasury has been appointed, and thoughts turn naturally to high finance —gold, interest rates, economic vitality and related matters."
"He also ordered the acceleration of all other state programs that could better conditions directly or indirectly. He took the actions at a meeting with , his Cabinet devoted entirely to the economic problem."
"As of March 1, the entire state qualified as a distressed area under Federal standards with 9.2 per cent of the total available labor force of 2,506,-150 unemployed. The percentage of jobless is the largest since July, 1958, when 247,800, or 9.9 per cent of the labor force, were idle."
"John W. Tramburg, State Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies, told the Governor he was seeking to get under construction before suinmer $27,-.000,600 in new hospital facilities. Before July 1, $20,000,000 more will be.spent and $15,000,-000 will be added later in the year for new structures at state colleges in Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, Union and Glassboro."
"Mr. Reuther, who is president of the 1,200,000-member union, noted that President Kennedy I had expressed his opposition to a shorter work week because there were so many unfilled needs in the nation. But, the union leader asked, “what about the 5,600,000 unemployed workers who would like to work forty hours but aren’t given one hour work a week?’’"
"Mr. Reuther praised President Kennedy’s efforts to alleviate the hardships of unemployment, but he said that the Adminis- i “It Ithe President’s program] idoes not deal with the basic | structural weaknesses within | the American economy out of which we have had three recessions in eight years,” Mr. jReuther said. ""Yes, we need a !few more aspirin to relieve the jstress and strain and hardships ;of unemployment, but we need deep economic surgery in the American economy or we are going to go from recession to recession.”"
"City Treasurer Hilda G. Schwartz reported yesterday that for the fiscal year ended last Friday the city took in 5566,632,327 in special taxes, or 55.604.083	more than in fiscal 1953-60. The special taxes, levied largely on sales and general business, are the cornerstone of the city’s general fund."
"The top business barometer levies, the retail sales tax and the business-financial tax, brought in, respectively, $5,-594,342 and $4,328,754 more than in the preceding fiscal year. The sales tax total was $302,463,104. The yield of the business-financial tax was $180,-131,196."
"604.083	over-all increase was “especially significant” because it was achieved without the 10-cent-a-ride taxi levy. This tax, which expired a year ago, had brought $16,309,872 in 1959-60."
"The Treasurer reported that the city collected $1,012,959,-128 in real estate taxes in 1960-61, with 96.55 per cent of the entire levy paid at the end of the year. In the last three years, Mrs. Schwartz said, her office has reduced tax arrears and consequent realty foreclosures by introducing new informational procedures and reminders to taxpayers."
"WASHINGTON, June 13-President Kennedy asked Congress today to modernize the nation's unemployment compensation system by increasing coverage, benefits and payroll taxes."
"Anti-recession programs have been sent to Congress, the President noted, but “it is apparent that there will be those [in the future] who will be unemployed at various times.” “Putting the current temporary thirjgen-week extension of Federal - state unemployment benefits on a permanent basis for steady workers."
"In the permanent area, the President would establish a program of aid to those jobless who have exhausted state and temporary Federal benefits, and whose ""entitlement to benefits was equal to at least twenty-six weeks of total unemployment."" •"
"JOHNSON CITY, Tex., Jan. 3 —Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz suggested today that one partial solution to the unemployment problem might be an increase in the current time-and-a-half rate for overtime pay."
"Stock prices on the exchange broke yesterday to the lowest point in almost four years. It was the fourth successive sharp drop and took The New York Times combined average substantially beldw the close on May 28, the day of the big break. Volume yesterday was the heaviest since May 31."
"The exchange, in its report on last month’s gyrations, said the recovery that began on the afternoon of May 29 was led by buying on the part of the larger investors, including, presumably, the mutual funds and institutional investors. They also were buyers on May 28 and May 31."
"As the advance continued on Thursday, May 31, many investors in the middle-income bracket came into the market with buying orders, the study said."
"MIAMI BEACH, Sept. 16-The leaders of the United Steelworkers of America chided President Kennedy today, holding- that he had not acted forcefully enough to reduce unemployment and promote economic growth."
"The steel union is a political ally of the Kennedy Administration, and the rebuke was given gently. Nevertheless, it was indicative of a mounting frustration among labor leaders, who are dissatisfied with the country’s economic performance."
"The advocacy by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Or-j ganizations of a 35-hour weekj to reduce unemployment is a: symptom of this frustration. The leaders of the steel union reiterated today' that a cut in hours was, in their view, the only way to return to full employment in the steel industry."
The union’s leaders reserved their harshest comments for what they regard as Congressional conservatism and public apathy despite continuing high unemployment. They indicated that they attributed the Ad-
"The Citizens and Southern' National Bank of Atlanta, a leading bank in the South, announced yesterday an increase in its basic interest rate on business ioans. Its action touched off fresh speculation that banks generally would raise interest rates."
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 — The Kennedy Administration is making ready to fight for a planned across-the-board tax reduction next year on the grounds that unemployment could reach as high as 6 Vs per cent without it."
"A gain in the gross national product of a little more than .S20.000.000 is what the Administration economists forsee for next year if tax rates remain unchanged. Powever, the Administration will argue that even with an increase of that amount unemployment will increase instead of decrease."
"Since the total number of workers increases annually and the amount they produce per man-hour has also been rising, real economic growth of about 3 per cent a year is required to maintain the unemployment level. As of November, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 5.8 per cent of the work force."
"WASHINGTON May 14 (UPI) — President Kennedy asked Congress today to extend unemployment coverage to 3,-000,000 more people through revisions that “will add to our built-in defenses against recession.”"
"He submitted a bill that would give the long-term unemployed up to 26 extra weeks of Government benefits after that amount of state compensation had run out. Thus, benefits for such persons would be available for a full year. - •"
In addition the measure would increase the amounts to unemployed workers to half the weekly wages they had received. The employers’ tax would be increased to help pay for the program.
"Despite the decline, the index last month remained enough above the August level to provide wage increases of 1 cent an hour for 985,000 workers whose pay is adjusted quarterly according to changes in the index."
"About 780,000 of the workers are in the automobile and automobile parts industry, 110,000 are in the farm equipment industry and most of the rest in the aerospace and general metalworking fields. About 11,000	workers will receive increases of 2 to 4 cents an hour based on quarterly, semiannual or annual reviews."
"According to the weekly statement of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, free reserves of member banks averaged $320,000,000 on a daily basis and $402,000,000 last Wednesday."
"This was above the revised levels for the previous week, when the banks had $284,000,-000 in free reserves on a daily average and only 5118.000,000 on Wednesday."
"Despite, the increased reserves, commercial and industrial loans at leading New York City banks fell by 559,000,000 in the week ended Wednesday."
"These loans had shown an increase of 590,000,000 during the previous week and had risen $80,000,000 in the same period a year ago."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28—A chief economic policymaker insisted today tl^t the best attack on high unemployment must be a tax cut to stimulate demand and thereby create lobs."
"Available evidence, he said, does not show that the part of the unemployment problem labeled “structural” by economists has increased significantly ""Structural unemployment” is the term used for the mismatching of workers with available jobs, which results because of location, lack of skill or education, sex, age, race and so on."
"Some economists hold that the structural problem, because of rapid technological change and shifts in consumer demand from goods to services, has become so severe that tax cuts will not solve unemployment unless accompanied by massive Federal programs such as retraining and aid to education."
"Small gains predominated in the industrial issues. Steel, department stores and tobacco shares stood out."
"Commercial and industrial loans made by both New York and Chicago banks showed a substantial rise in the week ended Wednesday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."
"There was no change in the Treasury gold stock, so that the total loss of gold in 1962 amounted to $912,000,000. In 1961, there was a drop of $877,-000,000 which means that last year’s loss was somewhat greater despite the fact that the deficit in the nation’s balance of payments—the amount of total United States dollar losses to foreigners — is expected to. be less than the $2,500,000,000 registered in 1961."
"The average of daily free reserves, which is one of the leading indicators of credit conditions, amounted to $236,000,000, while actual free reserves on Wednesday were $327,000,000."
"Retail sales held at the record high reached in November, the board said. Industrial production last month was 120 per cent of the 1957-59 average, the same as in November. From July to December, the production index held between 119 and 120 per cent."
"500,000,000 in November, changed little in December. Residential construction increased a little, but public construction declined, although remaining higher than in the summer months."
"The board said automobile assemblies remained at the advanced level prevailing since last July, and the preliminary production schedules for January indicate little change. The output of home goods and apparel increased further in December returning to the May-June high, butt the output of television sets was unchanged from the reduced October-No-vember level."
"Although more issues advanced than declined, losses ranging from a fraction to a point or more among key issues on the New York Stock Exchange pushed down the averages. Higher priced issues were down more sharply."
"Brokers attributed the decline in quality stocks to long-term profit taking. Chrysler, the day’s most active stock, was an apparent victim of such activity. It fell Its to 7214 despite news that its December auto sales were at the highest level for the month since 1955."
"Volume dropped to 2,540,000 shares from Monday’s heavy vear-end activity, when 5,420,-000 shares were traded. Yesterday's turnover was the smallest since the semi-holiday of Oct. 12, when 2,020,000 shares changed hands."
"The New York Times industrial average closed at 610. < 4, off 611. The rail average closed at 106.22, up .07. and the combined average closed at 35».4&, off 3.02. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 646:79, off 5.31, and Standard & Poor s 500 stocks index lost .41."
"The break was the sharpest in nine sessions, but its impact was softened by the radically curtailed volume."
"The stock market kept moving irregularly higher this week, with longer periods of downtrend and uptrend. However, the principal encouraging sign—for those who hope the advance still has some way to go—was the decline in volume that always accompanies downturns. Based on The New York Times combined average for 50 stocks. The market closed 1 point higher on the week."
"Increasingly, the gains being recorded in the market seem to be concentrated in stocks of companies that do not—year in and year out—make much money. These are stocks that one buys in the hope that they are .going up, and sells them when the rise is completed. The old bread - and - butter issues, which a true investor can buy for income over the next decade, are moving much more quietly."
"Of all the stocks appearing on the most active list last week, the greatest percentage rise from the 1962-63 low was recorded by Chrysler—up 116 per cent. Perhaps Chrysler has solved its problems at last, but historically it has been only one of the least profitable of the major automobiles makers."
"Individual stocks are moved by their own results, of course, but the list of active stocks reveals that the action of late has been in stocks that are bought and sold, rather than in stocks that are bought and held. This makes a market vulnerable to a turn-around, if the news is ever such to produce a turnaround."
"Viewing the entire market movement since the Cuban crisis, it is obviously not based on any increase in the outlook for corporate earnings. Rather, it reflects a new confidence in the Administration's competence to deal with the nation’s vast problems both at home and abroad."
"The railroads participated only mildly in the late l'ecovery and they closed mostly lower. Since their sharp spurt on Monday after the Supreme Court decision on featherbedding practices, the rail averages have lost a fourth of their gains based on the averages."
"The Dow-Jones rail average finished at 152.15, a decline of 0.90, after being down 1.17 at 2 P.M. Standard and Poor's rail group closed 0.19 lower at 31.68."

"An improved tone .prevailed in the stock market yesterday, and prices on the New York Stock Exchange closed with moderate gains for the eighth consecutive session. The trading volume increased to 4,120,-000 shares from 3,350,000 on Tuesdav."
"Most of the advance was made in the first two hours,-when trading was moderately active. After that, trading slackened, but prices held most of their gains until near the close when some easiness developed."
"The motor group, led by Chrysler, again was firm on reports that production would probably remain at its present high level well into the summer."
The New York Times combined average of 50 stocks moved up 0.91 point and closed at 374.11. The 25 rails rose 0.31 to 112.03 and the 25 industrials gained 1.50 to 636.18.

"The measure is designed to curb what the Administration regards as an inflationary boom in business spending for equipment and buildings. The boom has put excessive strains on supplies of capital goods, skilled manpower and credit,"
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21—1 Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler warned the members of Congress today that they would be playing “political Russian roulette"" and risking an election defeat next fall if they refused to vote for a tax increase and if severe inflation followed."
"Members of Congress who listen to ""wholly normal but uninformed taxpayer reaction and vote against the tax increase” may later on face “a voter backlash with painful political consequences,"" Mr. Fowler said in a speech to the National Press Club."
"He said that the alternative to a tax increase was ""an economy in shambles"" and that the member of Congress who ""reads only his current mail and ignores the economic indicators” would live to find this out."
"He said, however, that if the rate of inflation in consumer prices reached 5 y2 per cent a year, as it did in the first two years of the Korean war. the average family would lose more in purchasing power through inflation than it would from the tax increase."
"j Arthur M. Ross.

"Nathaniel Goldfinger, research director of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, told the committee that working people were already feeling the pinch of higher prices while corporate profits continued to soar."
"But with inflation signs everywhere in the economy, and price pressures likely to get a further push from whatever settlement is worked out in the auto strike, the big question is how long can easy money continue?"
"And if the Federal Reserve does decide to tighten up, what will this do to interest rates, which are already very high by traditional American standards? Is there a. new “credit crunch” in the wings, like the one last year, that put the nation’s savings institutions under tremendous stress and sent the housing industry into a tail spin?"
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 21—The rise in prices accelerated in September, the Department of Labor reported today, as the Consumer Price Index rose one-half of 1 per cent to 136.6, after adjustment for seasonal factors."
"The steep rise in the index, which measures the costs of food, clothing, housing and other consumer goods and services, followed three months of relatively modest increases."
Another report issued by the Labor Department today indicated that the real purchasing power of American workers dropped sharply last month because of rising prices and reduced working hours.
"Democratic members o( Congress and other critics, such as George Meany, the labor leader, said this afternoon that the upturn in prices proved the Nixon Administration’s program to slow inflation had failed."
"However, Administration officials termed the September price results an aberration and reiterated that their program to restore economic health to the nation was working."

"WASHINGTON, Aug. 14— A massive adverse swing of nearly $l-billion in flows of stock-market funds into and out of the United. States produced a “real” worsening of the balance of payments in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported today."
"The over-all figures for deficits and surpluses have become largely meaningless, it is widely agreed, in large part because of the distorting effects of Eurodollar transactions. These figures showed a record second-quarter deficit of $3,792,000,000 on the familiar “liquidity” basis of definition and a surplus of $1,249,000,000 on the “official settlements” basis of definition—both figures larger than in the first quarter."

"It is true that we have just passed through a decade when the economy spent most of the time far off the course of reasonably full employment and price stability.

"The average number of unemployed persons in the area, the report said, was 300,000, of whom 159,000 were New York City residents. The city labor force was estimated at 3.3 million."
"The increase in the unemployment rate in the city, 3.6 in 1969 to 4.8 in the last year compared with national averages of 3.5 to 4.9 for the same period."
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — The Department of Labor disclosed today how it would allocate $200-million for emergency public service jobs to areas with high unemployment."
"The funds, to be distributed in October, will go to cities, counties and neighborhoods where unemployment has been in excess of 6 per cent."
"The bond and money markets took heart from what occurred at the Rome meeting and seemed to decide to emphasize the positive. Most interest rates edged down, and there was talk or further gains extending into the new year. - “The settlement of the mone-tary differences should be immediately salutary to our market,” observed the Bankers Trust Company in noting late jin the week that this , hope temporarily overshadowed” Phase Two as; a day-to-day influence on prices of fixed-income securities."

""While one might have expected such news to be taken bearishly by the Government market because of its ultimate adverse effect on bill rates and its implications for a better domestic economy, the market actually strengthened,” the firm says."
"This it attributes to the fact that foreign holders, “who will certainly liquidate dollar holdings when parities are re-established, are not' doing so now.” In fact, Lanston continues, several nations are still accumulating.dollars and ivesting them here, particularly in bills. -Such demand, combined with heavy official buying by the Federal Reserve during the week, helped give the money market an easier tone. ."
"The index, whicli is compiled each month by the Department of Labor, showed that prices paid by typical urban consumers rose two-tenths of 1 per cent in September. The rise contrasts with an average monthly increase of twice that much in the preceding six months."
"While some of the September rise could be accounted for by exemptions from the freeze, and some of it by technicalities involved in preparing the price index, there were other increases for which Government economists said there were “no obvious explanations.’’ Investigations Planned"
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8—Unemployment remained essentially unchanged in September, but employment showed a substantial rise, particularly in the key manufacturing sector of the economy, the Labor Department reported today."
"130,000	jobs. This was seen as particularly significant because lit was the first such rise since May and was the largest gain in a single month in more than five years, except for months in which major strikes were settled."
"While Labor Department experts.cautioned, as always, that the developments of a single month did not demonstrate a trend, they did note that the gain in manufacturing employment was very widespread among different industries and said that this had to be regarded as a hopeful sign."
The danger of rank-and-file upset of a pact providing gains nearly double those the Transport Workers Union won in the jumbo contract that ended the twelve-day subway and bus paralysis of 1966 epitomizes the difficulties created in labor-management relations all over the country by the wavering course of the Administration’s wage stabilization effort.
"In addition, a three-jump increase will give the subway and bus workers 6 per cent in extra pay for all night-shift and weekend work, plus a $20,000 major medical insurance policy and a fistful of other fringe benefits. The basic wage of. subway motormen will rise from $11,066 a year to $13,180, exclusive of overtime and shift differentials. Porters, at the bottom of the pay scale, will go from $8,451 a year to $10,064."
"Looking at the headlines late last week, many credit market analysts concluded that it was difficult to make a case for a continuation of the bright new trend toward lower interest rates."
"All these developments could be used in support of the view that interest rates should move higher, and yet bond yields declined last week for the first time since mid-March."
"Similarly in the tax-exempt bond market, The Bond Buyer’s yield index last week dropped 10-100ths of a percentage point to 5.86 per cent —its first decline since mid-March."
"WASHINGTON, March 3 — The nation’s unemployment rate declined in February for the second consecutive month and reached the lowest level since October, 1970, the Labor Department reported today."
"5.7	per cent in February, compared with 5.9 per cent in January and about 6 per cent all through 1971, may mark the beginning of a dowhward trend, but the results of additional months will be necessary before this conclusion can be established."
"WASHINGTON, July 24 —| Broad-based but nonscientific| polls taken In preparation fori drafting the Republican na-| tional platform in Miami Beach next month indicate that crime, drugs, inflation, welfare and Federal spending are among the most urgent issues facing Americans."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23—By the time it recessed last Friday for the Republican National Convention. Congress had already added $5,2-billion to the budget deficit, a Congressional ■'scorekeeping"" report disclosed today."
"The biggest item in the latest; scorekeeping report was the 201 per cent increase in Social Security benefits. The legislation added $2.1-billion to spending and, by postponing a tax increase until next January, reduced revenues by $1.6-billion from the proposals in President Nixon’s budget."
"The next biggest item was a bill greatly liberalizing ""black lung” benefits for coal miners, which will add just under $1-billion to spending."
"Led by sharply higher food prices, the Consumer Price Index for February posted its ""largest one-month increase in 22 years, the Labor Department reported today. Prices of many nonfood items, notably heating oil, also went up."
"The department reported that the index climbed seven-tenths of 1 per cent last month, or eight-tenths after adjusting the statistics to account for the dip that usually occurs in February."

"Figures the department made public showed that the December deficit, originally reported at $563.2-million, had been revised downward to $441.1-million, bringing to $6.3-billion the deficit for all of 1972."
"ALBANY,. Feb. 14—After feeling the recession sooner, more severely and at greater length than the rest of the country, New York State is “at'last” participating in: the' economic recovery, the stater’s Council of Economic Advisers has concluded."
"Reviewing 1972, the council listed various indicators that showed the state rebounding from its longest economic slump in at least two decades. The “most dependable and broadest based,” the council asserted, is ""the turn-around in nonagricultural employment,” which began dropping in October, 1969, and finally turned back up last summer."
"A ""disturbing trend,” the council said, is the “absolute contraction"" of the labor force. Many workers have moved out of the state to other labor markets, the report said."
The stock market sagged again yesterday in moderate trading and closed at its lowest level since mid-November.
"The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.08 points and finished at 996.46—its first close beneath the 1,000 level since Nov. 15, the day after it had closed above 1,000 for the first time in history."
No specific news developments were responsible for the market’s decline yesterday. It has been falling ever since President Nixon announced the details of Phase 3 of his economic program on Jan. 11.
"The Dow Jones cumulative loss since then has been 55,24 points and it has declined in nine of the last 11 market sessions, demonstrating that Wall Street is concerned about the possibility of renewed inflationary pressures and tight money."
"President Nixon’s formal message yesterday was not deemed a market factor, except to the extent that Wall Street doubts the ability of the Administration to put a lid on Federal spending and to reduce the Federal budget deficit."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 11—The Nixon Administration’s pro-, gram for stopping inflation by direct controls on wages and prices has always been full of anomalies."
"It was begun at a time when the economy was running far below capacity, with heavy unemployment, and is being partly dismantled at a time when the economy is coming closer to full employment—the reverse of the traditional schedule."
"Virtually all commodity futures contracts' were sharply lower yesterday, with the energy crisis and the break in the stock market as the major causes. It is unusual for so many commodity markets to be swept by lack of confidence and by interest in selling out at the same time."
"The selling wave in grains and soybeans followed a news item that Japanese freighters, which make up one of the largest fleets of carriers, were stranded in several major foreign ports, unable to obtain fuel, and also in ports along the East Coast of the United States."
"Until recently the prices of soybeans have been rising steadily, bolstered by heavy foreign buying. The sharp soybean and grain selloff yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade “spilled over,” as one broker commented, into contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a center for trading live cattle, live hogs and pork bellies, the raw material for bacon."
"In other markets selling also took over. For example, the prospect of shortages in shipping space brought a decline in world sugar prices. Sugar buyers do not like to risk buying sugar from exporting nations if they cannot be sure of making delivery."
"Copper prices, which have been surging upward until recently, dropped 1to 3 cents a pound yesterday, despite indications of continuing nearby shortages. A downturn in home building and a cutback in production of large autos influenced traders’ thinking."

"UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Aug. 24 — Secretary General Waldheim asked today for a $513.4-milIion budget to cover United Nations expenses in the coming two years, and said that dollar devaluation and inflation in the United States had Increased the costs of running the organization."
"The budget for 1974 was estimated at $253.7-million — up about $28.5-million from the current one, An increase of $11.8-millicm was ascribed to rising cost of operating the establishment and to outlays for wages to the 8,915 staff members in the inflating situation. Currency rate changes were estimated to have meant an additional burden of $8.7-million. An additional $5.5-million is budgeted for normal expansion of United Nations programs."
"The United States, which pays the largest share of the budget, succeeded last year in getting its assessment cut from 30.25 per cent to 25 per cent, which means it will be paying about $62-million in each of the next two calendar years."
"TRENTON, Sept. 10-Governor Cahill and the State Legislature combined today to approve a bill providing up to 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits."
"Senator Barry T. Parker, Republican of Burlington County, said today’s action in a special session of the Legislature was needed to aid victims of the state’s “persistent unemployment” who ran out of their original benefits, which can run as long as 26 weeks, depending on the worker’s eligibility."
"The steep climb in interest rates, which has already carried the price of short-term money to record levels, shows no signs of approaching a plateau and, in all likelihood, will continue to advance toward a presently obscured summit until well past Labor Day."
"Markets who have watched the long-term markets crack during the last two weeks, leaving no sector of the credit markets unaffected by efforts to curb inflation."
"“The prevailing market pessimism is founded on expectations of increasing Fed restraint as it perseveres in its attempt to slow the stubbornly strong growth in the monetary aggregates, on few conclusive signs, as yet, that demand pressures in the economy are easing sufficiently to cool off excessive inflationary pressures, and on a Government wage-price controls program that has fallen flat on its face,” the Treasury securities firm of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., Inc., said in its latest market letter."
"DuPont-Walston, Inc., said Friday that this ""dismal scene” would not end until a time, “possibly around October, when the cost of funds will become so expensive as to be prohibitive.”"
"A $161-million-a-year rate increase for Consolidated Edison electric customers has been proposed by a state Public Service Commission examiner, with opponents contending that a new concept included in the proposal would anticipate — and thereby accelerate — continued inflation."
The stock market scored one of its sharpest advances in history yesterday in response to reports on economic developments. The Dow-Jones industrial average soared 29.42 points and closed at 922.44.
"Before the market opened, the Chase Manhattan Bank led a round of quarter-point increases in prime lending rates, from 7 per cent to 7% per cent. Rising interest rates normally portend lower stock prices, but yesterday the market shrugged off the increases, indicating that they had come as no surprise,"
"The market’s ability to hold steady in the face of such news was interpreted as a sign of strength, and buying began to flow in."
Then the Commerce Department reported that the nation had recorded a trade surplus in April for the first time since
"September, 1971. This was a good omen for the balance of payments, and the market swung sharply higher."
"WASHINGTON, June 7 — Wholesale prices continued to increase in May at the highest peacetime rate since World War II, the Labor Department reported today."
"Both farm and industrial prices contributed to the rapid rise last month in this important indicator of inflation. Consumer prices will be affected later, though to an unknown degree."
"President Nixon met with his Cabinet, and the inflation problem was one item on the agenda ;But no actions or decisions i were announced, and the White (House said no action would be .announced before next week."
"2.1	per cent, or 2 per centj after adjustment for seasonal changes in some prices — both extraordinarily large increases !for a single month."
"WASHINGTON, June 4—Thej Senate Democratic Caucus unanimously adopted today a policy resolution calling for a ’ 90-day freeze on wages and salaries, prices, profits, rents and consumer interest rates."
"The resolution, describing Phase 3 of the Nixon Administration’s anti-inflation control program as “an unmitigated failure,"" put the Democratic majority formally on record in favor of attaching a mandatory freeze to the ""first appropriate"" legislation to come before the Senate.	. ......"
Approval of the policy statement represented an attempt by tha Senate Democrats to gain the political initiative on the inflation issue. But Republican dissatisfaction with the Administration's management of! the economy was also evident today.

I “Nineteen-sixty-six was aref-j erendum on Lyndon Johnsotv Vietnam, inflation,” observes Patrick Cadell, the Boston-based pollster for Democratic candidates in a number of midterm races this year, “though can you imagine people worrying about inflation in 1966? “Nineteen-seventy turned on issues that Richard Nixon created: ‘permissiveness,’ ‘rad-ic-libs,’ the ‘social issues.’"
"‘Someone’s Going to Pay’ “Both of those elections meant something. But I’m not sure that 1974, even with an avalanche building, will sa-y anything except what we’ve been hearing all year: ‘Someone's going to pay!’ ” Pulse-takers and candidates! alike, surveyed in dozens of! races around the country, agree j that anxiety about the economy has driven other issues out of' the public mind without giving voters a clear choice of economic remedies. Watergate scandal, in turn, has given rise to the “politics of full disclosure,” what some analysts call “the politics of character.”-On both counts, Peter D. Hart, an independent pollster, calls 1974 “the year of the disappearing issue.” At a minimum, it has proven that the familiar political handles on the public mood are not working any more."
"Some hardy perennial issues are truly gone, like Vietnam. Others, like “law and order” and “the welfare mess,” seem1 to have died of overexposure"
"Consumerism is no longer viewed as a political move ment. Environmental issues are still lively in campaigns in a few growth-torn states like Oregon and Colorado, and even more so along the path of the new coal boom, notably in North Dakota. Elsewhere, environmental protection as a popular cause has suffered in the energy shortage. Louis Harris, the pollster, reports that sample majorities favor the Alaska pipeline and, among East Coast voters, oil drilling in the Atlantic."
"ALBANY, Jan. 9—Emphasizing the “moderate, middle way,’’ Governor Wilson delivered his first message* * to the Legislature today and promised there'would be “no extravagant ventures” by the state in this time of inflation and fuel shortage."
"Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Controller Arthur Levitt and Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader.	Governor’s major proposals centered on such defensive measures as increasing unemployment and welfare aid and instituting a “little Hoover” I study to pare the state bureauc-I racy."
"ALBANY, July 17 — Governor Wilson today attributed a projected record increase in state spending to inflation but said inflation would also result in more tax revenues, so the state budget would remain balanced without tax increases."
"The increase, is $210-mlllion higher than.Mr. Wilson forecast in January. About 70 per cent of the increase, the Governor said, ""is attributable to the impact of nationwide inflation."" ■ 1974-75 predicted a growth in state revenue from all sources of $574-miIlion, but in the updated budget made available today, Mr. Wilson raised the projected growth in revenue to $823-million."
"""The substantial rise in personal incomes and spending caused by worldwide inflation,” Governor Wilson said, ""should significantly augment the state's revenues over the course of the year.""1"
"KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 15 — President Ford proposed to the nation tonight a series of voluntary measures to fight inflation and save energy. Many of his proposals, including the possible sale of Government bonds, were reminiscent of World War II programs."
"In a speech here at the annual convention of the Future Farmers of America, the President offered recommendations, ranging from planting vegetable gardens to shopping for bargains and using credit wisely, that were drawn up by his voluntary Citizens Action Committee to Fight Inflation. He also made several suggestions of his own."
"The speech was carried on national television after the three major networks originally declined to carry it ""live” on the ground that it was not newsworthy enoQfeh for such treatment. Mr. .Ford then formally asked the networks for time on the air and all three acceded. [Page 20.] series of ""WIIT’ bo/ras—WIN standing for WhipMnflation Now—as part of a program to encourage1 savings generally. ,"
"Mr. Ford said this idea came from a letter from James Kincaid, a resident of Belleville, 111., who suggested a new antiinflation Government bond purchased through payroll deductions and paying a competitive rate of interest."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 (AP) ■—Acting with -unusual speed, both the Senate and the House ' moved closer today toward creating the cost of living panel t that President Ford requested to help fight Inflation."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 3—Serious differences of opinion have emerged among the top policymakers of the Ford Administration who are trying to work out a program for simultaneously fighting inflation and reducing the nation's consumption of energy."
"Top policy advisers are also arguing over some alternative method of raising Government tax collections and over what steps to take to aid individuals and industries that are being hurt most by inflation and by actions taken to combat inflation,"
"Most of the President’s advisers, but not all, believe that some additional tax is needed because the steps they want to take to alleviate the hardships caused by inflation and by the economic slowdown would cost the Government a considerable amount of money."
"WASHINGTON, March 21—Consumer price inflation worsened again in February, but there was further evidence that the slowdown in production and employment may be"
"Led by a big jump in food prices at the grocery store, the Consumer Price Index, compiled by the Labor Department, rose 1.3 per cent last month both before and after adjustment for normal seasonal changes in some prices."
"This was the second worst monthly performance in the current inflation that began nearly 10 years ago, exceeded only by that of last August, when prices jumped after removal of the brief price freeze imposed by President Nixon."
‘Double Digit’ Inflation The February rise brought the price index to a level 10 per cent above a year earlier— the first time this nation has experienced ‘‘double digit” inflation since the Korean War 23 years ago.
"In the New York area, consumer prices rose by 1.5 per cent in February, one of the biggest monthly increases in 25 years. [Details on Page 53.]"

"WASHINGTON, March 10 — The costs of military and economic aid programs in Southeast Asia, which dropped sharply hvith the withdrawal of American forces from South Vietnam, is beginning to rise again. The increase is attributed by Administration officials to inflation and the continued fighting in South Vietnam."
"""Keeping up with the Joneses"" used to be a popular American obsession, but as inflation eats away at everyone's standard of living, the Joneses seem to be asking, ""How does anyone whose income is less than ours manage, when we can’t manage on ours?’’"
"Hardest hit by inflation has been the United States, which relatively is carrying the largest defense burden in the Western alliance. The Pentagon had been projecting a $1.7-billion increase this fiscal year in the purchasing power of the defense budget, Because of inflation, it now appears there will be a $5-billion reduction in what Pentagon planners term"
These trends emerged from a country-by-country survey by The New York Times into the impact of inflation upon the defense budgets of the major allies of the United States. The findings are supported by internal studies carried out by the Defense Department.
"Thus far, the trends do not support the gloomy projections of Pentagon officials that the North Atlantic. Treaty Organization is being driven*to “■unilateral disarmament"" by inflation. But it> is a long-term prospect that continues to haunt Pentagon officials as they contemplate the relative military efforts of the Soviet Union and the United Statps and worry that inflation and reces- sion may cause some allies to i set the Western world in late cut back.	j-1973, the prodding was partly"
"The huge increases In the price of oil are expected to produce a massive trade deficit for the Industrialized nations this year. Some preliminary figuring has be&n done by The Economist, the London weekly, which estimates that a j $36-billion increase in the cost of oil imports (after allowing for a 10 per cent reduction in the use of oil) will turn a i prospective $14.5-blllion current account surplus into a a $21.5-billion deficit"
"The only two nations expected to report a surplus, according to this reckoning, are the United States and Canada, both of whom are well-endowed with their own domestic oil supplies. The current account figures used in the calculation refer to trade in goods and services."
"The prime rate for commercial bank loans—one of the basic interest rates in the nation’s economy—moved to new high ground yesterday as the Franklin National Bank went to 11 per cent from 10'A per cent, and several California banks went to 10%."
"In recent weeks the prime rate and the galaxy of other short-term rates — such as Treasury bills, commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit—have risen rapidly. The prime rate, which is the rate that banks charge to their most credit worthy borrowers, was 8% per cent just four weeks ago. Its present general level' of 10i/2 per cent and upwardsj represents a one-month increase! of 20 per cent."

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (UPI) — Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, has urged President Nixon to do something about rising unemployment in housing and related industries and make it easier for middle-income Americans to buy homes."
"Senator Proxmire, vice chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, said the unemployment rate in the con- ! struction industry was 9.6 per cent, nearly double the national average/ and that a further increase could bring a recession."
"He said the home-construc- j tion industry was projecting only 1.6 million housing starts next year, 24 per cent less than I in 1973.	I"

"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6— Delegates to the convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations heard four possible contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination offer prescriptions today for stimulating the economy and overcoming unemployment. But the delegates, who responded with varying degrees of enthusiasm to the speakers, gave no formal indication of their preference.	i"
"The delegates reacted with frequent applause, laughter and occasional cheers to a ringing 47-minute speech by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota in which he called for a new team in the White House to take America out of the recession into a brighter future."
"without throwing people out of work,” he said. “We need a government that believes in production and jobs, not vetoes and tight money. We need an administration that is determined to get America moving again, not content to rock it to sleep.”"
"Senator Humphrey said that he would introduce legislation this week to reform the Federal Reserve System. He expressed concern about what he termed the Federal Reserve Board’s ability to “strangle economic growth with a tight money policy and high interest rates,"" and said that it was time the board was shaken up and made responsive to Congress and the people."
"The slow rate of recovery in the industrial nations from the deepest recession and highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression has finally forced the top leaders of the principal countries to take counsel together instead of relying entirely on separate measures, applied domestically."
"The economic summit meeting in Helsinki between President Ford and the heads of government of the maitt Common Market countries—Chancellor Schmidt of West Germany, President Giscard d’Estaing of France and Prime Minister Wilson of Britain—is significant as a precedent for future as well as current common action. If this method succeeds in managing the present economic crisis and the growing interdependence of the West, it will dwarf in importance the so-called European “security’* conference of 35 Western, Eastern and neutral chiefs of government that made it possible."
"Bums, recommended - today against any.permanent tax cut and' indicated that his agency would not quickly ease credit to bolster the economy."
"Democrat of Oregon, who favors a permanent tax cut, dealt with the controversial Federal Reserve policy of holding down the growth of the money supply and bank credit in an effort to damp inflation."
"“As long as I am chairman, we will not release a new wave of inflation on this country,” Dr. Bums said, rebuffing calls for drastic action."

"The city’s fiscal crisis consists of three distinct elements: a budget deficit for the fiscal year ended June 30: an even bigger budget deficit looming for the following year, and a cash-flow problem forcing the city to borrow more than a billion dollars in the next five weeks to pay its bills. Here is a look at these elements: 1074-73 BUDGET DEFICIT: Although the 1074-75 budget was adopted at SI 1.1-billion a year ago, it grew to SI 1.875-billion, the Budget Bureau says, because of rising costs, including the cost of debt service, and increases in public-assistance cases. Last fall, Mayor Beanie said that rising costs and sagging revenues were bringing about a $430-million deficit."
"12,700	employes, but because alternatives arose—union contracts were renegotiated, for instance—only 1,941 were actually laid off. Mr. Goldin adheres to his original deficit estimate. Mr. Beame has never disclosed how he intends to handle the 5120-million deficit."
"Beame estimated that, even after his announced economics and the imposition of a 10 per cent increase in the real-estate tax, the budget would still be S884-million in deficit. In April, after his budget retreat, he ‘•updated” his estimates and also announced that 3,975 employes would be laid off in agencies under his jurisdiction, and that there would have to iic an equivalent of 4,900 layoffs in the Boards of Education and Higher Education, as well as 4,900 in the Health and Hospitals Corporation."
"The House rejected today President Ford’s request to cut $1.2-biIlion more from Federal programs, and angered Republican leaders said that the projected $52-billion budget deficit could rise to $80-billion."
"Voting 371 to 17, the House approved rescissions of only $16.5-million. The President had sought a cut of $1.2-billion lin health, education, conservation and job programs in the fiscal years 1975 and 1976."

"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19—The House Ways and Means Committee gave its final approval today to a $21.3-bilIion anti-recession tax-cut bill and in the process apparently set the stage for a fight next week over repeal of the oil depletion allowance."
"- The bill would reduce the .taxes of individuals by S16.2--billion this year, half of it in rebates of 1974 taxes and half through other changes in the 'tax laws that would produce a prompt reduction in withholding rates, both mainly benefiting persons with incomes of un-,-tler $20,000."
"The measure would also reduce the taxes of businesses by $3.6-billion in 1975 and $1.6-billion in 1976, through an increase in the investment credit."
The bill calls for considerably more tax relief to individuals than the $12-billion President Ford proposed last month and only a little less than he asked for businesses.
"But it would give much of the tax reduction to individuals in a way that President Ford did not want in this quick tax-cut bill — that is, it would change the basic law and affect withholding, rather than providing only for a lump-sum rebate. It also would give much more tax relief to low and middle-income individuals and much less to upper income individuals."

"3.6	per cent last month following a drop of 3.1 per cent in December, the Federal Reserve Board reported today! The new figure on the output of the nation’s factories, mines and utilities is further confirmation that the nation is in its deepest recession since World War II."
"The one-month drop in output of 3.6 per cent has not been exceeded since a decline of 8.9 per cent in December, 1937.	The sharp recession of 1937-38 interrupted what had been the beginning of recovery from the Depression earlier in that decade."
"The steepness of last month’s decline in production stems mainly from three causes: a decline in consumer buying, particularly of “big ticket” items like automobiles; the deep slump in housing construction, and a widespread effort by business to reduce excessive inventories. As inventories are cut back, new production is reduced."
"The more quickly that inventory liquidation is completed, the sooner production is likely to turn upward again. Thus, in the view of some economists, the very steepness of the current decline may mean that it will not last long. But no one can be sure of this."
"Industrial production has dropped 9.5 per cent since Sept. 30. This four-month decline exceeded the worst four months in the 1957-58 recession,* previously the sharpest postwar slump in the economy."

"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 — Paul A. Volcker, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, agreed today with the Carter Administration that a tax cut now would be premature. But he said that when a reduction came, it should be more heavily slanted toward business than previous tax cuts, so as to promote capital investment and worker productivity."
Mr. Volcker’s comments were made at a breakfast meeting with reporters at which he also indicated that interest rates were likely to remain high as long as inflation continued at a torrid pace.
"The Fed chief said, for example, that ‘‘the money supply in the past few months has been going up faster than I would like to see it.” In recent weeks, the Fed has movefi to tighten the availability of credit but nonetheless, over the last three months, the most narrowly defined money stock has grown at a 9 percent annual rate, compared with a Fed target of P/2 to 4]/2 percent."
"“The recent trends have been on the expansionary side,” Mr. Volcker said, denying that credit had been substantially tightened. “The increase in the money supply requires some restraint which is manifested by an increase in interest rates.”"
Those reached by phone expressed great admiration for Mr. Volcker. They emphasized his broad experience in international monetary affairs as well as his recent votes on the Federal Reserve’s policy-setting Open Market Committee in support of slower monetary growth and tighter credit to reduce inflation.
"Some cautioned that, despite the vaunted economic power of the chairmanship, Mr. Volcker could not curb inflation or halt the nation’s sliding economy without support in Congress and the White House. Still, they were unified in their conviction that Mr. Volcker was an ""excellent” choice to fill what is widely regarded as the most powerful none-lected position in the Government."
"“Paul is tough and determined"" and can resist political pressures in shaping monetary policies — “which doesn’t mean he would be unaware of political realities,” Mr. Rockefeller added. Financial markets also reacted positively to the President’s choice. The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost 10 points. [Page Dl.]"
"WASHINGTON, July 16 (AP) — The number of working Americans declined slightly during the second quarter of 1979, the.first dip in employment since the 1974-75 recession, the Labor Department reported today."
The report was in line with the Carter Administration’s predictions that unemployment would rise this year arid next as the economy heads into a mild recession'..
"The Labor Department said employment totaled 96.4 million people during the April-June quarter, down from 96.6 million during the first three months of the year."
"The last time employment fell was in the first quarter of 1975, when the number of working Americans dropped to 84.4 million from 85.6 million in the last quarter of 1974."
"The percentage of Americans who are 16 or older and hold jobs also declined slightly during the second quarter, to 59.1 percent, compared to a record 59.4 percent during the first quarter."
"The Administration's guidelines for wages and prices are fading fast from the larger program to arrest inflation, essentially for three reasons:"
"The Administration's guidelines for wages and prices are fading fast from the larger program to arrest inflation, essentially for three reasons: •	President Carter and his lieutenants have not made good use of the White House bully pulpit to win compliance and have left the public unpersuaded about their importance."
•	They have had bad luck. Inflation is running at nearly 14 percent a year—far above the levels contemplated when the guidelines were drawn last fall. Resistance to and evasion of the guidelines have grown as workers and their employers increasingly perceive them to have been unrealistic.
"WASHINGTON, March * - Initial wage and price demands by ihe International Brotherhood of Teamsters in contract talks with the trucking industry substantially exceed President Garter's anti-inflation guidelines, sources close to the negotiators said today."
The President’s anti-inflation program includes a voluntary standard aimed at limiting wage and benefit increases to 7 percent a year.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 — A new proposal to combat inflation, a constitutional amendment that would tie increases in Government spending to the nation’s economic growth, was unveiled today by a committee of relatively conservative businessmen and economists as an alternative to requiring a balanced Federal budget."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (AP) — Worker productivity, a key influence on the nation’s inflation rate and living standard, grew by a mere 0.4 percent in 1978, the smallest rise since the 1974 recession, the Government said today."
"The latest figures, released by the Labor Department, cast new doubt on the Carter Administration’s ability to slow inflation this year. “Certainly, the poor productivity gain will contribute further to inflation,” said one Administration economist."
"In his Economic Message to Congress yesterday, President Carter attributed much of the nation’s economic problem to the declining productivity of American workers, businesses and governments. The President also warned that a continued sluggish productivity growth rate was hampering the country’s ability to create new jobs and provide a higher standard of living. A Measure of Efficiency"
The first major national survey since the President disclosed his budget last week showed that two out of three Americans thought a cut in Federal spending was more important than a cut in taxes and that three out of five believed that spending reductions would be a major step in curbing rising prices.
"Despite Mr. Carter’s commitment to a balanced Federal budget, only one respondent in five believed he could achieve that goal within the next few years. Instead, the respondents overwhelmingly backed a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget ""except in times of emergency.” Seventy-three percent supported this view and 16 percent were opposed."
"PARIS — The one unmistakable and unavoidable thing for an American visiting Western Europe these days is the inflation. We complain about high prices in the United States, but over here they make even the Fifth Avenue stores in New York seem like bargain-basement cheapskates."
"When a state like New Jersey maintains ceilings below the national level, the state’s institutions cease lending within the state, placing as much of their funds as allowed by law in out-of-state investments, where a higher interest rate is available."
"WASHINGTON, March 5 — Acknowledging that he was out of step with his party as well as with Congress, Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill Jr. disagreed today with President Carter’s objective of balancing the budget, calling it a symbolic gesture that would have little effect on inflation."
"The atmosphere was described by Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, who emerged from a meeting of the Democratic caucus to observe: “We are on the verge of a financial crisis, if we’re not already in it. The real danger is an international financial panic.”"
"The board’s proposal, now subject to public comment, is intended to make banking in the United States more competitive with banking in London, Hong Kong and other foreign financial centers."

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 — In its annual Economic Report to Congress, the Carter Administration today depicted the economic outlook as bleak, forecasting persistent Inflation and lower growth over at least the next two years."
"This year’s Economic Report of the President offered no new ideas for dealing with the nation’s economic difficulties, and the report frankly conceded that the Administration was perplexed about “The performance of the economy has made the economic outlook for 1980 and 1981 particularly difficult to fathom,’’ Charles L. Schult2e, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said at a briefing yesterday."
"Today’s inch-thick analysis — most of which was the Council of Economic Advisers’ report, preceded by the President’s message — was particularly gloomy for an Administration projection. On Saturday, Mr. Schultze said that it was the first time that an Administration had issued a forecast of a recession."
"9The nation’s gross national product is expected to drop 1 percent this year, adjusted for inflation, as the economy experiences a mild recession; consumer prices are likely to rise 10.4 percent, and unemployment to climb to 7.5 percent."
"WASHINGTON, March 3 — The Administration’s new anti-innation effort emerged today, in the view of senior economic officials, as likely to call for spending reductions of about $4 billion in the current fiscal year and about $15 billion next year in an attempt to balance the fiscal year 1981 budget."
"However, the officials have concluded that they will be unable to balance the 1981 budget through cutbacks unless a new economic forecast being prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers projects a smaller deficit than the current forecasts."
"In addition, the senior economic officials have ruled out any use of credit control powers to put fixed limits on the amount of credit that could be extended or to reduce credit in the depressed automobile and housing areas."
"BOSTON — The eyes of the middle-aged blond woman behind the desk at the unemployment office narrow as she looks out to the line that is curved like a dollar sign across the room. It has been like this all morning, new claims turn ing up like bruised berries in a late bushel. She will get no coffee break today."
"We feel uncomfortable standing here, some of us dressed up for the job parade, some of us in the sweat shirts and worn-down heels of the aimless unemployed. Cigarettes and matches protrude among us like little flags of tension; eyes shift away from even momentary meetings. We case each other on the sly, telling ourselves that we do not belong to this group, we have never had to stand in this line before, we do not really have to stand here now except that our friends have urged us to."
"URBANA, 111. — Unprecedented inflation, rising unemployment and crippling interest rates continue as the economy hurdles into severe recession. One esoteric remedy after another has been tried with little, if any, improvement. Yet one of the most important actions has been used only timidly, at best. That is the need for a bold large-scale program to stimulate home buying. Without a stepped up home-building pace, the nation cannot regain its healthy growth curve."
"In 1979, the 1.73 million new housing starts contributed directly and indirectly over $200 billion to the economy, or about 8.5 percent of the gross national product. The housing industry furnished 2.5 million jobs and produced $5 billion in Federal income tax, more than three-quarters of a billion dollars in state income tax, and $2 billion dollars in local real estate taxes."
"Just a few weeks ago, 1980 housing starts were projected at 1.1 million units. Now indications point to fewer than one million, or about one-half the 1979 level. This precipitous slide is throwing more than a million people out of work and cutting Federal in-"

"With mortgage-interest rates in the 14 percent range, a $65,000 home requiring a 5 percent payment, payable over a 30-year period, is within the reach of 4.5 million families. If the Government were to sponsor a subsidized program reducing interest rates to 8 percent, then 12.5 million families would become eligible to buy houses."
"Fears about the economy, especially rising unemployment, appear to be hardening divisive attitudes among population groups in the nation, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll."
The poll showed that the widely reported antipathy toward the Cuban refugees had solid roots in the declining economy and was strong among whites with recent experience or present fear of joblessness.
"It also showed that the white Americans most troubled by the economy — whose numbers are growing — were more likely than those who reported more satisfaction with their economic situation to minimize the extent of black unemployment and to attribute it to an unwillingness to work, rather than to a general shortage of jobs or a lack of necessary skills."
"The growing concern over unemployment was reflected in the fact that 31 percent of the 1,517 adults interviewed across the nation by telephone between last Wednesday and Sunday said that it was a more important problem than inflation, up from 19 percent in a mid-April poll. Fifty percent said inflation was more important."

"In late April, the stock market reached its highest level in more than eight years. Signs were that the prolonged period of high interest rates was finally easing, and enthusiasm for the Reagan Administration’s budget and tax proposals fed a new mood of optimism on Wall Street."
"Since reaching that peak of 1,024.05, the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest and best-known gauge of stock trends, has fallen almost 125 points. And just as investors and analysts generally credited the Reagan Administration for the April surge in stock prices, they are holding it responsible for much of the decline."
"Stock prices were sharply lower in early trading yesterday but the market recovered later as investors sought shares at bargain prices. [PageDl.] “Wall Street likes to see results and the Reagan Administration has got a major problem with credibility,” William M. Le Fevre, a vice president at Purcell, Graham & Company, said yesterday. “The question is no longer whether the Administration can balance the budget — it's now doubtful that a balanced budget could be achieved by 1984 — but whether the whole supply-side concept will ultimately work. ”"
"burst of business activity that will produce enough new taxable income to more than offset the tax reductions. Wall Street has refused to embrace economic projections based on this assumption. The slide in the stock market, analysts say, is a sign that many investors have given up hope for any relief from high interest rates in the near future. The expectation of large Federal deficits and heavy borrowing by the Treasury at a time when the Federal Reserve Board continues to restrict the flow of money and keep interest rates high in its effort to fight inflation has created fears on Wall Street that the economy may be in for a long slowdown."
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 — Three indexes that measure prices at various levels of production indicated a continued easing of inflation during October."
"The Producer Price Index, which applies to finished goods and is a rough measure of the lever of inflation that consumers will face in coming months, inched up by six-tenths of 1 percent in October from September, the Labor Department reported today."
Two companion price indexes — the one for materials at the intermediate stage of production and the one for crude goods — more directly reflected diminished inflationary pressures.
"City, nearly three times the national increase of 6 percent and more than double the suburban increase of 8 percent. Unemployment remained higher than the nationwide average, but the final 1980 figures released Friday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that New York City’s increase was small compared with the national increase."
"‘‘In the last two recessions, ’68-70 and ’73-75, when the country caught a cold, we caught pneumonia,” said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the bureau. ""This time the country got a cold and we have the sniffles.” “Is New York becoming recession-proof?” asked Karen Gerard, chief metropolitan economist for the Chase Manhattan Bank. While all the data are not in, she noted that the city’s services orientation did indeed offer a degree of recession protection, especially in the recent downturn, which was primarily in the auto and construction industries."
"The demand for office space, shops and apartments remained strong despite rapidly rising rents. The number of foreign tourists was up 475,000, or 22 percent, from 1979, which was the best year on record at the time, and each tourist spent an average of more than $400 in the city."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (AP) — The Government reported today that extended unemployment benefits were being halted for jobless workers in 25 states, including New York and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands."
The Labor Department said that the number of people drawing unemployment insurance in those states and territories dropped below the 4.5 percent level at which 13 weeks of benefit payments is authoritzed on top of the basic 26-week unemployment compensation period.
because the percentage of jobless workers drawing unemployment in the affected states is below both the 4 percent state and 4.5 percent national levels.

"DETROIT, Mich., March 22 — Moral Majority, President Reagan’s economic recovery plan and the political coattails of David A. Stockman will be tested Tuesday in a Congressional primary election in southwestern Michigan."
"Nowhere in the 228,000-student system have the shocks of Michigan’s economic decline been more keenly felt than here on the campus of the State University of Michigan, where the institution’s president, M. Cecil Mackey, is faced with a need to cut more than $29 million from his own deficit-ridden budget this year. His board of trustees are to vote in two weeks on his proposals to eliminate the School of Nursing entirely, along with the Department of Humanities, drastically reduce the veterinarian program, and effect lesser cuts in all other departments of the campus."
"Altogether, more than 70 teachers, half of them tenured, would lose their jobs along with hundreds of employees in clerical and administrative positions at M.S.U."
"The proposed cuts have made life hard for Dr. Mackey. He spent four hours Friday morning listening to criticism of his plans from students and faculty members at an open hearing on the proposed cuts, and Friday afternoon he was in Ingham County Court defending his plans against a faculty lawsuit charging that they violate tenure laws. More suits, particularly from nursing students facing displacement to other campuses, are expected to follow."
"EUGENE, Ore., Dec. 6 — A recession that began with the collapse of the lumber and new housing markets in early 1980 has forced Oregon officials into an almost frenetic search for ways to cut back on a budget that has already been pruned."
"Governor Atiyeh, a Republican, has called the Legislature into session beginning Jan. 11. Mindful that three quarters of Oregon’s financing comes from income taxes, he and the Democratic leaders of both houses have said a tax increase is to be avoided. Some legislators may try once again to get “I don’t believe a sales tax is politically saleable here now,” said Terry Mattock, executive director of Oregon Tax Research, a nonprofit organization dedicated to holding down taxes."
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 — Reagan Administration officials said today that new preliminary estimates show the Federal budget deficit climbing to a record $109 billion in the 1982 fiscal year."
"i ne estimates aiso project deficits oi $152 billion in the 1983 fiscal year and $162 billion in the 1984 fiscal year, without spending cuts or tax increases beyond what the Administration has already proposed. In his election campaign, President Reagan had said he would eliminate the deficit by 1984."
The $109 billion figure for 1982 is more than twice the $43.1 billion the Administration had forecast in September and substantially higher than the $80 billion talked about in the Administration and Congress until a few days ago.
"The new deficit projection for the 1982 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, is a product, officials contend, of the deepening recession, which has cut tax revenues and increased some spending for social programs, such as unemployment insurance."
"Spread over a year, such a monthly increase would add up to an annual inflation rate of only 4.8 percent, not compounded. That was a welcome slowdown from the pace of more than 10 percent in the summer months and economists said they expected the index to continue to show small rises for several more months."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 — Bowing to Congressional opposition, White House officials agreed today to trim by more than half the $13 billion package of new budget cuts proposed for the 1982 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. At the same time President Reagan said the nation's economy was in a ""slight” recession."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 — The recession that President Reagan has said is under way will likely drive unemployment to a rate of more than 8 percent this winter, an Administration economist predicted today."
"Yesterday, President Reagan said that the economy was in a recession. It was the first such acknowledgement from the Administration."
"The prospect of many more jobless workers, together with the possibility of lower tax revenues and a higher Federal deficit, will likely complicate and intensify the debate in Congress over how much to cut nonmilitary spending."
"Liberal Democrats and moderate Republicans may well argue that cutting spending would make the recession worse. If revenues appear to be falling well short of the Administration’s forecast, those who want to preserve income maintenance, health, nutrition and other nondefense programs may argue that spending cuts are pointless because a large deficit is inevitable in any event."
lock in 16 Percent interest! we’re better Than the Money Market Funds! The latest advertising blitz by savings banks and savings and loans should bring cheer to inflation-battered savers. But savings industry executives aren’t smiling. High interest rates are pushing hundreds of so-called “thrift” institutions toward insolvency. Their best hope now — other than a sharp drop in interest rates — is legislation to give Federal regulators broad powers to arrange mergers with commercial banks.
"Thrifts compete directly with commercial banks for depositors’ savings. Yet, unlike ordinary banks, they have been legally obliged to channel most of the funds into housing mortgages. Such specialization worked in an era of stable prices. But it left the thrifts extremely vulnerable to rapid increases in interest rates."
"New housing loans carry higher interest rates, of course. And almost all allow the lender to adjust the rates in future years. But it will take many years for the thrifts to work off their old, unprofitable loans. Unless market interest rates fall dramatically in the next few years, a lot of them are going to have trouble paying their bills."
"WASHINGTON, April 20 — House members returning to Washington today from the Easter recess brought a message from the voters back home: Find a budget compromise that will reduce the deficits projected by President Reagan’s plan and provide some relief from high interest rates."
"According to the lawmakers, the support for these modifications reflects a loss of confidence in the President’s | original economic recovery program. “People are starting to lose patience,” said Representative James A. Courier, a conservative Republican from northern New Jersey, continuing, “not totally, but to some degree. ”"
"WASHINGTON, April 15 — The nation’s industrial output fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in March, further confirming that the recession is not over yet, the Federal Reserve Board reported today."
"Before the March figures were released, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said that the economy was “dead in the water.” Emphasizing the importance of the current budget negotiations with Congress, Mr. Regan said a compromise was needed to cut the Federal deficit and bring interest rates down so the economy can revive."
"The March decline in industrial production, which measures the output of the nation’s factories, mines and electric utilities, follows a 1.2 percent increase in February and a 2 percent decline in January. Economists have said that the rise in February was just a rebound from the sharp decline in the first month of the year induced by bad weather and not a sign of an economic rebound."
"For the first quarter of the year, the industrial production index is down 3.3 percent, which Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department’s chief economist, said is in line with predictions of a 4 percent to 5 percent decline, at an annual rate, in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation."
"“We’re in a very steep recession at this point, and the economy is dead in the water,” Secretary Regan said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” ""It’s not going anywhere. It's not going down much. It’s not going up any. It’s just dead and something has to move it to drive it.” ""If Congress steps forward with the President and says, ’O.K., we are going to do something about it,’ that’s the signal the market wants, ’ ’ Mr. Regan said. “Then interest rates start down. Then business starts to revive. ’ ’"
Bankers and savings executives say variable-rate mortgages are necessary for home financing because of volatile economic conditions. They say the fixed-
"Many thrift units have reported losses in the last year because they have had to pay interest rates as high as 15 percent on some new deposits, while being repaid for older home loans at cates as low as 6 percent.The variable mortgages are intended to give the lender more flexibility by letting income from mortgage loans keep pace with the interest rates paid on deposits."
"WASHINGTON, July 7—The Reagan Administration sought today to dissuade the Federal Reserve Board from provoking a sharp rise in interest rates, which could slow the economy’s lively recovery."
"WASHINGTON, March 16 — Industrial production climbed 1.6 percent in February from the January level, the first increase in the output of the nation’s factories since the recession started last July, the Government reported today."
"Shift of Movement Seen “The mild upturn in industrial production in February is cause for qualified optimism,” said Jerry J. Jasinow-ski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. “Indications of an emerging turnaround in industry suggest that the decline in economic activity will end in April or May.”"
"William A. Brown, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said that “the rate of decline has slowed.” The economy, he added, is now “moving sideways. ’ ’"
"The rate of inflation for all of 1982 is now likely to be 5 percent or lower, far less than the double-digit increases of 1979 and 1980."
"With just a week to go before the Congressional elections, the announcement of last month’s Consumer Price Index by the Labor Department buttressed a campaign claim that President Reagan i had been making for months — that the Administration has all but licked inflation and set the stage for an economic recovery."
"But the Democrats have countered that the price of lower inflation is a se-vere recession and 10.1 percent unemployment, the highest rate since 1940. They, as well as some economists, also argue that the outlook for recovery is still uncertain."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — It has long been assumed, at least in political debate, that full employment in the United States is reached when the jobless rate falls to roughly 4 percent."
"Recently, however, the Reagan Administration has begun to assert that long-term shifts in the labor force have substantially raised the “natural” rate of unemployment. The natural rate, the minimum amount of unemployment consistent with stable prices, has now reached 6 to 6V4 percent, Administration officials have maintained, adding that today’s politically explosive jobless figure of 10.1 percent should therefore be judged by that more lenient standard."
"But the fact is, many economists say, that the President and Secretary Regan are quite right; the natural rate has indeed climbed."
"A senior New York State official said yesterday that state tax collections were falling sharply because of the recession. Unless new taxes are enacted by the Legislature, he said, the state could end the fiscal year with a deficit of more than half a billion dollars."
"The official said that new data on collections during the first six months of the year had shown a sharp drop in receipts from personal income, and sales and business taxes. As a result, he said, revenues for the year are expected to decline by between $200 million and $300 million beyond previous estimates."
The administration official said the new shortfall in revenues would bring the deficit to over $500 million and demonstrate the need for new tax measures.
"The Dow average broke the 1,000 mark on several occasions during the first six months of the Reagan Administration, going as high as 1,024.05 on April 27, 1981. But it is a barrier that often convinces investors to sell and as a result, it has seldom remained above 138.5	million shares, the second highest ever. The record was set last Thursday, when 147.1 million shares changed hands."
"OMAHA, Oct. 21 — President Reagan, stepping up his appeals for patience in economically depressed farm communities, charged today that “voices of fear and doom” in the Democratic Party were threatening the chances of economic recovery."
"“There is a psychological element to a recession,” Mr. Reagan told 8,000 applauding listeners at a rally supporting the re-election of Gov. Charles Thone. “You have to ask of those critics in an election year: Do they really want a recovery? Or would they be smiling broadly if things were getting worse simply because it might seem politically advantageous to them?”"
"The audience shook the Omaha Civic Center with cheers and yells at Mr. Reagan’s attempt to throw the onus of the recession back onto the Democrats. Outside the Civic Center, about 200 people protested Mr. Reagan’s economic policies and called for a freeze on the buildup of nuclear weapons."
At one point in his talk the President mixed near-religious fervor with his economic message in a state that his aides acknowledge is gripped with anxiety because of plunging farm prices and income.
"“There is a passage in the Psalms which says, ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,’ ” Mr. Reagan said. “America has endured a long terrible night of economic hardship. But now we are seeing the first welcome bursts of sunshine, the dawning of a new day for our country. ”"
"He was also critical of the promises, many of them made in the selling of the Reagan economic program in 1981, that inflation could be cut painlessly."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 (AP) — The country’s municipal leaders protested President Reagan's proposed budget deficit and program cuts today, but the President and the Vice President advised them to bear the pain."
"Mr. Bush said at the league’s annual winter meeting that the Administration was determined to press on with Mr. Reagan’s economic recovery program ""to make the financial base of this nation sound again, for in the final analysis, that is the only way to give states and municipalities the resources to serve the people.”"
"Alfred Kahn’s Jan. 4 Op-Ed article, “Trade-Off on Inflation.” implies that rising joblessness and falling wage levels are a realistic trade-off for an inflation that stems from specific sectoral price increases in energy, housing and food. He admits that ""wage increases did not contribute significantly to any of these price rises,” but that does not dissuade him from calling for wage restraint as the solution to an inflation that is basically sectoral and obviously cannot be blamed on excess demand or an overheated economy."
"Interest rates declined yesterday, cheering a depressed stock market and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 13.51 points, matching its best gain in more than four months."
"The nation’s banks cut the prime interest rate a half-point, to 15 percent, the lowest level in more than two years."
"Credit markets staged a strong rally, with rates on three-month Treasury bills at the weekly auction dropping below 10 percent for the first time in two years. The rate was 13.25 percent as recently as late June."
"The lower rates were spurred by a cut Friday in the Federal Reserve’s discount rate to 11 percent from 11*£ percent. The rate represents the interest charged on loans by the Federal Reserve to member banks, and the cut reflected efforts by the Federal Reserve to encourage interest rate declines and stimulate the economy."
"The reduction in the prime rate followed the lead of the Mellon Bank of | Pittsburgh on Friday. The banks were able to cut the rate, which is used as a basis for many interest charges on short-term loans, because of the decline i in the cost of funds they borrow."
"WASHINGTON, July 28 — President Reagan cautioned tonight that recovery from the recession “is going to be slow,” and he charged that Congressional inaction on his budget cuts had “held back the psychology” that is needed for the economy to grow."
"With some asperity, Mr. Reagan also vowed to seek more spending cuts and denied that he had been hypocritical, as Democrats have charged, in advocating a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget when his Administration’s deficits were at record levels."
"“I don’t feel self-conscious at all,” he said. He said deficits would be lower if Democrats had “given us all that we asked for last year and this in reductions in Government spending.” His voice rising, he added:"
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 — American businesses, faced with a sluggish economy and high interest rates, have continued to cut their plans for expansion and modernization, the Commerce Department reported today."
"The continued reduction in planned business investment, which is crucial to the hopes for a long-term economic recovery, has continued all through 1982, despite the huge “supply-side” tax cut that the Reagan Administration won for business last year. The President pinned his promises for a strong economic recovery on a resulting increase in capital investment. Now Administration officials are conceding that the principal hope for recovery rests with consumers."
"This would be the first decline in real, or inflation-adjusted, capital spending since 1975, though in 1980 and 1981 investment was basically flat."
"A late rally enabled the stock market to post a moderate gain yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest closing level in more than a year."
"The industrial average, which was off 2.20 points at 2:30 P.M., closed 7.45 points higher, at 930.46. Analysts said the upsurge resulted mostly from increased institutional buying."
"The industrial average yesterday finished at its best point since Aug. 14, 1981, when it ended at 936.93. Of the 30 components in the Dow average, 22 advanced and only 5 declined, a sign of dominance by cash-rich institutions. The other three stocks closed unchanged."
"In the overall market, advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered stocks that fell in price by 980 to 553. Turnover dropped to 69.7 million shares from “The present bull market, which has seen the Dow soar about 150 points in the last month, should continue for the next several weeks,” said Charles"
"Howard Silverman, managing partner of Gruntal & Company, said the Dow could reach the 990 mark by the end of the month “as many of the money managers and investors who missed the current market advance begin taking positions.”"
"With most companies hunkered down for a long recession, times are tough for the machine tool industry. But that doesn’t excuse the attempt of one American toolmaker to seek refuge from Japanese competition in American tax laws."
"The World Economy Is in Serious Trouble, And the GATT Parley Offers an Opportunity To Develop Remedies"
"The world economy is facing the most serious threat to its cohesion and prosperity in the postwar period. Inflation, recession, high unemployment and extraordinary trade and financial pressures are placing the principles and institutions of international economic cooperation under enormous stress."
"Why are so many economic difficulties coming together all at once? The major reason is that many countries are paying the price for not adequately addressing economic problems during the 1970’s. Because they did not achieve sustained reductions in inflation in that decade, a number of governments have been forced to take painful corrective action — tighter budgets, for example, and higher interest rates. These policies, in turn, have led to simultaneous recessions in the industrialized world, and, by weakening markets for exports from the third world, have added to developing countries’ debt problems. The net result has been a mutually reinforcing contraction of world trade and growth."
"This contraction in turn contributes to, and is made worse by, demands for new subsidies and import restrictions —	in some cases to protect sensitive industries from foreign competition, in others to reduce trade deficits and thus control foreign debt. Whatever the reason, any country whose economy depends in some degree on exports is hurt."
"WASHINGTON, April 29 — President Reagan tonight accused the Democratic leaders in Congress of advocating “more and more spending and more and more taxes’’ and asked the American people to support a budgetary approach that would rely on spending cuts to close the Federal deficit in the years ahead."
"not nearly as devastating as those of the Great Depression, when the United States’ gross national product plunged 30 percent in real terms between 1929 and 1933, a quarter of the labor force was out of work and prices collapsed. For the developed economies of the where countries are not in economic difficulty,” says George W. Ball, Under Secretary of State in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations and now a consultant to Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. “The Soviet Union and Communist countries are in desperate trouble, and in the West it is hard to find a bright spot.”"
"PARIS, Jan. 16 — Attempts to solve the international debt crisis will fail and the world recession will worsen unless other Western nations and Japan join the United States in getting their economies moving again, a senior American policymaker warned today."
The White House has chimed in with blunt but confusing advice; Don’t let interest rates rise but do slow down the growth of the money supply. It’s hard to do one without the other. What the Reagan Administration refuses to acknowledge is how it helped to create this dilemma with policies that produced huge budget deficits but no agreed plan with Congress for reducing them.
"Interest rates are creeping up, at least in part because the Fed has been trying to hold down the money supply. The issues now are how much restraint and whether to impose it by raising the discount rate. That is the rate banks pay when they bor- row to build required reserves. Increasing the rate would be formal notice that the Fed again fears inflation more than it fears slower growth."
"Any action that raises interest rates would have undesirable consequences. It might hurt the recovery. It would surely worsen the world debt problem. Poorer countries are barely keeping up with present interest payments on their debts. They would be doubly hint if America’s recovery slackens and slows down their export sales. Higher interest rates would also make the dollar stronger than it already Is, and retard America’s own sales abroad."
"If the change had been in effect in November, the jobless rate might have been two-tenths of a percentage point lower than the 10.8 percent reported."
"WASHINGTON, April 18 (UPI) — Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said today that the startlingly high unemployment rate among black teen-agers was the result of lack of skills and lack of hope."
"In testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Dr. Norwood called the situation “one of the most important social problems we have.”"
"In March, the unemployment rate for black teen-agers was 45 percent, as against 23.2 percent for all 16-to-19-year-olds. For young adults 20 to 24, the rate was 14.9 percent."
"Dr. Norwood said black teen-agers have faced special problems since the mid-1950’s, when unemployment rates were roughly the same for black and white youngsters."
"""Since then, however, black unemployment rates have risen much faster than for whites,” Dr. Norwood said. “Even more disconcerting is the labor force participation of black teen-agers."
"BAL HARBOUR. Fla., Feb. 21 — Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said today that if unemployment continued at the “intolerable” rate of 9 or 10 percent there could be no sustained recovery this year or next."
"Only a large-scale job creation program, started as soon as possible, can check the current recession, he said."
"Mr. Kirkland spoke as the executive council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations opened its annual winter meeting here. The council called for the Federal Government to add $22.5 billion to its spending for the current fiscal year for public works and construction programs that the labor leaders said could put 900,000 people back to work. They also called for $46 billion in job spending in the fiscal year 1984, which begins Oct. 1."
The amount called for in 1983 would be five times the $4.3 billion supplemen-: tal appropriation President Reagan and Congressional leaders have agreed on r for employment stimulation and reces-j sion relief this year; chances that the I A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s proposal would be ; enacted appeared extremely slim.
"While continuing its traditional sup-' port for military spending, the execu-, tive council called for a slower rate of increase. It said it believed the nation’s security could be assured with a 5 to 7 percent annual rise in these expenditures instead of the 10 percent President Reagan is advocating."
The most graphic testimony to economic recovery was the stores crowded with Christmas shoppers. And the season’s overflowing materialism suggests that the election year1 now fatefully upon us may turn primarily on issues of foreign policy and national security.
"Meanwhile, the bleak economic atmosphere that dominated the 1982 Congressional elections has disappeared; all indicators are moving in the right direction; and the best forecasts — though even economists concede that their predictions are written in sand — are for a recovery lasting at least until Election Day."
"Thomas O’Brien, financial vice president at Harvard, said the loans would carry interest rates of 14 or 15 percent."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 — Senator Bob Dole, arguing that the economic recovery was being jeopardized, said today that Congress had put spending “on automatic pilot” and charged that President Reagan has failed to provide sufficient leadership in reducing the budget deficit."
"“Just as Congress must put spending in order, the President must make clear his priorities on the budget, and tell us what he expects us to do about the deficit,” Mr. Dole, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a major address on the Senate floor."
"Later, in an interview. Senator Dole said his remarks had been aimed at prompting Mr. Reagan to lead a joint effort with Congress to deal with the deficit by decreasing spending and raising taxes."
"WASHINGTON, May 6 (AP) — A rare gain in American exports helped chop the nation’s merchandise trade deficit by nearly one-third in the first quarter of 1983, the Government said today. A big drop in oil imports contributed to the improvement."
"In all, the deficit for United States foreign trade in manufactured goods, farm produce, oil and other merchandise narrowed to $8.4 billion in the January-March period from $12.1 billion in the last three months of 1982, the Commerce Department said."
"The new report runs basically parallel to monthly Commerce Department figures, but excludes military trade and computes shipping charges in a more favorable way."
"The new version said total American exports increased $1.9 billion, or 4 percent, to a total of $50 billion in the first three months of the year, the first quarterly increase in two years. Exports were still 18 percent below their"
"Helping push overall exports up were Increased wheat sales to the Soviet Union and developing countries, rising sales of civilian aircraft and increasing exports of automotive products to Canada, the report said."
A comeback for new construction of unsubsidized rental housing nationally has been widely predicted by real estate analysts in the wake of the decline in interest rates and the move toward greater stability in the inflation rate.
"Nevertheless, developers are conscious of the demand for rental housing. Now a new governmental action has given added reason to predict an upturn in rental construction. This is the recent increase in the mortgage limits that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to insure in new unsubsidized multifamily rentals and cooperatives."
"Although many analysts expect that interest rates might fall later this year, such forecasts have not been enough to raise prices and reduce yields of Treasury securities in recent days. The price of the closely watched 10% percent bonds due in 2012, for example, fell more than half a point yesterday, to an offering price of 98 18/32 and a yield of 10.53 percent. Late last week, the long-term Treasury bond was traded close to its peak price of 100(4 set early last November."
"Amid light trading activity, market participants said that prices were pushed lower by some securities firms whose sales were triggered by the pattern of trading in the futures market, where the price of the June bond contract fell to 77 11/32, down 13/32."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 — President Reagan, declaring that bipartisan cooperation in Congress had already helped arrest the nation’s “long decline,” appealed to Republicans and Democrats tonight to join in a new attempt to reduce the projected Federal deficit by $100 billion in the next three years."
"“There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land,” Mr. Reagan declared. “America is back — standing tall, looking to the 80’s with courage, confidence and hope.”"
"The governors’ panel also urged a reduction in spending, a freeze on cost-of-living increases for Federal employees and a cutback in military spending."
"The resolution was approved despite a speech earlier today by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, who argued that the military budget reflected the Administration’s assessment of national security needs. Mr. Weinberger said the military budget was not a factor in the high deficits and predicted that military spending could decline in a couple of years, once “modernization” had been achieved."
"MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 12 — Walter F. Mondale greeted President Reagan’s statement on taxes today with renewed demands that Mr. Reagan disclose his plans for reducing the Federal budget deficit by specifying which programs would be cut and what taxes would be raised if he was elected to a second term."
"Mr. Mondale has made the budget deficit and taxes major issues in his campaign, and Mr. Duncan’s words seemed to indicate that the former Vice President would continue to try to portray Mr. Reagan as a friend of the rich and himself as the friend of the average wage earner."
The Democrats’ statement accused Mr. Reagan of being “either unwilling or unable to put America’s financial house in order.”
"“The Republican Party believes spending should be cut before taxes are raised,"" the statement reads. “President Reagan will raise taxes as a last resort; Mr. Mondale can’t wait to.” In a brief address by telephone from his ranch in California, the President referred to the need to reduce the deficit, adding, “We now estimate the deficit to be well below that which was projected last February.”"
"Imports, driven by the nation's expanding economy and the continued exceptional strength of the dollar, rose 6.1 percent, to $29.7 billion, while exports fell 1.1 percent, to $17.5 billion."
"The latest figures, analysts said, showed that American competitiveness in world markets continues to : worsen, damaging exporters and cur-. tailing employment opportunities. If the trend of the first four months of 1984 continued, the full-year trade deficit ■would be $126 billion, or 81 percent more than the record 1983 level of $69.4 billion."
"When America’s interest rates rise one percentage point, the added annual cost to third-world borrowers is nearly $4 billion. The rates have risen more than a point in two months, and may go higher. It’s a new phase of the world debt crisis, posing a particular dilemma for the United States, which thus appears to be profiting from the troubles of the poorest nations."
"This enrages the nations whose interest payments already eat up all their foreign trade earnings. Why, they ask, should they have to tighten belts even more to underwrite America’s prosperity? It’s “madness,” says President Alfonsin of Argentina. Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker is equally though less pungently concerned. President Reagan’s budget deficits have forced the Fed to tighten its hold on credit, even though it knows that this threatens the debtor nations’ recovery and may force them to choose between political turmoil and default."
"Any such relief, of course, would impose at least a temporary cost on someone else. Mr. Volcker and Mr. Solomon are in effect lobbying to have the world’s commercial banks pay it — with varied accounting schemes to mitigate the pain. The banks’ benefit would be greater certainty that the debtors can eventually work their way back to prosperity while the Fed can more rationally control credit to resist inflation in the United States."
"When the stock market surged, however, many fund managers were able to quickly reverse course — without unloading bonds — thanks to spreading operations involving Treasury bond options, as well as by using the bond futures also traded on the Chicago Board of Trade."
"While the use of bond futures to hedge positions in the fixed-income securities market is old hat, options spreading is more practical for both hedging and, equally important to bond investors, profitably controlling the volatility factor in this market."
"Basically, a spread involves the simultaneous buying of equal amounts of calls and puts in the options market. Calls give investors the right to buy the underlying securities at a specified price within a fixed period of time. Puts are the right to sell them under the same conditions. The cost of the options, or rights, is termed the premium. In either case, investors need not exercise the rights if they become unprofitable."
"“But spreads are not just for hedgers, or those who can’t make up their mind about which way the bond market will go,” said Jack A. Barbanel, first vice president and director of futures and options trading at Gruntal & Company. “Spreads also can be used profitably by investors willing to take a stand in the market."""
"Friedman fails to consider the inordinate market power that large firms and large unions assert, or the political clout of certain industries, or the skyrocketing oil prices of the 1970’s, or today’s huge Federal deficits, which are distorting credit markets. To him, it is beyond the grasp of government to deal with such complexities, and his proof is the failure of one Administration’s inept wage and price controls."

"ALBANY, Feb. 6—The State* Comptroller, Arthur Levitt, an-j nounced today that the former1 president of the World Bank and the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board would participate in a panel to “verify and support” the state’s credit-worthiness in an effort to help it regain access to the borrowing markets in the spring."
The setting up of the panel was seen by fiscal officials here as a significant development in the state’s attempts to extricate itself from its financial emergency.
"Whether their assistance will be enough to help the state was in doubt ""this afternoon, when Mr. Levitt’s announcement was made. Bankers across* the country have been expressing doubt that the state would be able to borrow, in the public marketplace, all of the S4 billion it needs to keep its operations going and to advance needed funds to counties, cities and school districts across the state."
"TRENTON, Jan. 20—Barring an economic miracle. New Jersey will have to borrow S300 million more from the Federal Government in the. next year or so to pay state unemployment benefits. Labor and Industry Commissioner Joseph A. Hoffman said today. This would bripg the state’s debt in this areja to more than $700 million."
"The state long ago bankrupted its unemploynient-bene-fits fund, he said, and has been borrowing more than $30 million a month from Washington."
"Repaying the loans under the present Federal regulations could stifle New Jersey's economic recovery for years, said Mr. Hoffman, who has been pushing a program to change these regulations."
"“The only thing going for us is that a lot of other industrialized states are in the same boat,"" the Commissioner said in an interview."
Mr. Hoffman said that 15 other states were now borrowing from the Federal Government to pay unemployment benefits.
"However, the total of $65.6 billion was still a record deficit for any fiscal year in the nation's history. The deficit in the fiscal year 1975 was S43.6 aillion."
"Total Federal expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30 were $365.6 billion, $7.9 billion below Government estimates in January. Government receipts totaled $300 billion, up $2.5 billion from the January estimate."
The change in the deficit was forecast by Government officials earlier this month. They said the Government had sharply overestimated expenditures in several areas.
"PARIS, March 24 (Reuters)— President Valery Giscard d’Es-taing, fighting to restore his political prestige, said tonight that economic recovery was on the way and pledged to pursue his program of responsible reforms."
"The 7.9 percent national unemployment rate was a return to the August level from 7.8 percent in September. The number of persons unemployed, adjusted to account for normal seasonal swings, stood at 7,569,000 last month, up 185,000 from September."
"Washington—Early this month, the Labor Department announced its latest statistics on employment in the United States. The number of jobless dropped from 8 million in October to"
"A closer look at the figures, as appalling as they are, reveals a chilling picture. The fact is that for millions of blacks as well as whites the job scene is incredibly bleak. The crucial statistic, the one showing the number of employed, remained almost motionless.-"
"Even more critical is the fact that the Government’s method for calculating unemployment is rigged, deliberately designed to conceal the true level, understating it by almost half."
"The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the jobless rate in February was 7.5 percent, up two-tenths of a percentage point from January’s 7.3 percent. This means that 7,183.000 people were out of work in the survey period, the second week of the month."
"At the same time, the number of employed workers rose by about 400,000 in February and stood at SS.962,000 in the survey period."
"Shiskin said that nearly all of the increase in unemployment was a result of layoffs caused by fuel shortages, which in turn were a result of the record cold temperatures earlier in the year."
"""As far as I can judge, the economy is improving on its own,” the durable, crdstily independent American monetary chief told the House Banking Commitlee. ""It’s not clear that any stimulus is needed at all.”"
"While asserting that the economy was moving ahead strongly enough on its own speed, Dr. Burns did suggest ways to improve its performance. Among his ideas were that the Government should cut corporate tax levies and act as ""employer of last resort” for those who want to work but cannot find jobs. Under his proposal, however, the pay would be below the minimum wage."
Mr. Kendrick said that the rise in consumer prices in 1977 was projected to remain close to last year’s increase of less than 6 percent.
"‘‘Here is a government that legislates inflation,” says Arthur F. Burns, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Illustratively, Dr. Burns cites the new law increasing the minimum wage and the pending legislation that would raise Social Security payroll taxes, especially those paid by employers."
"In an interview last week, Dr. Burns was less critical of the Administration’s proposed increase in energy taxes— another inflationary measure—because he believes American dependence on foreign oil is a grave problem."
"Administration economists are uncomfortably aware that these and other bills supported by President Carter and Washington’s successful efforts to curb exports to this country of shoes and television sets, as well as some proposed regulatory actions, all add to business costs, thus tending to drive up prices—in what economists call cost-price pressure."

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24—A sense of anxiety about prospects for reducing unemployment and warding off protectionism was registered today at a meeting here of finance ministers and central bank governors of leading industrial and third-world countries."
"Emil Van Lennep, secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, told the gathering that his group, which monitors economic growth and development, had just lowered its projections for activity next year."
"Because measures for economic stimulation just announced by West Germany and Japan are judged inadequate to give the world much of a lift, the organization' now sees economic growth prospects in, the industrial countries below 4 percent next year, compared with above 4 percent in forecasts made last June."
i The meaning of the assessment Is that the balance of risks is now negative and that the world economic recovery from the deepest postwar slump could simply fade away by 1979 and 1980 if fresh action is not taken.
"Labor Secretary Ray Marshall described the 34.8 percent jobless rate among black youths this summer as ""critical.”"
"The Labor Department, meanwhile, reported that joblessness among groups eligible for unemployment compensation had risen again, prompting the Government to renew extended benefits in 38 states."
These reports were a reminder that unemployment remains historically high despite efforts to spur hiring. Some economists are predicting a new recession in 1978. The national jobless rate was 6.9 percent in July.

Economists said the news should be good for retailers this holiday season by strengthening both consumer confidence and spending.
"On the heels of a significant upward revision in statistics for the third quarter’s output of goods and services and reports of healthy increases in the pace of housing starts and retail sales, today’s Consumer Price Index is a further indication that the economy remains in pretty vigorous shape even after more than 30, months of recovery from the deepest postwar recession."
"“Reports of the death of the economic expansion, like those of Mark. Twain at one time, are greatly exaggerated,’’ an economist for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust observed."

"Finds Stagflation Continues At a hearing on the unemployment situation by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Senator William Prox-mire, Democrat of Wisconsin, said the September figures indicated that the economy was still in a period of “stagflation,” meaning that economic growth was stagnant while inflation grew."
The persistent high rate of unemployment is putting increased pressure on the Carter Administration to take additional steps to increase economic growth and reduce the jobless rolls.
"DENVER—An ambitious effort to document the effects of a major city on its environment has shown that one city—St. Louis—significantly increases downwind rainfall and farm productivity, intensifies hail damage and apparently reduces lung efficiency in its residents."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 — A Washington-based research group says prices of basic necessities such as food, shelter, medical care and energy rose much more sharply in the second quarter of 1978 than the Government’s inflation statistics indicate."
"Its study, released today, concluded that prices of the four basic necessities rose at a rate of 15 percent from March to June 1978. The Government’s Consumer Price Index for the period showed an 11.2 percent increase in prices, about one-third less, but that index measures prices for a variety of essential and non-essential items."
"“Since 80 percent of American households spend nearly 70 percent of their income on ‘big four’ basic necessities, our index shows that inflation in items that American families need was dramatically worse than generalized inflation statistics reveal,’’ said Gar Alperovitz and Jeff Faux, codirectors of the National Center for Economic Alternatives, the private, nonprofit research group that conducted the study."

"At a news conference at the Homestead here after an address to the Business Council, a group of top business, financial and banking executives, Mr. Miller said that the President's -announcement was “very properly made."" He added that the lowering of the net tax reduction plan to $19.4 billion and the change in its effective date was “a major step in reducing the deficit.”"
"Mr. Miller indicated, moreover, that the President’s new proposal could encourage the Federal Reserve to slow its upward push of interest rates by tightening credit. ""The more discipline we have in fiscal policy,” he said, ""the more pressure we take off monetary policy."""

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 — Consumer prices rose by 1 percent last month, mainly reflecting the sharpest rise in housing costs in three decades after austerity moves on Oct. 6 by the Federal Reserve System, the Government reported today."
"Although energy and food items increased at a slower pace than in earlier months, the higher housing costs left the overall advance in the Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index about where it has been all year and assured a 1979 rate of inflation that will be the worst since 1916, after the dismantling of wartime wage and price controls."
"Consumer prices in the 18-county New York-northeastern New Jersey region continued their steady upward climb, rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in October after an unusually sharp surge the month before. Price rises in housing, fuel and food were primarily blamed for October’s increase. [PageA22.]"
"The national index in October stood at 225.4, which means that goods and services costing $100 in 1967 cost $225.40 last month."
"In the last 12 months, prices have risen by 12.2 percent. Patrick Jackman, chief of the consumer price section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that when the figures for the last two months of the year were in, the 1979 inflation rate would show the biggest increase since the 18.2 percent by which prices rose from December 1945 to December 1946."
have warned that the expected recession will largely wipe out the economic gains the city has made over the last two years.

"Moreover, the two banks cautioned that the recession could possibly jeopardize the Koch administration’s four-year financial recovery plan for the city."
"Mayor Koch responded to the reports. “We will do whatever we can locally to live within our annual revenues. The larger picture, as it relates to employment and the national economy, we have to leave to the President and Congress."" l-ear about the effect of a recession was cited by the Mayor a week ago as a major reason that his optimism had subdued about the city’s ability to balance its budget and re-enter the bond market on its own in 1982, when Federal loan guarantees expired."
"Entire cities and regions as well as the classic industries of American capitalism are caught up in a crisis that they cannot resolve on their own. The Federal Reserve Board and the experts are not even sure what the money supply is, yet they persist in the belief that if only they control this unknown, all will work out for the best. And the fact of the matter emphasized in this anniversary year with astonishing neatness is that nothing less than a new New Deal—that is, a movement much more radical than the old New Deal — will allow the nation to cope with the crisis of ’79."
"There is, of course, an eerie sense of deja vu as the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the stock-market crash. History celebrates the Crisis of ’29 with the Crisis of 79."
"Kathy Paulo of Fremont, Calif., would like to be able to afford ""some meat, instead of just more potatoes,” in a stew. A widowed Rochester shipping clerk worries that ""we’ll all be living by candlelight” because of high electricity rates. Arthur K. Bamum of Lewiston, N. Y., wants a President “who does something about inflation, even if he does it wrong.”"
"Their views are typical of the 40 percent of the American public who regard inflation as the most important problem they want 1980 Presidential candidates to deal with, according to the latest New York Times/CBSNews Poll."
"Inflation was cited as most important twice as often as was energy. Its importance was made even more insistent by the fact that it was cited 10 times as often as unemployment as the nation’s most serious problem — a political measure of historic importance, especially for Democrats, who have traditionally concentrated more on unemployment than on inflation."
"Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, asserted today that Americans must accept a reduction in their living standards, if inflation is to be reduced."
"In that logic, Mr. Volcker was following not only similar remarks of his own of recent weeks, but also the identical line of argument that the Administration has put forward for many months. Administration economists regard as their top anti-inflation priority preventing the recent surge in energy and housing prices from spilling over into wages."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 — Last Saturday, in a dramatic evening news conference, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, disclosed a package of steps, including higher interest rates, intended to curb inflation, rescue the dollar and halt rampant speculation in commodities."
"A. Three. First, it raised the rate it charges banks that borrow from it by a full percentage point to 12 percent, the highest level in history. Although little money Is actually borrowed that way, it Is indicative of the course other Interest rates are likely to take."
"The financial crisis and Great Recession have their roots in the housing bust. When it conies, a lasting recovery will be evident in a housing rebound. Unfortunately, housing appears to be weakening anew."
"Figures released last week show that after four months of gains, home prices flattened in October. At that time, low mortgage rates (courtesy of the Federal Reserve) and a home buyer's tax credit (courtesy of Congress) were fueling sales. That should have propped up prices. But it was not enough to overcome the drag created by a glut of 3.2 million new and existing unsold single-family homes — about a seven-month supply."
"The situation, we fear, will only get worse in months to come. Rates already are starting to rise as lenders brace for the Fed to curtail support for mortgage lending as early as the end of March. The home buyer’s tax credit is scheduled to expire at the end of April. And a new flood of foreclosed homes is ready to hit the market."
It is increasingly clear that the Ohama administration's anti-foreclosure effort — which pressed lenders to reduce interest rates — isn't doing nearly enough. High unemployment rates also mean that many borrowers who did qualify for aid have been unable to keep up with even reduced monthly payments.
"As a result, an estimated 2.4 million foreclosed homes will be added to the existing glut in 2010, driving prices down by another 10 percent or so. That would bring the average decline nationwide to about 40 percent since the peak of the market in 2006."
"i The unemployment rate unex-I pectedly dipped to 9.7 percent in ! January, from 10 percent in December, the government reported Friday, buoying hopes that the worst job market in at least a quarter-century is finally improving."
"Manufacturing added 11,000 jobs in January, the first monthly increase since November 2007, while the length of the average workweejt rose slightly at factories. The economy added 52,000 temporary workers, and average wages increased modestly, amplifying the view that commercial activity is reawakening after two years of hibernation."
"chief economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, N.C. “You don’t have a boom, but you have an economic recovery. It’s a positive sign.”"
"The American economy lost fewer jobs than expected last month, bolstering hopes that the worst may finally be over in the wrenching event known as the Great Recession."
"The monthly snapshot of the job market released by the Labor Department on Friday was hardly cause for celebration: about 36,000 jobs disappeared from the economy in February, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.7 percent."
"Yet compared with monthly job losses of more than .650,000 a year earlier, and against a backdrop of recent news viewed as pointing to the possibility of a slide back into recession, most economists construed the report as a sign that a tenuous recovery might be gaining momentum."
"“It’s strikingly good/’ said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, who has been skeptical about earlier signs of recovery. ""It's much better than it had been looking.”"
"The February job losses followed a drop of 26,000 in January. Most experts now expect the economy to begin steadily gaining jobs during the spring, as employers edge toward hiring."
"Now city officials and private economists are revising their forecasts with a drastic change in tone. The gathering consensus is that the recession is nearly over in the city and, largely because of the enormous amount of federal aid poured into the big banks, the toll on New York will be much less severe than most had feared."
"Not only will the job losses in the city fall far short of the recession that wracked the metropolitan area in the early 1990s, economists and analysts say they will also not measure up to the losses in the shorter, shallower recession that surrounded the 9/11 attacks. Where once the projections called for employment in the city to decline by as many as"

A bad day in the stock market turned into one of the most terrifying moments in Wall Street history on Thursday with a brief
It lasted just 16 minutes but left Wall Street experts and ordinary investors alike struggling to come to grips with what had happened — and fearful of where the markets might go from here.
"At least part of the sell-off appeared to be linked to trader error, perhaps an Incorrect order routed through one of the nation’s exchanges, Many of those trades may be reversed so investors do not lose money on questionable transactions."
"But the speed and scale of the plunge — the largest intraday decline on record — seemed to feed fears that the financial troubles gripping Europe were at last reaching across the Atlantic. Amid the rout, new signs of stress emerged in the credit markets. European banks seemed to -be growing wary of lending to each other, suggesting the debt crisis was entering a more dangerous phase."
"The bill, however, has no chance of passage in the Senate, where even some Democrats say the tax cuts should be extended for everyone, at least temporarily, given the continued weakness ! in the economy."
"The bipartisan support for the tax deal also underscored the urgency felt by the administration and by lawmakers in both parties to prop up the still-struggUflg economy and to prevent mi across-the-board tax mcreSe that was set to occur if the njtts enacted under President GeqSe W. Bush had expired, as scMd-uled, at the end of the month."
"The bill extends for two years all of the Bush-era tax rates and provides a one-year payroll tax cut for most American workers, delivering what economists predict will be a needed lift. The Senate approved the package on Wednesday by 81 to 19."
A Republican won in Massachusetts - and suddenly it’s not clear whether the Senate will confirm Ben Bernanhc for a second term ns Federal Reserve chairman. That's not as strange as it sounds: Washington has suddenly noticed public rage over economic policies that bailed out big banks but failed to create jobs. And Mr. Bernanke has become a symbol of those policies.
"As economic recovery wavers In the United States, evidence is mounting that growth abroad is also slowing and may be unable to sustain the fragile rebound here."
"A day after Federal Reserve officials warned that the pace of the nation's recovery had slowed, a trio of reports released on Wednesday cast new shadows over tlie global economy."
"Finally, new trade figures from Washington showed that American exports were faltering, a sign that hard-pressed domestic manufacturers could not rely on overseas markets to ease their pain at home."
"Together, the reports unnerved financial markets that were still on edge from the Fed’s downbeat news on Tuesday. The stock market tumbled in a 265-point decline that drove the Dow Jones industrial average back into die red for the year. The broad market fell"
"Washington * FTER month's of debate, Senate Democrats this summer / \ broke a Republican filibuster /■1"" % against a bill to extend un-JL. ^employment benefits. But the Republicans insisted on applying a technicality in the Senate rules that allowed for 30 more hours of floor time after a successful vote to end debate. As a result, the bill — with its desperately needed and overdue benefits for more than 2 million unemployed Americans — was pointlessly delayed a few days more."
"Two Democratic senators who arc up for re-election this year announced that they would oppose Mr. Bernanke, whose four-year term as head of the central bank expires at the end of this month. Their decisions reflected a surge of opposition among some Democrats and Republicans to Mr. Bernanke, a primary architect of the bailout of the financial system and a contributor to policies that critics contend put the economy at risk in the first place."
"nomination to show voters they understood the anger about bailouts and economic hardship, the uncertainty about Mr. Ber-nanke’s fate spread to Wall Street."
"It contributed to another day of losses for investors at the end of a three-day slide that drove the markets down almost 5 percent, The Dow ended the week at its lowest close since early November. (Page B7.]"
"BUSIN ESSES of every sort have been sucker-punched by the recession, but at least one enterprise has continued to grow through the downturn: auto repossession."
"More than 1.9 million cars were recovered on behalf of lenders in 2009, a jump of 90,000 over the previous year and the latest in a decadelong string of annual ! increases, according to Tom Webb, chief | economist of the consulting arm of Man-I heim Auctions."
"Today, Mr. Bernanke is the Fed’s chairman — and his 2002 speech reads like famous last words. We aren’t literally suffering deflation (yet). But inflation is far below the Fed’s preferred rate of 1.7 to 2 percent, and trending steadily lower; it’s a good bet that by some measures we’ll be seeing deflation by sometime next year. Meanwhile, we already have painfully slow growth, very, high joblessness, and intractable financial problems. And what is the Fed’s response? It’s debating — with ponderous slowness — whether maybe, possibly, it should consider trying to do something about the situation, one of these days."
"The Fed’s fecklessness is, to be sure, not unique. It has been astonishing and infuriating, as the economic crisis has unfolded, to watch America's political class defining normalcy down. As recently as two years ago, anyone predicting the current state of affairs (not only is unemployment disastrously high, but most forecasts say that it will stay very high for years) would have been dismissed as a crazy alarmist. Now that the nightmare has become reality, however — and yes, it is a nightmare for millions of Americans — Washington seems to feel absolutely no sense of urgency. Are hopes being destroyed, small businesses being driven into bankruptcy, lives being blighted? Never mind, let’s talk about the evils of budget deficits."
"Investing is scary these days. Is it safe to go back in the stock market? Is the bond market the place to be? With so much uncertainty, how can investors know where to put their money? Morningstar, the mutual fund research service, is on to an answer, but it might not make you feel better about your financial advisers."
"KM KB URN, Ga. - Frank Sanders can visualize how his tidy, green-shuttered mobile home will deteriorate if he does not regain unemployment benefits."
"iug canned food donated by churches. The mobile home itself? By next month, he will have spent his last rent money, and then Mr. Sanders, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran who lost his job its a welder last year, is bracing for the possibility of homelessness."
"* We’re running low on time,” said Mr. Sanders, a bulky former Air Force parachutist who lives with his disabled wife, Ruth, in thi« small Atlanta suburb. Their monthly income of S948 in Spcial Security benefits does not cbver her medical expenses, let alone their car, phone, rent, food or electrical costs, he said. ‘‘The bills just keep piling up.”"
"Add to that grim outlook a new concern: This week is the first since Mr. Sanders lost his job in May 2009 that they will not receive S323 in government unemployment benefits. Unless Congress approves a measure extending federal assistance for the long-term unemployed, they will he among more than two million jobless Americans who will lose their benefits by the end of this month. So there is a special urgency to Mr. Sanders’s daily trips around town in his Chevy Trail-blazer, applying for jobs at fast-food restaurants, construction sites and retail stores. An artist by hobby, he also paints landscapes on common items — milk jugs, vinyl records, buzz saws — and sells them for SI5."
"Such hardship is humbling. Raised in a working-class family and employed all of his life until last year, Mr. Sanders went to a food bank for a donated Thanksgiving turkey. ‘ I’m supposed to be the provider, I’m supposed to be taking care of the situation,” he said. “There I ;am begging for food."""
"Any stimulative effects of a cut, however, are likely to be temporary. The economy needs longer-term help."
"Rate cuts won’t attack the proximate causes of today's economic turmoil — widespread mortgage defaults at one end of the economic scale and a credit squeeze afflicting Wall Street at the other, both rooted in the excesses of the housing boom."
"A rate cut will not make most exploding adjustable rate mortgages affordable, because those loans are set to rise to market-based interest rates from very low teaser rates. The increases in monthly payments will be huge even if the Fed cuts its rates by half a percentage point — and it may cut less than that."
"Nor will a rate cut magically loosen credit. Rate cuts generally juice the economy through mortgage lending. But the mortgage market has seized up, and is likely to remain cramped as long as lenders are unsure about the source and extent of losses on mortgage-related investments held by banks, financial firms and hedge funds. A rate cut will not make the system more transparent."
"The stock market plunged late in the afternoon yesterday, registering its biggest drop in three weeks as investors were hit by fresh worries over declining consumer confidence, falling house prices, shrinking profits on Wall Street and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve."
"Stocks were down most of the day, but the biggest drop came in the last half-hour of trading as computerized trading programs, which automatically sell when stocks fall by predetermined percentages, amplified the gloomy mood that had prevailed from the start. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 280.28, or 2.1 percent, at 13,041.85. It was the steepest one-day decline in the Dow since Aug. 9, when it shed 387.18 points."
"The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite were each down 2.4 percent, with all but 13 of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 down for the day."
"Analysts said there appeared to be no specific catalyst for the decline. Rather, investors received a steady drumbeat of discouraging news about the intertwined woes of the housing industry, the mortgage market, hedge funds and a broader credit crunch that the Federal Reserve Continued on PageAl8 might have difficulty alleviating in the short run without creating longer-term problems for the economy."
"""Concern about the credit issue is dominant across all the markets,” said John Shinn, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers. “Everything is dominated by concerns about the unknown.” Two separate reports released yesterday showed that consumer confidence fell this month and that home prices nationwide continued their slide in June."
"WASHINGTON - Ben S. Ber-' nnnke, chairman at the Federal; Reserve, signaled his readiness on Wednesday to bolster the! economy with cheaper money even though inflation Is picking up speed."
"The red chairman acknowledged that the central bank faced increasingly contradictory pressures of slowing growth and rising consumer prices. Blit Ills bottom line was that, for now, the top priority would be fighting a recession rather than fighting inflation."
"Mr. Bernankc's view of the state ot the economy, part of his semiannual appearance before Congress, came ns the dollar' sank to a historic low against other major currencies, introducing a possible third dimension to the economic problems tiie Fed chairman must tackle all at once."
"Having already cut short-term interest rates by almost half since September, Mr. Bernanke palmed a grim picture of consumers reluctant to spend, businesses reluctant to invest and banks reluctant to lend. On top of it all, housing prices keep falling."
"Economists viewed tne report as the most powerful Indication to date that the United States could well be falling Into a recessionary downturn. Evidence of widening unemployment heightened anticipation that the Federal Reserve would further cut interest rates this month, perhaps by an unusually large half a percentage point, In a bid to prevent the economy from sliding Into the muck."
"""Tills is unambiguously negative,” said Mark Znndl, chief economist at Moody’s Economy .com. ""The economy Is on the edge of recession, if we’re not already engulfed In one."""
"The swift deterioration in the job market resonated ns n warning sign that troubles once confined to real estate and construction are spilling Into the broader economy, threatening the ability of American consumers to keep spending with customary abandon."
"On Wall Street, the report led to a big sell-off that sent the Dow Jones Industrial average plunging nearly 2 percent.

"Strong evidence is emerging tlint consumer spending, a bulwark against recession over the last year even ns energy prices surged and the housing market sputtered, has begun to slow sharply at every level of the American economy, from the working class to the wealthy."
"The abrupt pullback raises the possibility that the country may be experiencing a rare decline in personal consumption, not just a slower rate of growth. Such a decline would be the first since 1991, and it would almost certainly push the entire economy Into a recession in the middle of an election year."
"There are mounting anecdotal signs that beginning In December Americans cut back significantly on personal consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy."
"A raft of consumer companies — high-end stores like Nordstrom and Tiffany, and middle-of-the-road ones like Target and J. C. Penney — reported a pronounced slowdown in growth last"
"American Express said that starting in early December the growth in the rate of spending by its 52 million cardholders, a generally affluent group of consumers, fell 3 percentage points, from 13 percent to 10 percent, the first slowdown since the 2001 recession."
"Presenting n blenk picture of n deteriorating notional economy, Ben S, Bcrnnnke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, strongly suggested on Thursday that the Fed would cut Interest rates soon, perhaps by a large amount."
"""The outlook for real activity In 2008 has worsened,"" Mr, Ber-nnnke said after describing all the forces dragging down the economy. ""We stand ready lo take substantive additional actions as needed to support growtli and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks."""
"With fears rising that the economy Is sliding Into recession, Mr. Bernnnkc's blunt assessment Is expected to encourage politicians to call on Congress to take steps that would stimulate growth beyond what the Fed can achieve through lower Interest rates."
"Many analysts now expect the Fed's policy makers to cut half a percentage point off the Fed’s benchmark Interest rate, reducing It to 3.75 when they next meet, on Jan. 2D and 30. They expect the Fed to continue cutting, to 3 percent or even lower by summer, to prevent — or at least mitigate — a recession. The goal would be to get people to borrow nnd spend more."
"Consumer spending, however, may already have hit a wall. Shortly before Mr. Bernankc spoke, at a Washington luncheon, the nation’s biggest retailers announced that holiday sales gains were the weakest in the last five years. Only Wal-Mart gained “Bernnnke should have made this commitment to cut rates aggressively two or three months ago,” said Mark Zandl, chief economist at Moody’s Economy-.com. “Will It be enough? It will be close. With aggressive rate cuts, some fiscal stimulus and a bit of luck, maybe we’ll avoid a recession.”"

"WASHINGTON — The head of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve began discussions on Thursday with Congressional leaders on what could become the biggest bailout in United States history. While details remain to be worked out, the plan is likely to authorize the government to buy distressed mortgages at deep discounts from banks and other institutions. The proposal could result in the most direct commitment of taxpayer funds so far in the financial crisis that Fed and Treasury officials say is the worst they have ever seen."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Bush’s top economic adviser said Sunday that some regions of the United States were struggling with high jobless rates and seemed to be in recession.
"""We are seeing what anyone would characterize as a recession in some parts of the country,” the adviser, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN."
"Mr. Lazear says the administration ""has taken the right steps” to thaw out credit markets and get loans flowing to businesses and consumers."

"The rising cost of college — even before the recession — threatens to put higher education out of reach for most Americans, according to the annual report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education."
"Over all, tne report tound, published college tuition and fees increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, adjusted for inflation, while median family income rose 147 percent. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade, and students from lower-income families, on average, get smaller grants from the colleges they attend than students from more affluent families."
"“If we go on this way for another 25 years, we won’t have an affordable system of higher education,’’ said Patrick M. Caban, president of the center, a nonpartisan organization that promotes access to higher education."
"“When we come out of the recession,"" Mr. Callan added, ""we’re really going to be in jeopardy, because the educational gap between our work force and the rest of the world will make it very hard to be competitive. Already, we’re one of the few countries where 25- to 34-year-olds are less educated than older workers.” ""The middle class has been financing it through debt,” he said. “The scenario has been that families that have a history of sending kids to college will do whatever if takes, even if that means a huge amount of debt.”"
"But low-income students, he said, will be less able to afford college. Already, he said, the strains are clear."
"In a sign that American workers may face even more difficult times for many months to come, the nation’s unemployment rate last month jumped to the highest level in 14 years as job losses mounted."
"Gloomy enough was word from the government on Friday that a fresh 240,000 American jobs disappeared in October, the 10th consecutive month of retrenchment. It brought the toll of lost jobs to 1.2 million for the year — more than half in the last three months alone — while the unemployment rate climbed to 6.5 percent. Worse was the sense that little could be done near term to alter this now-accelerating trajectory."
"President-elect Barack Obama, speaking at his first news conference since winning Tuesday’s election, sounded resigned to inheriting a starkly troubled economy when he moves into the White House next year."
"""It’s not going to be quick, and it's not going to be easy to dig ourselves out of the hole that we’re in,” Mr. Obama said, calling for swift passage of spending measures aimed at stimulating the economy, including another extension of unemployment benefits."
"But while experts said this could soften the damage, it was unlikely to change the fundamentals. They said' the economy would probably lose several hundred thousand jobs a month well into next year, taking the unemployment rate to near 8 percent — a level last seen a quarter-century ago."
"In 1929, Meyer Mishkin owned a shop in New York that sold silk shirts to workingmen. When the stock market crashed that October, he turned to his son, then a student at City College, and offered a version of this sentiment: It serves those rich scoun-economic drels right scene A year later, as Wall Street’s problems were starting to spill into the broader economy, Mr. Mishkin’s store went out of business. He no longer had enough customers. His son had to go to work to support the family, and Mr. Mishkin never held a steady job again."
"Washington fear that the country is starting to spiral into a terrible downturn. And to their horror, they see the public, and many members of Congress, turning into modern-day Meyer Mishkins, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy."
"It’s not enough to say that markets could freeze up, loans could become impossible to get and the economy could slide into its worst downturn since the Great Depression. For now, the crisis has had little effect on most Americans, beyond their 401(k) statements. So to them, the spec-Continued on Page A24 ter of a depression can sound alarmist, and the $700 billion bill that Congress voted down this week can seem like a bailout for rich scoundrels."
"Mitt Romney offered an ambitious plan Friday to try to forestall a recession, proposing a $250 billion economic stimulus package with sweeteners for supply-side conservatives, older Americans and corporations."
"Mr. Romney’s proposal, outlined in a telephone interview during a campaign swing through Nevada, is grounded in new, permanent income tax reductions. It is also double the size of stimulus packages offered by two of the Democratic presidential candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, and far exceeds the $145 billion plan that President Bush suggested to Congress on Friday."
"Charles A. Lowenhaupt spoke first on the conference call, informing 15 members of the very rich family that employs him that he could not in good faith promise that their fortune would remain intact through the economic crisis, then gently reminding them to be grateful for their health, loved ones — and the hundreds of millions of dollars they still had."
"Then five of Mr. Lowenhaupt’s employees, each of them intimately familiar with the family’s investment portfolio, real estate holdings, trust funds and charitable foundation — as well as the psychological particulars of the people on the call —took turns describing the ramifications of the market turmoil. Throughout the 30-minute telephone conversation on one of the many recent days of triple-digit declines in the Dow, there was silence from the wealthy family members. Mr. Lowenhaupt had put their lines on mute."
"Mr. Lowenhaupt, 61, is chief executive of Lowenhaupt Global Advisors, an 18-employee firm that serves as the “family office” for four multigenerational clans whose ultrawealthy members are spread throughout the United States and Europe — a rarefied perch from which to observe the financial fallout. He is a lawyer, investment manager, estate planner, philanthropy expert, inter-generational mediator and a hopeless proselytizer on the near impossibility of simultaneously being rich and happy, who makes sure his clients’ bills are paid, homes are staffed, and annual family meetings planned."
"Either Barack Obama or John McCain could well become the first U.S. president since John F. Kennedy to be elected during a recession, not to mention a financial crisis. What sort of nation will the winner inherit? Although the string of bank failures and panic on Wail Street has overtones of the 1930s, the risk is less a repeat of the Great Depression than that of another Japan, which, following a stock-market and real-estate mania that peaked in 1989, suffered through a so-called “lost decade"" — 10 years of economic stagnation and a seemingly unending cycle of falling asset values and government bailouts."
"nomic calamities, and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are trying to walk a very fine line — injecting hundreds of billions into the financial system while not propping up so much deadwood that the system can never recover. President Obama/McCnin will face a similar tension — how many failing mortgage holders to resuscitate, how much and what sort of fiscal stimulus?"
"But they also will have to deal with a knottier set of issues. What can Washington do to break the pathologic cycle of speculative boom followed by titanic bust? It is true that booms and busts are inevitable features of markets; to paraphrase a Wall Street truism, were it not for speculators perhaps neither the railroads nor Google would have been financed."
"But when markets require bailouts ol the two largest mortgage companies, an investment bank and a giant insurer in the space of six months — with a general mortgage bailout in the works — it is a sign that the system has stopped working. More explicitly, the system encouraged and permitted a degree of risk that has proved intolerable."

In the first sit- down 16 percent from its current level, and Ms. X’s 401 (k) will be worth $1,000 At this point, she appears to be suffering from the market’s drop, as is everyone else. But keep in mind how she will invest over the remainder of her career. Ms. X has no plans to take money out of her account for many years, she will only add to it — say $1,000 each year starting in 2002."
"SO she benefits from a market that does not grow in value too soon. “Theoretically, the best thing that could happen for people who are younger,” said Richard E. Reibman, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, “is for the stock market to remam depressed while they’re mvesting and to rise dramatically just before they retire.” And the worst thmg that could happen would be for the S & P. 500 to shoot to 8,000 next week and stay there for 35 years, giving Ms. X’s investment the approximate long-term return of cash sitting in a drawer."
"Between those two extremes, small differences m the index’s growth rate can have a major impact on a portfolio over 35 years Return to the first situation, in which the S & P. 500 eRds the year at 1,500 To reach 8,000 by 2036, the index would need to grow 5 percent each year, leaving Ms X with about $95,000 when she was 65."
"If the S & P instead declines further this year, and closes at about 1,000, it would need to increase more than 6 percent a year to reach 8,000 three decades from now. In that case, Ms X would have $125,000 in 2036, because she would be able to buy more stock for her money in the crucial first decade of her investments The difference between the two final totals is 30 percent For a generation that may not be able to rely on Social Security as its parents can, that may represent the difference between a comfortable retirement and a difficult one Some will quibble with the assumption that the S & P will be at 8,000 in both situations It may seem more logical to think that the higher the market is today, the higher it is likely to be in the future. But remember what a stock is. a claim on the future earnings of a company. If the market was overvalued at its peak a year ago, as many analysts believe, it will likely grow sluggishly in the years ahead, until earnings catch up to the expectations of share prices “There’s very little public recognition that future returns depend on current price,” said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economics professor and the author of “Irrational Exuberance ”"
"EAST BRUNSWICK, N J , March 14 — With the stock market tumbling again and fears growing about economic problems at home and abroad. President Bush said today that he was “concerned that a lot of Americans’ portfolios have been affected” bv the steeo sell-off m the first two months of his presidency In his comments, first to reporters and then in a speech to several chambers of commerce here, Mr Bush seemed intent on conveying at least a glancing sense of optimism after months in which Democrats have accused him of talking down the economy as a way of building support for his $1 6 trillion tax cut."
"The president first spoke only minutes after the market opened with a 300-pomt plunge m the Dow Jones industrial average, as investors reacted to a deteriorating corporate earnings outlook in the United States and growing questions about financial stability in Japan Although prices fluctuated throughout the day, the Dow lost 317 34 to close at 9,973 46, the first time stnee October that the bellwether index finished a day below 10,000 [Page Cl ]"

just months ago The economy here m Silicon Valley is a tram wreck. And some of our suffering may be attributed to the ill-timed discount rate hikes in 2000 that the Fed is now desperately trying to reverse
"To be fair, no one — not even here in Silicon Valley — would have predicted that the dot-com crash would have spread so quickly to Internet infrastructure builders and to the technology sector in general. What the Fed did not know was that the economy it was trying to slow down was about to come to an abrupt halt on its own And that’s the point: There is a fundamental flaw in the Fed’s operational assumption that it can know enough about the future to fine-tune the economy without continually making mistakes."
"All of a sudden, the light at the end of the economic tunnel doesn’t seem to be getting any closer. For much of this year, analysts expected the Federal Reserve Board’s half-dozen cuts in interest rates to shift the economy out of neutral by the fourth quarter. Now, as autumn nears, medium- and long-term interest rates remain prohibitively high, and each day brings news of more layoffs. Pundits seize upon any sign of a turnaround, such as last month’s growth in new home construction. Clearly, however, companies are finding few reasons to increase their investments. One obvious problem is that the Fed and the Bush administration are working at cross purposes."
"The Fed has been steadily lowering the federal funds rate — the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other on a day-to-day basis — with the hope that other lending rates will follow suit. Since January, short-term rates have fallen by almost three percentage points. A drop in inflation, driven mainly by lower energy costs, has given the Fed room to make another cut at its meeting today. But rates on loans and mortgages with terms of five years and longer have barely responded."
"One cause of the stickiness in long-term rates is the widespread belief that the economy will resume its productivity-driven boom in the next few years. Another cause is more troubling — uncertainty about the federal government’s finances. Corporate tax revenues have slackened, and declining business confidence suggests slim prospects for an uptick anytime soon. Forthcoming estimates from the White House and the Congressional Budget Office will almost definitely show drops in the projected budget surpluses. President Bush has already hamstrung the coming years’ federal budgets with his tax cut and his unrealistic allowances for discretionary spending. Smaller surpluses will force Congress to spend money that would other-"
"Congress has aggravated the problem by showing a disturbing lack of commitment to making these programs more sound. Given members’ disagreements on a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, chances for comprehensive reform look slim. The White House favors a flawed, politically unfeasible reform of Social Security and has dismissed the worsening budget forecasts. The specter of a ballooning federal debt, accompanied by high interest rates, looms larger by the day."
"Investors have also signaled their worries about the American economy through the dollar’s cascading fall against the euro, yen and British pound. The weaker dollar hurts American companies that depend on foreign financing because of scant domestic saving. Upward pressure on prices, and even higher interest rates, could result as well."

The slock market stabilized But the economy lost 223,000 jobs in April, the biggest downturn in more than a decade, and the unemployment rate rose to 4 5 percent from 4 3 percent Industrial production fell again last month And most worrying to many analysts, businesses continued to reduce investment spending plans In doing so, they dragged down a segment of the economy that had been a leading engine of growth and raised questions about whether gains in productivity. the most fundamental measure of the economy's long-term potential, could be sustained “The erosion in current and prospective profitability, in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook, seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward,” the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said m a statement “This potential re-stiaint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, continues to weigh on the economy ”"

"1 No sooner had George W. Bush become presi-; dent than he began warning of an impending reces-'sion and campaigning for a huge tax cut. But he forgot — or perhaps did not know — that a slowing '^economy, with lower corporate profits and personal . earnings, would automatically result in lower tax , collections and throw his knife-edged fiscal plan into : imbalance. So instead of residing peacefully in ‘“lockboxes” for the next decade, the trust funds '""collected to cover baby boomers’ Social Security -and Medicare benefits may be tapped as early as ' this year.

"1 It all began in January.

Medicare untouched for 10 years. But after Congress set its spending levels and passed Mr. Bush’s tax cut, less than $10 billion worth of leeway was left ' in this year’s budget before the government would have to pry open the lockboxes. Now, thanks to ' shrinking income tax revenues, that narrow margin of error is about to disappear."

According to the New York City coalition Against hunger, more than one million city residents depend on hard-pressed food pantries and soup kitchens for their basic needs. One-quarter of them are from households with one or more members who have jobs but not enough income to survive. They have turned to charity because all else has failed them."
"In this picture, one major failure has been the city’s handling of the food stamp program.
