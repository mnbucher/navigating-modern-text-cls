"This contraction in turn contributes to, and is made worse by, demands for new subsidies and import restrictions —	in some cases to protect sensitive industries from foreign competition, in others to reduce trade deficits and thus control foreign debt. Whatever the reason, any country whose economy depends in some degree on exports is hurt."

"Although net changes in the Industrial market were irregular, gains exceeded losses in most principal groups. However, shipping and shipbuilding shares remained dull on the news of an increase in the number of ships laid up. Store shares made a good recovery as did chemicals. Shares with an American content also made a good showing, although most of the improvement seemetrto be the result of marking up to take account of the rise on i Wall Street."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 19—The 'year of the first double-digit | inflation in peacetime, the year I of Watergate reckoning and of | the first Presidential resignation in American history, has also become a campaign year in iwhich national “issues,” in the (conventional sense, have almost disappeared.	I"

"The rail shares yielded from large fractions to more than 2 points, probably reflecting in part reports from Washington that the decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission on the applications of the carriers for a rise in freight rates would-be delayed until well into 1948.

While all the data are not in, she noted that the city’s services orientation did indeed offer a degree of recession protection, especially in the recent downturn, which was primarily in the auto and construction industries."
"Just as city policies didn't create the economic mess, neither will they eradicate it. The forces driving companies out of central business districts to the suburbs and beyond may subside, even reverse. If so, the city government will be a spectator to these trends, not a prime mover."
"Interest rates are creeping up, at least in part because the Fed has been trying to hold down the money supply. The issues now are how much restraint and whether to impose it by raising the discount rate. That is the rate banks pay when they bor- row to build required reserves. Increasing the rate would be formal notice that the Fed again fears inflation more than it fears slower growth."
"The lower rates were spurred by a cut Friday in the Federal Reserve’s discount rate to 11 percent from 11*£ percent. The rate represents the interest charged on loans by the Federal Reserve to member banks, and the cut reflected efforts by the Federal Reserve to encourage interest rate declines and stimulate the economy."

The slide in the stock market, analysts say, is a sign that many investors have given up hope for any relief from high interest rates in the near future. The expectation of large Federal deficits and heavy borrowing by the Treasury at a time when the Federal Reserve Board continues to restrict the flow of money and keep interest rates high in its effort to fight inflation has created fears on Wall Street that the economy may be in for a long slowdown."

"WASHINGTON, July 2 —No one knows at this juncture what kind of anti-inflation controls will be voted by Congress, to take effect after the extension to Aug. 1 of present regulations -has expired. The millions of unorganized citizens who are principally consumers, meaning they have nothing to sell but their services, may by then have exercised pressure on Congress which will counterbalance that successfully applied thus far by representatives of the meat, textile and commodity interests. Or world events,, including the armistice negotiations in Korea, may have increased the anti-controls trend of Congress beyond the high point reached in the bill passed by the Senate early last Friday morning."

"Sales taxes on road-related products are merely indirect taxes, like those on clothing or chocolates, and when there is a need for more revenue to reduce the inflationary impact of large deficits, sales taxes provide a ready source. The “nickel tax"" increase passed in 1984 was the most recent example of such thinking. Like most other road-sector fees and taxes throughout North America, it failed to come to grips with the challenge of economic efficiency, which requires that, since trucks do damage that varies exponentially with their weight, the prices they should pay to"

"All of a sudden, the light at the end of the economic tunnel doesn’t seem to be getting any closer. For much of this year, analysts expected the Federal Reserve Board’s half-dozen cuts in interest rates to shift the economy out of neutral by the fourth quarter. Now, as autumn nears, medium- and long-term interest rates remain prohibitively high, and each day brings news of more layoffs. Pundits seize upon any sign of a turnaround, such as last month’s growth in new home construction. Clearly, however, companies are finding few reasons to increase their investments. One obvious problem is that the Fed and the Bush administration are working at cross purposes."
