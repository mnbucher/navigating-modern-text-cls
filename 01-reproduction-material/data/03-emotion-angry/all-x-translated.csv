but when you complained about the complexity of german immigration law in your speech you used the term hypercomplex i had to think of another liberal politician several times
but also to the good fortune that helmut kohl as chancellor of unity with the allies managed to achieve this unity in peace and in friendship with our neighbors
but the breadth and depth of complaints also increased
but they haven't been able to do that for years either
but the fdp also wants to support startups
"but also in the centers themselves, people are happy about social contacts or the possibility of not having to sleep on board for once."
but even with the necessary security these will not be perfect elections
"but on the other hand, it is women and girls who suffer the most from the consequences of armed conflicts and violent conflicts."
but i will be happy to discuss his comments later on
"but due to the preparations for the election that was confirmed to us by the ministries, care is required with regard to the legal security of the european election we are now talking not only about a national election but about a european election in which other countries are also involved"
"but on the issues of migration, climate and finance, solutions still need to be found"
but you can't do both because it destroys trust
"but before you get upset, what is the content of this specifically about?"
but the current netzdg network enforcement law is the wrong way to go
but all this is only possible in a stable and secure environment
but the concern that we want to improve the situation of the long-term unemployed unites us
but of course the whole thing still hangs clearly
"but as i said, this is not a solution to society's problems"
but that's not enough they don't go far enough because as the name says they focus on participation and not enough on sustainable qualification for a sustainable integration into the first labor market.
but the problem here lies in the word something
but this also includes advancing political discussions together with our european partners.
but mr. kühnert will surely be happy about it
but this does not help the cities where people suffer particularly badly from car exhaust fumes
but still it was the triumph of diplomacy
but the conflict within mali was far from settled
but the reference to slowness and the necessity of consensus is often enough an excuse for lack of courage for despondency for irresponsible german bundestag 19
but that is why we need a stronger europe in which this is regulated accordingly
but the way they have done it is simply outrageous and that is the opposite of budgetary clarity and budgetary veracity
but the exploitation of employees in parts of the parcel industry is scandalous
but the employees are to be fobbed off with two percent - an impertinence
but the federal government has been silent for weeks about this war
but the federal government still has to agree in the european council
"but the question is honestly, are there cheaper alternatives?"
but the key question will be what is security in peace and freedom worth to each and every one of us in this society?
but the great empty formula of solidarity is only used by the left for the victims of right-wing violence
but the situation is still dramatic
but the service is worth more if there are also offers for social participation on the other side.
but the people in these countries need not only our support but also a strong civil society
but the lump sum is in itself completely unfair
but care must be improved and solidly financed
but the framework conditions are far too restrictive
but the top of the hypocrisy are the substantive demands in your application
but the agreed measures to reach the 2030 target are good
but these always refer only to individual concern and individual regulations
but this brand is actually good at it you are absolutely right
but this context dear green you completely fade out
but honestly we can not decide that
but actually the cop does something very central it will decide how the so-called rule book is structured
but one idea was good their idea of a free öpnv
but there is also a movement to improve the quality of daycare in almost all federal states
but there is a central difference every human being who flees from war and terror to come here is very welcome to us from the fraction die linke
"but it is very true that the recipe for success of the federal republic of germany is the social market economy, and the social market economy does not only mean that companies are not bullied by the state in their decisions, but it also means that business decisions, especially those that affect the material existence of people, must be made in the context of social responsibility."
but there would be good possibilities
but it is also a small country as big as hesse surrounded by enemies who want nothing more than its destruction
but it is a lesson from history and we must never refuse this lesson
but of course it is not a solution it is only a commandment of humanity
but it is not the only problem
but it is not the case that with your climate protection law a faster timetable is necessarily pursued
but there must also be education about the many misguided decisions to the detriment of refugees
but it must finally be said that it is not like that the federal government does nothing and the states stretch themselves and can do nothing the states could they have the money and the federal government supports them
but many less children would have to die money is enough
but it will be a herculean task to implement these regulations
but to accomplish this task we need to get the countries on board
"but for me, an investment in the future is the child construction allowance"

but mr. minister spahn i would have expected more courage from you
but mr. post i will quote again the greatest strength of our state these are the citizens the citizens in their freedom in their possibilities and their strengths
but here and now we can only reject the amendment bill presented in good conscience
but I think that's actually something positive for now.

but every second child says they are afraid of poverty
but now the federal government has a duty
but now another one is added and now it gets funny
but now they are supplying weapons and more and more weapons to saudi arabia which violates human rights daily and is waging war in yemen
but please let us debate and argue according to parliamentary rules
but according to the government citizens are only afraid and who protests is a nazi
but unfortunately these catastrophic abuses are not new they have been known for a long time
but dear colleagues i say daily greets the groundhog which is nice you started this time and not mrs. haßelmann
but dear colleagues it was already war
but some prefer to make lazy compromises instead of politics for the people
but people do not only flee from war and violence
but of course the world keeps on turning and we always have to find new answers to current questions
but of course the mission cannot solve the problems
but marriage has not eliminated all legal disadvantages for everyone
but now the draft is available
but it does not provide substantial evidence of an attack that would justify such self-defense
but it would not only be unusual it would be absurd and contradictory
but such salary differences are only an expression of gigantic exploitation
but structural improvements that would be possible given the record revenues have not been achieved
but still it remains neither condescension nor western arrogance
but nevertheless it would be quite a step in the right direction instead of announcement and symbolism now finally to make politics there came joy on I emphasize came
but our society is more socially divided than it has been for decades
but from 2015 to 2017 hardly any control seems to have taken place
but from them from the spd from the left from the green also from the fdp from the afd I do not even need to speak I have not heard a single proposal
but spd cdu and csu carry on completely undeterred
but then why don't they do what they could do here
but what does sustainable public procurement actually mean in practice
but what was remarkable was the disaster and population protection was not mentioned with a single word
but what kind of a constitutional state is it in which an unreasonable offender is given a suspended sentence?
but what makes our society strong
but if customers are forced to take a service then there are certainly some who rest and do not qualify accordingly
"but if we want to achieve a sustainable limitation and control of immigration, this can only be achieved through the interaction of national and international measures, dear colleagues."
but those who have worked and made provisions must always have more than basic security
but as so often in life hope dies last
but we encourage the states to provide a well-equipped judiciary.
but we are very happy about the great result in the bürgerschaftswahlen in bremen
but we believe that no choice is irreversible
but we as a state do not have the right to intervene in matters of faith
but we do have an innovative economy and an innovative science where innovative people work and do research
but we must also see that more is invested in the power plants
but we will only remain economically successful and lead the technological change if we have an efficient and well-developed transport infrastructure.
but why censor at all when you can just turn it off
but saying we are doing a political evaluation and i already know it was all wrong doesn't help at all
but for example the operation south flank in which we cleared the seas or the operation ace guard for the protection of turkey are still out of the picture

this brings us closer to the core of the problems in libya

we are sending a strong signal against censorship and surveillance on the internet
thus article 17 and the petitions committee are in themselves a natural remedy against hate mongering and exclusion we should make this clear to ourselves

the groko is missing the chance to make important investments in the future and is gambling away our future

Thus the Basic Law also realizes the liberation of the individual from the compulsion of group membership.
this is a way of labeling family connections from certain cultural circles as criminals across the board

so that we can continue to invest in the future and in social justice
"in order for us to continue to reap these benefits from the euro, we need to further stabilize economic and monetary union"
so that we can continue to grow and have more influence in the political discourse we need your support

we are very proud of this
unfortunately we are waiting in vain
"the 31 year old's application for asylum was then rejected - after all, they had already seized some explosives from him"
to derive from this the accusation of a politically caused organizational failure is absurd
"as a result, lsbt people are subject to significant discrimination and often suffer lifelong anxiety and fear of losing their jobs."
this ultimately results in the possibility of being able to defend oneself effectively up to the last word
she concludes we must make the voice of multilateralism as strong as possible
it follows that we must fight hatred of jews
from this we must conclude competitiveness and profits of private corporations are more important to the groko than human dignity
feel free to share mrs merkel you have failed
it is allowed to animate children to skip school for a special topic
there is only talk of cost causers of liars of serious criminals and criminals
therein also lies an opportunity
therein we should see our social policy for europe
that's why we're even celebrating reformation day nationwide this year

"moreover, only 20 cents of one euro earned is left over"
"in addition, the chairwoman barbara praetorius can rely on the professional support of a scientific assistant"
furthermore dear greens we have just recently doubled development aid in the niger
"furthermore, schäuble stands for the communization of debt in the eurozone open borders and merkels asylum chaos constant tax increases and inaction in the fight against cold progression"
"in addition, a dam game enclosure was affected which was completely closed off"
"ladies and gentlemen, trump and the arms industry are particularly pleased about this."
he must be laughing about it himself
we need to discuss this in order to eliminate the unsatisfactory situation
the next greece bailout package coming in summer is not anticipated in any way in the budget
that alone is bad enough
the fdp publicly describes all this as a catastrophe in its campaign
all this for an ideological borderline theater that will kill the diesel and soon also the gasoline engine in order to force the citizens with low performance and low range e-cars.
all this in the oh so free tolerant germany
these are all side effects of merkel's multiculturalism which has brought us hordes of brutal rapists and murderers as well as religious fanatics into our country.
these are all facts that obviously drive you from the gender and donor parties almost insane
all this bothers them and that is the reason for their bill before us today

the foreign ministry on the bosporus rumbles the fact that despite our warnings the sign of the gray wolves the symbol of a legal political party in our country is on the same list as the pkk a bloody terrorist organization is absolutely scandalous
the bamf completely overloaded trying to implement a justified deportation
the building child benefit promotes completely arbitrarily above all where families build anyway
the bavarian cabinet has decided on the cornerstone for a digital and innovative future for our children
the bavarian police task law does not create a balance between freedom and security but it is an attack on freedom
"this means that the coal phase-out, which was negotiated in consensus with various social groups, must finally be enacted into law and implemented."
that means defending human rights every day
"this means, in particular, strengthening universities of applied sciences in terms of personnel, for example, in the mid-level faculty"
"this means that more than 320,000 people have already benefited from this regulation"
this means terror war and more people on the run
this limits the ability to invest in health care or education

the federal constitutional court has already rightly declared passages of the previous law unconstitutional on several occasions
the federal constitutional court correctly stated at the time that the scope of state funding must be limited to that which is indispensable for maintaining the parties' ability to function.
"the federal constitutional court has also stipulated that the state must not only approve this benefit but also guarantee it, i.e. it must ensure that the benefits possible under 218 stgb are not undermined or attacked."
the federal administrative court ruled this week that driving bans may be imposed in individual municipalities
the chaos in the union dispute over asylum and refugee policy was perfect
the credo of the social market economy is in doubt for freedom market and competition
that takes forever every time
the german asylum system is rotten to the core
german law is overridden the understaffed police look on helplessly
the german network is even worse than the one in albania as a study shows
this also serves the fight against organized crime and removes the breeding ground for gangs of traffickers
this serves neither our soldiers nor our security

this relieves the burden on employees and makes the health care system fairer
this relieves the burden on employees and contributes to the attractiveness of the nursing profession
"the horror of this murder should not lead to instrumentalization, for example to slander a political competitor."
this is also in line with our recent party conference resolution on this matter
this does not correspond to my understanding of a good and serious policy
the result is a dramatic increase in stress and strain
we see the result today and it is something to be proud of
this was stated today by the european court of justice
we can only achieve this with a strong european union
social benefit fraud is a problem and must be fought hard
this makes it more difficult to enforce the obligation to leave the country and is worrying because it increases the risk that rejected asylum seekers will go into hiding and stay in germany illegally on a permanent basis.
the world's first and most successful eco-label celebrates its 40th anniversary
the european parliament has further deepened the rift in the eu with its absurd show trial
the right of israel to exist is not abstract at this point it is very concrete
the experiment euro was steered in irresponsible directions
the wrong thing would be to leave the field to the right they stand for social inequality
I found this particularly impressive
Christians all over the world celebrate this every year on the 6
i honestly find that a bit absurd but of course
i find this a particular scandal
I think that's good now they are not so upset
I don't think that's a good move I have one second left and I'll stop now
I find that very beautiful
i'm glad because it's good for german craftsmanship

the law is so vaguely worded that it does not restrict or even control immigration but invites abuse and creates further incentives to immigrate here illegally
the law is to come into force in november of this year
the law restricting family reunification for subsidiary protection is bad
this gives us breathing room today for investments in the future and security for investments in social cohesion and the bottom line is that the 2019 federal budget is solid and serious dear colleagues
the spd's watering can principle is lacking in solidarity and endangers the idea of the basic pension as a whole
this also applies to your budget mr. federal minister 5826 billion euro that is a significant increase
this is also true against the background that a law is currently being discussed in the ukrainian parliament that is explicitly seen as an alternative to minsk ii
this applies to families with a maximum gross annual income of 90 000 euro
the bottom line is that this applies to all topics
"this applies not only to the unconditional basic income but also, and in particular, to migration policy."

"by the way, this also applies to the reference to the 35 million properties that need to be valued"

I have just taken this from your speech in particular
but they obviously did not
"unfortunately, they have rejected this, but it would be a new approach"
this is what we decided yesterday in a 5-point paper keeping the air clean enabling mobility
we have experienced this before and therefore we will reject your application

"the cell phone network is miserable, especially in rural regions of germany"
this also has nothing to do with tolerance or consideration of family affiliations
this is what the pension expert otto teufel has calculated
this is what the afd faction decided unanimously in its meeting today
this has historical and well comprehensible reasons
"this has nothing whatsoever to do with future policy, mr. colleague"
volker kauder made this clear once again before our group meeting
"as a result, parts of the population are struggling for physical survival."
this has nothing to do with your potemkin village mr. albani which does not exist but with what my colleague jens brandenburg has demanded a clean excellence initiative for vocational education and training and indeed excellent and not a skinny model on the catwalk as this reform now comes along
this means that the solidarity surcharge would be unconstitutional as of 2020

that means we handle this instrument very responsibly
that means we need to strengthen the unions
today's china is a threat to the free world

this is hardly to be surpassed in heuchelei and cynicism
this is also a mandatory prerequisite for our consent
this is exactly the direction we are pursuing with our application.
that is also good
this is better than calling for more and more federal funding
this is cheap and mendacious mood mongering
this is the opposite of freedom of the press
this is the big problem i have with the application
this is the package on which we hope to be able to discuss legislative initiatives in this house very soon
that's the asset we can use to grow in europe
that is the problem with the whole story
that's the problem that comes up a bit short in all these competence and subsidiarity discussions
this is the problem we have to discuss with the spd most constitutional lawyers now confirm the opinion that an arbitrary division 90 percent or
this is the problem you should be talking about
this is the topic of old-age poverty this is the topic of pensions
this is due to the political failure of the federal government in mobility policy

this is the place of discussion mr boehringer thank you very much
this is the framework for positive economic development
this is the scandal and we must prevent this in the future
this is the dream of all hardcore liberals and right wing market fetishists a europe strong enough to suppress democratic gains of the labor movement but at the same time weak enough to influence market outcomes through redistribution or industrial policy
that's the difference and the federal government should be ashamed of it
this is the real reason
this is the real scandal of your proposal
this is the context we are talking about

this is the future of mobility
this is absurd dear colleagues
this is absurd after the experiences we have made in the banking crisis
that is what is being said here we are not robbing the workers but we are making sure that the people get cheap renewable energies
this is the real situation
this is a policy that does not serve peace but stirs up conflicts
this is a shame for our country yes but he is not paid to all
this is a disgrace in one of the richest countries on earth
this is one of the big problems we have with hackback
this is completely insane
this is completely absurd
this is absurd in your policy
this is really absurd
"that's not too much to ask, dear colleagues."
that is honestly quite absurd
"this is an old pattern with the left-wing party, namely to look for a scapegoat"
this is an ambitious goal but it is also a real goal
this is an expression of the left-green hypermorality to which this institute has obviously fallen prey
this is a dam burst of inhumanity what you are organizing there
this is a model of success for the common good in our country as well
that's a pretty crude understanding of the law
this is a very important signal dear colleagues
this is a great success for a cosmopolitan modern economically successful and socially stable country
this is a great and a valuable good of this country
this is a good positive signal
this is a heartfelt concern of the spd faction says andrea nahles
this is a mockery to all employees and also to the customers who do not receive any refund at all
this is a wise suggestion that i would like to ask you to support.
this is a prime example of the failure of the groko's digital policy
this is a huge step forward
this is a bad joke and does not fight child poverty
that is very considerable progress
this is a very one-sided understanding of european solidarity
this is a scandal dear colleague heil
this is a strong sign for a world free of nuclear weapons
this is a failure of the entire house
this is a failure of a spd-led ministry
this is a completely unserious and transparent election campaign maneuver
this is a sign of respect and love for the older generation
this is clearly a consequence of the agenda 2010
this is a type of organized crime that has long needed to be regulated
"this is a considerable, indeed a gigantic sum"
this has been a humiliation which of course posed an enormous problem and stood in the way of reconciliation
this is a significant improvement
this is a dramatic development
this is a question of respect
this is a question of respect and strengthens both cohesion and the economy
this is a threat to our freedom so lindner
this is a big embarrassment
this is a big city lattemacchiatodenke that only a few can afford so christian lindner
this is a nice twisting of the facts
this is a positive development
this is a huge relief for tenants
this is a disgrace for a country as rich as germany
this is a bad development
this is a very small answer to a very big problem
this is an increase of over 40 percent compared to 2015
this is an increase of over 11 percent
this is an injustice that should be abolished
this is an unnecessary disadvantage in this case of domestic students that this creates
this is an impertinence the citizens must finally be relieved of their burdens
this is an outrage especially in view of these deaths 2019 there are homo trans inter and bisexual people who have to flee from violence and persecution in their countries of origin

that's a damn bad balance sheet
this is a mockery of the rule of law this is a mockery of its dignity and power
"this is more than unworthy of a politician, especially a vice president of the federal parliament"
this is just shabby and disgusting
this is pathetic and bad
this is the result of a major inquiry and is demonstrated not least by the current situation in brunei where homosexuals face the death penalty
this is first of all the subject or
this is something clearly positive that the afd is not even thinking about yet
this is something we deeply reject
this is fatal ladies and gentlemen
this is essential for the stability of our country ladies and gentlemen
for me this is the pinnacle of defamation of the unemployed ladies and gentlemen
for me this is the malicious destruction of the economic basis of existence of the federal republic of germany
this is an important point for us and we will continue to pursue it accordingly.
for us this is a question of respect and recognition
this is an excellent starting point for us to be able to operate soundly in the coming years as well
this is pretty pathetic ladies and gentlemen
"this is dangerous because many of them come from the judiciary, where they have been conspicuous for their complete inability to exercise political moderation."
this is money that has been taken from the people without any service being rendered in return.
this is as morally reprehensible as it is paradoxical
this is downright mockery of the german population and then with the statement that this immigration is the source of prosperity and innovation
this is fair and relieves the burden on employees and pensioners
this is fair and long overdue
this is good for the climate for employees and for the regions
this is good for our country and good for the environment
that is good and that is important
that is good and right
this is good and right for the enforcement of the digital internal market as well
this is hypocritical towards the kurds in syria
this is basically the structural problem with modernization rent increases one decides and the other pays
this is also a question of the economic viability of the regions.
this is manifested in 17 of our penal code as a fundamental principle of criminal law but also of constitutional law
this has been a relief of more than 20 billion euro in the last five years
"in the osce, this is the clear abolition of the non-interference rule"
this is long overdue in this country
"this is a real step forward, especially for innovative companies in germany that should be noted first of all ladies and gentlemen"
this is also a very good goal to strive for
that is not to be negated at all that is true
this is not an approach that lets us fall back into old times but an innovative creative approach
this is not artificial intelligence this is not intelligence at all christian lindner vs.
this is not a social but an antisocial policy
this is clearly illegal and this is clearly tax evasion under american and german law
this is anti-performance and does not prevent old-age poverty
that is ultimately somewhere grotesque
this is long overdue but the greens are blocking the federal council and have so far been spared by the union for election tactical reasons
that is not possible with us
"with respect, this is simply nonsense"
this is now just ridiculous
this is possible but the foreign financing of the mosques must be prohibited
"in my view, this is required for constitutional reasons"
"this is of course part of a successful economy, but a successful economic nation like ours also has to deal with it."
this is of course something that strengthens the occupying power of the moroccans
this is of course toxic for long-term investments
this is of course utter nonsense
this is not the truth
this is not only embarrassing and ridiculous but an undignified and hypocritical smear theater
this is not only bad but also ruled out in the coalition agreement
this is not trivial but shows that the limits of protection against threats but also the protection of our civil rights are fluid and cannot be violated unilaterally.
this is nothing other than terror against the population of those who have been living here for a long time
this is necessary as accidents have shown in recent days
now this is really a piece from the madhouse
now this is really a proposal from the mothballs
this is just grotesque
this is politics for a country of solidarity
this is politics for a country of solidarity
this is bad for the economy and for germany as a legal location
this is bad for the letter carriers bad for the customers but good for the shareholders like for example the big shareholder blackrock a super locust
this is already an older wisdom
this is already very shameful for this house
this is shabby and disgusting
this is shameful ladies and gentlemen
this is of course a free decision of every man and woman by the way
this is semantic ross deception i want to say pathetic semantic ross deception
this is scandalous finds johannes vogel in our new wordzummontag
this is to reprimand women in this country and maintain a symbolism of disapproval
this is as much as a chief physician with twenty years of professional experience earns per month
that is solid socially just and future-oriented
this is complete nonsense both economically and ecologically
this is social democratic policy for a country based on solidarity
this is social democratic policy for a country of solidarity
this is dishonest to the soldiers
this is unjust and fact is also only justice will create more security
this is unjust and antisocial and we will denounce it again and again
this is dishonest of all involved
this is our understanding of the social market economy according to the principles of ludwig erhard
this is irresponsible ladies and gentlemen
this is irresponsible and the end of the free internet as we know it today
this is unworthy of a rich society
this is unworthy and we reject it
this is perhaps the only positive thing in this tragedy
this is perhaps a very ambivalent accusation
this is complete insanity and state failure in reinculture
this is poverty dictated from above that hits germany right in the heart
this is wisdom of the grand coalition
this is really an impertinence
this is really very very sad this has been a sad day for germany
this is quite pathetic and extremely undignified
this is deeply shameful because it is about more than profiling
that is deeply hypocritical just from them
this is convenient for the industry but bad for transparency
the italian example thus reveals the failure of the federal interior minister and the federal government as a whole
this cannot seriously be your proposed solution
it can't be
I can promise you that
I can only support this unreservedly
you can't do it the way you're suggesting now
this can already be called a scandal
certainly no one can do that except maybe you
gerhard schick can do that later
we also know this from our personal experience
this is normally only known from the crisis
becoming the most child friendly country in europe
that sounds pretty social at first
that sounds quite good
that sounds very clever
the complete failure of german asylum and refugee policy is so obvious and the extent of the scandal is so great that the establishment of a committee of inquiry requires no special justification
the konradadenauerhaus says goodbye to a sunny spring weekend
kosovo is a hotspot for islamism and organized crime
that costs money
We can do this because the committees work decently.
strong growth is creating more and more secure and well-paid jobs
this boosts demand and ensures higher revenues
you can easily compensate this with what the commission has proposed
"if you like, you can find this out in a wide variety of studies and surveys."
we can understand that well
this could mean the danger of a lawsuit industry in germany through the back door
this could violate human rights under the new un directives
this could become a problem
the country does not need a standstill but a new social beginning
the country has been marked by warlike conflicts and ethnic tensions for decades but the commitment is necessary and right
the country is now stabilized
the country is economically unserious
the regional court of cologne has prohibited the constitutional protection agency from breaking the law on such a massive scale
the regional court sentenced the asylum seekers jonas m
that is we are all victims this time of foreigners and the foreigners are evil and therefore we must exclude them
we firmly reject this
the liberalebürgergeld would be the perfect solution
"dear colleagues, we want to change that now we are getting started"
this can easily be thrown out the window
this does not solve a single problem
they ruin everything
but we are doing that right now
this makes the problem abundantly clear
that doesn't make today's organizational improvements any less important
this gives courage for the fight for a social europe
This makes sense because we are looking at the entire community of need and stabilizing the living situations.
this may be completely uncontroversial on a meta-level
that ladies and gentlemen is not fair to me in terms of performance
this ladies and gentlemen is antisocial and must be stopped
this ladies and gentlemen is truly a disgrace
this ladies and gentlemen is deeply unjust
juncker is completely serious
the motive then hate and racism
the motto demo against hate and racism in the bundestag completely misses the reality and means an unacceptable discrediting of all 92 afdbundestag members
the former wine queen must also understand this
the environment must then tolerate this because it could offend their religious feelings.
this needs to be reviewed urgently
this i must say was really disgraceful and it shows the double standards of this federal government
this must be decided in transit countries
this must now finally be addressed
"for the sake of honesty, this has to be added"
the fairy tale of rising investment is still a fairy tale
this does not always result in physical attacks
this is something we must address dear colleagues
we must also prevent this
we must focus more on this in the future
this should be our common goal dear colleagues
this should actually meet with great acclaim here
I call that intellectually quite pathetic
the netzdg is a disgrace for germany
the network enforcement act is perhaps the worst made law in recent years
the network enforcement act netzdg has been in force since the beginning of the year
the new germany commented at the time counterrevolutionary uprising in china was quelled by people's liberation army
the nordstream2 project is a good opportunity to broaden german foreign policy and deepen ties with russia in the spirit of bismarck's reinsurance policy.
autopsy result proves the two sisters were brutally murdered
the victim was lucky in misfortune because a passerby happened to see what was happening and literally snatched the girl from her tormentors
the victim had to be operated on immediately
"the positive aspect is therefore inherent in the system of the proposed legislation, at least in terms of its objectives."
the problem of jihadist terror - that much we can already say today - is not a problem of refugee policy.
the problem of high rents in metropolitan areas can only be solved with more housing
the problem is what is missing
the problem is that the test bench cheated by displaying wrong emission values in theory and therefore the assessment basis for the vehicle tax was wrong.
the only problem is that it does not deliver what it promises
the only problem is that we do not learn from it in all areas
the problem does not stop at our doorstep either
the project has failed grandiosely
per capita income has doubled and productivity has even increased fourfold
the qualification bill of spd labor minister hubertus heil has now been introduced in the bundestag
this stimulates the imagination tremendously
the risk that a debtor country would then have to leave the euro would indeed become real
this is now taking bitter revenge because the permanent rescheduling measures are swallowing up several million euros
the sword of international criminal justice must continue to be supported by germany in particular
the shabby thing is that the gender ideologists now instrumentalize their fate
we rigorously reject slaughter in whatever form eughexpertebiosiegelauchfuerhalalfleisch
beautiful bremen occupies the inglorious first place nationwide when it comes to burglaries
this would be a new chance to demonstrate the economic competence of the party
this requires a modern immigration law with clear and reliable regulations
the signal to the automotive industry some have lied and cheated for all it's worth
these are all noble and wonderful federal minister heiko maas german bundestag 19
these are excesses of organized transnational international crime
this is the 87 million euro for the support of people hiv infected by blood products
these are the proposals that are being made these days not only by the left but also by social democrats and the greens.
these are things that are decidedly positive
these are things that constitute abuse
these are targeted measures to combat abuse
these are good prospects for a continued stable economy with good and secure jobs.
these are still people who are here legitimately or illegitimately for whatever reason legal or illegal
these are people who were not so lucky
these are undoubtedly difficult questions
these are problems that the federal and state governments must solve together with the unions and employers.
these are typical cases that are likely to gain in importance in the future
these are anti-constitutional forces these are your friends
these are first and foremost achievements that are strong because we are tackling them together with other states.
We owe this to the people affected
we owe this to the victims and all the people in this country
this is a total of over 37 million euros
climate protection and social justice go hand in hand for social democracy
"by the way, these are eight asian waters plus nile and niger"
the immediate clean air program only came at the end of last year
the solidarity savings bank system and the solidarity volksbank system we will defend here and you demand the abolition with the termination of the principle of mutual bank liabilities
this should also apply to the housing cooperatives i think we agree on that
this is to be achieved by introducing a special right of termination for so-called risk carriers at these banks.
"if the cdu has its way, this should continue to be the case"
we should urge this in the interest of the countries because only with foreign investment and of course the framework conditions in the countries will there be continuous dynamic development there
"the special report of the council of environmental experts shows that the course must finally be boldly set in the direction of emission-free mobility, says anton hofreiter"
we feel this very strongly in the berlin environment
this now presents us with two specific problems
the striving for freedom democracy and unity but also bitter setbacks and terrible aberrations have shaped german history especially 80 years ago with a very terrible abyss
the quest for more freedom led to the end of the gdr
this strengthens the social partnership in germany
this strengthens not only the children but the whole family
that's what bothers me about your proposal i have to say in all honesty
the pocket money of up to 381 euro per month serves the financial appreciation
this is really not suitable for a scandal
the topic of care moves people
the housing shortage is one of the most important problems we have in germany.
"I'm a little sorry about that now, but we have to name it once."
the turkish regime accuses him of terrorism but has no proof of it
the nonsensical ban on cooperation is dropped and the federal government can finally support the municipalities in modernizing schools and expanding all-day schools.
this naturally undermines trust in one's own state
the lower house has unfortunately rejected the withdrawal agreement
"the company does not dictate to employees what language they should use for their conversations, company spokesman jochen frey is quoted as saying."
the undignified spectacle you have given us in the past dr
the judgment also reveals the entire failure of the federal government
the right of associations to sue is a great achievement of civil society because it makes it possible to sue for the rights of the general public.
this improves e.g. the situation of artists enormously
this is also illustrated by the fact that the associated organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.
this deserves the support of all of us
the procedure you are doing here is just brazen
the procedure is completely transparent it is proper
the behavior of the european union and the federal government is clearly in violation of international law as human rights are brutally violated this has just been described and not only with the connivance of the european union but even with funding because in the next few years another 285 million euros are to be invested in the training of this very dubious coast guard
donald trump's behavior strains relations between europe and the usa
this is prevented by our laws which more and more often protect offenders and leave victims stunned and helpless
the ministry of defense may also spend the allocated funds beyond the budget year
the trust of the people in the social promise of the gdr at that time is therefore understandable
the administrative court granted the urgent application of the criminal
the people of the sovereign were not asked once in all this
the precautionary principle is therefore intended to ensure forward-looking action
"at that time, this was already a scandalous and dubious foreign policy position."
that was a really strong performance by tsghessen at the tvduel
this was a decisive contribution to european security
"this was a tough battle in the coalition negotiations, in which the spd ultimately prevailed"
it was a long struggle until the introduction of a statutory minimum wage
this was a successful year kick-off retreat
this was a great achievement in the struggle against the exploitation of working people
that was good and is good now because we need time to clarify difficult ethical questions.
this has been a bit uncertain in the last few days.
that was the problem all along
that was seeon19 today we celebrate the feast of the holy three kings
what you have just said here was unbearable
these were developments that were also necessary for the protection of our soldiers
what I have just presented here was somewhat sober and factual
what you are doing is unserious populist and in the result antisocial
what you say here is nonsense
what you have presented here mr. krischer was everything else relative
we reject this in the strongest possible terms
this will cause lasting damage to the image of the federal parliament and shake confidence in our democracy.
we will realize this with this law
the revival of the 1960 agreement between the federal republic and the united kingdom on social security
"this, in turn, requires intensive engagement with the countries"
I do not want to criticize that at all
but this will be a big problem in 10 or 20 years time
this will not work with a naive belief in price control alone
this will of course lead to further improvements by then
this will noticeably improve the lives of many people
germany will only succeed with the coal phase-out
this will be the task of the coalition ladies and gentlemen
"however, this is becoming increasingly unlikely thanks to his party's political offer"
this will be to the detriment of the country with continued bad air and to the detriment of the automotive industry and the cheated diesel drivers ladies and gentlemen
this will then have a positive effect on the entire district
this of course also has a positive effect on the rent level
the welfare of her loved ones was above all else for her
"the promise of prosperity in an ecological and social market economy means that all people, including future generations, and people on other continents, have fair opportunities for a good life."
they want to keep that nicely under the carpet
that would be what really pushes forward and not the donation rip-off artists and fraudsters frau weidel who pull off such things as she does
that would be germany without merkel ladies and gentlemen
that would have been the consequence
that would be the wrong answer
this would be a first and social step to improve the situation of families
that would be a fatal change of course by 180 degrees at the expense of german taxpayers
that would be a valuable hint
this would be a smart relief policy for citizens
"this would be an unacceptable approach and burden for the people, the trade and the craft industry."
that would simply be effective and above all it would be fair
"that would indeed not only not be funny, but devastating."
that would be insane because it would never be picked up by the networks
"However, this would be irresponsible towards taxpayers and contributors."
this would be 125 euros for each person and would boost purchasing power
this would represent a huge step backwards for consumer environmental and worker standards
this would reduce both noise and emissions
this would be decided anew from factual question to factual question
this shows that you have not dealt with this topic at all
this is shown by the attack at berlin's breitscheidplatz or the attacks of the nsu
this shows the patheticness of your arguments
this shows that government involvement is only sustainable if it stimulates private investment.
this shows language kills hate kills by the way not only in myanmar
but the goal remains a strong europe of cohesion and solidarity
"the goal is to create stronger growth in the eurozone through investment in innovation, especially in the weaker countries."
the goal has been achieved the commission has laid the foundation for a social consensus on a coal phase-out
the goal is not to punish those who are in need of protection
the goal can only be not to lose any more species says federal environment minister svenja schulze and formulates clear goals stop harmful subsidies use less pesticides protect the rainforest stop overfishing set up more and better protected areas
we must achieve the goal of strengthening climate science and climate research
we will still miss the target
"the twentieth anniversary virtually compels a review of the successes and weaknesses of the court's activities to date, which, with its universal jurisdiction, makes an extremely ambitious claim"
The second problem is that those who receive funding do not get enough bafög.
"However, this does not change the fact that social long-term care insurance is not fully comprehensive insurance."
the will to exist of the germans as a people is to be broken
I honestly didn't even notice that it says upoloadfilter
that one did not serve the other well the diplomatic way had quite a few potholes it worked out anyway
that this is a difficult situation that this is a dilemma that we can see right now
that this is possible in a constitutional state is and remains a scandal
that the kosovar parliament has passed a law granting financial compensation to women victims of sexualized violence michael kuffer german bundestag 19
that this will not happen again is the merit of this great peace project europe
that this is so is due to the failure of the federal government
that the european idea is strong and convincing
the fact that social abuse and illegal employment are being tackled today is a good sign because both are ultimately anti-social
that the tone today is more aggressive and rougher she has made sure of that
that the one who works gets noticeably more than the one who does not work
i can understand very well that the relatives of the victims are angry about it
that the poor did not think of it themselves
the fact that spending is rising is not even a bad sign
it is outrageous that the federal minister of justice is now threatening the employers through the flower
that the german armed forces are growing again is an outright lie
"the fact that the development has been negative is shown, for example, by the website of the care association in my constituency"
the fact that the eu already fulfilled the old tasks poorly or not at all apparently does not bother anyone
that the faction of alliance 90 the greens introduces such a motion is their right but it would have been good style if this would have happened at a time when women do not have the challenge of having to reconcile family and career once again in a cumbersome way
that the coalition establishes an information campaign and a subsidy program to assist in the purchase of anesthesia equipment to support small and medium sized businesses in particular
the fact that the police are partly infiltrated by these criminals has been known at the latest since the scandal surrounding the berlin police academy
the fact that the environmental utopians accept the deaths of sick people or accident victims in the worst case is of little concern to these fantasists
that this moves people is quite clear
that this is unfortunately not satire but bitter seriousness shows once again how intolerant and inhumane the hypocritical preachers of humanity and the preservation of creation have become.
the fact that this debate is taking place at all is a triumph for the afd
that these places are deliberately chosen to be unattractive seems only logical to the danes
that three opposition factions support an idea of the governing coalition that is rare in this house
"the fact that such a passage has now been included in the law is, i must say, not least thanks to our north rhine-westphalian state minister joachim stamp and the fdp parliamentary group in north rhine-westphalia, who introduced it via the bundesrat (upper house of parliament)"
the fact that an equal opportunities strategy is still a long time coming is all the more disappointing.
international comparative studies show that such a supplementation achieves positive effects.
that he would increase his criminal career was foreseeable
the further development of frontex into a european border police force is an absolutely key issue that we expressly support.
i owe my becoming an engineer in large part to him
that they were tried at all we owe especially to fritz bauer
that the 16 year old is abused for this in a certain way is obviously not interested at all
that people have to go to food banks is a political failure ladies and gentlemen
the fact that merkel did not receive any of the harassed and even raped women speaks volumes
that no one should be excluded and education is the key against poverty
"the fact that new terraced houses are now being made available to people looking for a place to live and not to local pensioners, single parents or low-income earners is nothing less than a slap in their faces."
"the fact that in addition to illegal migrants, criminals are now also storming germany puts the crown on the whole thing"
the fact that you continue to drive up real estate and rental prices with your actions is shameful
that she was pregnant marcella told him five months ago
that students are relatively not absolutely poor is therefore completely normal
Deviation from this was already possible only in special cases
"300,000 additional children and single parents are already benefiting from this"
especially those who have less income benefit from this
people who have been unemployed for a long time also profit undiminished from it
women in particular benefit from this today and in the future
"the real estate groups benefited most from this, passing on strong returns to their shareholders."
We are a long way from that in germany
of which 15 percent were from georgia 105 percent from algeria 106 percent from morocco and 025 percent from tunisia
the affected parties will benefit from this
"this would benefit people who have a relative or partner who is willing to donate, but whose donation would fail due to incompatibilities."
alice weidel afd faction leader the audacity with which asylum seekers can act in the meantime is hard to believe
"this requires qualified immigration, not unplanned and unrestrained immigration without education dr"
for this you need an ornithological expert opinion.
for this we need the stasi documentation authority a memorial for the victims of communist tyranny research institutions contemporary witnesses the support of the victims and their associations as well as commemorative events
for this we need a strong europe and a strong european parliament
we need the courage to reform and new impulses to do so.
this requires a rapid initiation of the coal phase-out an acceleration of the energy turnaround and more speed in the transition to sustainable mobility
"in addition, a europe-wide financial transaction tax and an end to austerity measures in the federal government"
"to this end, i declare that i oppose this bill"
this includes the recognition of life's achievements and effective protection against old-age poverty
this includes deployable forces to protect our lives in freedom security and prosperity
this includes elearning media competence development of innovative and new learning processes
"this includes structural reforms to strengthen germany's competitiveness as a business location, which must focus on innovation, digitization and significant tax and duty reductions."
"this also includes investing in future-oriented industries in these countries, namely in modern agriculture, in the it sector and in the energy sector."
this also includes finally banning glyphosate in the eu
this also includes that the bafög must finally support lifelong learning
this includes cohesion instead of division and tolerance instead of exclusion
this includes fighting against state decay
this includes in particular an end to violence
this does not include the protection of social democracy this may correspond to their bismarckian ideas but not to our federal republican legal system
"in addition, trump's unilateral termination of the iran deal in violation of international law not only endangers the stability of iran but also raises fears of nuclear armament in the middle east."
"martin schulz today the holocaust teaches us that ideology, hatred and incitement can lead to murder in the millions"
We have to say that this is a good thing
"to this end, violations must be better detected and sanctioned"
we don't have to light a candle here all the time and thank them for that
i say this is the darkest middle ages 2 0 made by fdp
"alexander gauland, chairman of the afd parliamentary group in the german parliament, says that schäuble's comments are an outrage and a slap in the face of all right-thinking citizens."
vice chairman of the union parliamentary group stephan harbarth gives michael grossebrömer a clear edge in the bundestag the horrific crime in chemnitz must be solved and the perpetrators brought to justice
to this from me a sincere chapeau
"i would also like to say that in the last six years we have had over 100,000 immigrants in germany via the bluecard"
"despite all the reforms, there is still too little in between"
youreurope we congratulate our bavarian state minister of justice winfried bausback on his honorary day oisguade
"the asylum seeker is accused of, among other things, attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm"
"One group has too few investments, the other too many."
This must be decisively counteracted
this must be resolutely countered
the door is thus opened to the social abuse of crime and terrorism
preceded by stalking with sending nude pictures and blackmail to the brink of a nervous breakdown
this was preceded by numerous failed attempts at a recount in all voting districts
we will agree to the proposal for referral to the committee
"on the other hand, media that report positively on migration should be promoted."
"on the other hand, the frantic clinging to the old special distribution channels does not do justice to an improvement in supply"

I will show the whole nonsense with two examples
"minister of the interior seehofer takes the biggest tumble, with only 16 percent approval"
"as the cdc sub-parliamentary group, we will reject the motion of the left-wing fraction presented here."
the potash miners have unfortunately lost the fight for their work
the small woman had to be stitched up in the hospital
she clearly rejected the plans of french president emmanuel macron macron is a loose cannon in his own country and his answer to criticism of the european union is more european union more bureaucracy more authorities
"further improving the protection of our forces therefore remains a central task for the future federal government, emphasizes hesse's interior minister peter beuth articlepolizistenbesserschuetzenstraftateneffektivaufklaeren"
"subsidiary or limited protection status is granted to refugees who do not qualify for protection under either the german asylum law or the geneva refugee convention, but who nevertheless claim that they are at risk of death, torture or other inhumane treatment in their home country."
the syrians there are not threatened with torture or inhuman or even degrading treatment or punishment

here is the problem we need to solve
here the retention of the apartment is certainly a reasonable motivation
"here, politics is called upon to provide the necessary framework conditions, because only in this way can the entire market benefit from healthy market participants."
nothing is planned here
nothing can be salvaged here trust has been squandered
"however, to speak of upgrading here is gross nonsense"

here the appeal must go above all to the countries
the group from which the majority of violent problem pupils come must be honestly addressed here.
here must be developed or sold
"here, of course, relentless and complete clarification must be carried out"
here must actually be helped and supported
here we must increase the share immensely
here we must consider how to strengthen the back of those affected
saying no here is not excessive caution but common sense
here the employers and the facilities are more challenged
"this is a challenge for the platform operators, says christian lindner"
This is a challenge for the municipalities in particular
here we should finally mention one thing the violence against white farmers
here kfor continues to stabilize and support

here not even the ridiculous minimum standards of course target language level b1 are reached
real capacities are now freed up to finally protect the eu's external borders

provocation is being used here but no factual work is being done by the far right
here is made mood after the motto come all to germany no matter how many you are no matter for what reasons no matter what it costs the taxpayer

"if we had corporate criminal law, first of all fines would be possible in proportion to the economic strength of the companies secondly, the public prosecutor's office would have to investigate and thirdly, in the case of systematic criminal behavior on the part of a company, more than just a fine would be possible, such as the withdrawal of licenses or even operating restrictions"
so it's high time to tackle the really big problems the gender-appropriate choice of words
"to put it politely, this is very weird dear colleagues"
please stop this is frankly absurd
finally stop this support for the war in yemen
stop this mendacity
sounds great but will not work in real life
"i strongly appeal to the egyptian government to exert its influence on those in the country who may be influenced by it, but who may not yet subscribe to the unity government's policy, so that there may be an improvement in libya's internal situation."
i thank you very much for your attention
thank you for the congratulations
I thank you very much
i am grateful that i was allowed to contribute a small part to this as well
i am grateful for everyone who is committed to our democracy
i am convinced with this legal framework with the right mindset with the creative security solutions of startups in the it security field we will get a dynamic it security architecture for our country
"i believe that if you want to use data intelligently and in compliance with the law, you need the expertise to do so in-house."
i am a human being with weaknesses for which i personally cannot do anything
i am in favor of technology openness to make climate protection efficient
i am quite sure that this will be a good measure to live well together in a free but peaceful germany
i am already in favor of asking how the net beneficiary countries are performing not only in terms of distributing asylum seekers but also in terms of complying with the principles of the rule of law
i am very surprised that the federal ministry of transport is even fueling this debate
i am very grateful that you have addressed the eunitratmessstellennetz
i am skeptical about this attitude towards the basic law
i am proud of our basic law
i therefore request your approval
i ask for your support for this
i sincerely ask you to support the federal government
"but above all, i would also like to thank the politicians who have supported us."
I would like to sincerely thank all those who have contributed to this project.
i also thank the fdp for clearly standing by this responsibility
thank you for your attention
thank you for your attention
i thank you for this also in the name of a cool troop that is the german armed forces
thank you for your attention
thank you for your attention
i thank you very much for your attention

thank you very much for your attention
thank you very much for this question
thank you and have a nice weekend as well
i thank the previous speaker for this argument
i would like to sincerely thank wolfgang gerhardt for his work in various top positions with the free democrats so christian lindner
i also think the african union has a greater role to play in this conflict
i think that we must not lose sight of these basic structures
i think that after one and a quarter years we can definitely draw a positive balance sheet
i think we owe them an answer
i think there is consensus on the fact that terrible crimes against humanity have been committed in syria in recent years
i think there is no reason for complacency at all
i think we need to get out of cloud cuckoo land and be honest with people
i recommend that everyone not see this as so threatening
i recall here the breitscheidplatz attack and the role of the gtaz
i also remember the 2017 election campaign well
I expect you to nurture and care for them.
i expect the federal government to take preventive action here
i expect a deputy to be able to deal with himself and with the contents that he can take note of here listen to the call of the deputy
i found mr. bushman's answer very clever and very fine
i'll summarize this 48-word worm for you refugees and host societies must adapt to each other
"i think that's where we should start, too, and introduce funding guidelines specifically for women."
I find this absolutely regrettable
i find this outrageous mr. hofreiter
I think that is quite transparent and very well comprehensible
i think this is a great success from which the economy benefits and from which the employees benefit as well.
I think this is a really bad deal
I think that is a shame
i think that is nothing to be proud of ladies and gentlemen
i find this inhumane and shameful
i find this unbearable and comprehensive relief is urgently needed here
I find this really exasperating
i think this strategy is outstanding
i find the submitted report excellent
i find it regrettable and devastating for germany that the union under angela merkel has lost its economic policy compass
i think it is good that we are discussing this again and with vehemence
I think it is a shame
I find it very good that you also say quality before quantity
i think especially in such turbulent times like these this is an important sign
i think this government and therefore also this coalition is making a fool of itself here
I think we need to discuss the problem here
i think we have to disagree with regard to the hearing we had when the fdp motion says the fight against cannabis use through repression has failed
i ask the minister in charge they have not spent the money they have received in the last two years
i wonder how long we can continue to reward this mismanagement with taxpayers' money
i ask you do you still stand by the demand to fire this employee
i ask you what is the situation like where there is increasing unrest civil wars conflicts
i ask you how many so-called suspects have been abducted and murdered in such raids?
i am also pleased that we have once again been able to establish a satisfactory legal situation for new MW plants in the range from 1 to 10 mw.
i am also happy about your support and the support of the cducsu that we can invest in the kitabehereich
i look forward to working on the committee
i look forward to the committee meeting
i look forward to the debate
i look forward to the discussion
i look forward to the discussion in the finance committee
i look forward to the budget discussions we will have twice this year
i look forward to working with you
i am pleased that civic engagement and initiative are now also being formed in leipzig and that people are also thinking about this there.
i am pleased that the oda quota is picking up speed again and hope that it is heading for the 07 percent mark
i am pleased that this social change has simply swept away parts of the house
i am pleased that merz is taking up an old demand of the afd faction
i am already looking forward to hopefully breaking ground then
i look forward to seeing you leave this parliament at some point too
i look forward to your full support in the coming weeks in the budget negotiations and later in the joint work dear colleagues
i sometimes feel ashamed to hear such völkisch and defamatory talk in parliament and that is why we have to talk about it today as well
I fear they mean the same center
i think we in bavaria are also very good at politics
i think the minister did that impressively
i believe this is an expression of democracy in europe we create legal certainty that is absolutely clear and avoid unjustified disadvantages for our citizens
i think this is a real problem
i believe the signal is important that the state fights on equal footing with criminals
i think this would be a very bad division of labor
i believe that constant scandalization does not help at all
i believe that one should not succumb to the fallacy of weakening oneself
i believe insect control is a problem that needs to be addressed much more broadly
i think this is a good development and this is exactly what we want to strengthen
i think this wish unites all of us in this house
i think a little humility is indicated when you say let the planned economy not that we don't agree that we don't need a planned economy but only the market can't fix it
i believe it is nothing new that citizens rightly expect answers to very specific questions from us as parliamentarians in the german bundestag
i think it is very gratifying that vocational training is becoming an increasingly important part of the european union's education policy initiatives.
i think it is worth investing in these points power energy and money before thinking about something completely new
i think it will be important in the coming weeks and months to move forward a little more quickly
"i believe that powerful action does not have to go hand in hand with speed because it has to be well thought out, sustainable and legally secure"
i don't think it should be said that the grand coalition has done nothing on the subject of pay equity on the subject of reconciling family and career on the subject of pensions
i think you need to make a brief intervention that shows the complete mendacity of the debate
I now have considerable doubts about this
"i didn't quite understand it at first, but i now realize that they still offer services for lobbyists"
"i suspect, mr gauland, that your policy against an orderly refugee policy is actually designed to keep this problem from being solved so that you can continue to fish for your brown votes in this swamp of fear and disorder"
i have seen the fear of people who had to fear not only for their possessions but also for their hereditary property in the broadest sense who were afraid that their children would not remain healthy
i just wanted to add a praise to the green party and the fdp since they have jointly approached the chancellor to make the constitutional amendment possible
i said it earlier we are here as representatives of the german people
i spoke to the bereaved and the injured yesterday
i have demanded here year after year like a broken record again and again that something must happen there
i have high respect for women who choose family and education
i learned english at school
I did not say that this is illegal in this sense.
i never heard my parents complain that we were poor
i was happy when i saw positive signs
"i was wondering, for example, what you actually mean by enabling innovation"
i have listened to arguments pro and con have had many discussions
i have additionally looked at how the results of this study were determined
i have not the slightest understanding for this inaction of the ministry
i have respect for the separation of powers
i still haven't heard any suggestion from you on how to help people infected with hiv or suffering from aids
i have been thinking about what pension policy proposals you as the fdp actually have
i think this is an absurd procedure
i think this is a scandal
i consider this to be grossly unconstitutional
I think this is scandalous
i consider this unconstitutional
"i think the sequence we have found is sensible and i think that with the initially milder means of the order we have found a good way of enforcing the regulation in the interests of the customers, especially with regard to smaller providers, without burdening the business models with excessive fees due to the threat of fines."
I think it would be helpful to quote this again here
"i think it is imperative that the eib is not only more closely controlled by the board of directors, but that it also pays more attention to inefficiencies in the investments it makes in europe and tries to avoid them."
i don't believe in demonizing private institutions all the time
i had the pleasure of being one of three members of the german parliament to take part in the trip that foreign minister maas has already mentioned here
i had a great time there they are great people
"i had said, like others, that the abuse of child support should be curbed"
i hope for a more qualified debate tonight about 219a
i hope that a positive way of approaching this issue will be found here as well
i hope this does not happen in other areas
i hope that reasonable forces will soon prevail again in our beautiful germany
i hope you will go along with it ladies and gentlemen
i hope that such clear announcements will come to the railroads
i hope that many people will follow this solution and support it
i hope that we can also convince the coalition partner then
i hope that we can find a common answer here then
i only hope that lindner remains firm in this matter and does not fall over
i hope and assume that this commission will be equal to its important task
I hope we can get him together
I would also have liked to have it yesterday
i keep hearing the word noncommittal from the members of the coalition factions while on the other hand i hear that standards are being set and that there is to be some international order i also hear targets here again i ask myself a question that is also asked by millions of people outside in this country
i can only make the statement to our british friends do not make a mistake
i can only say that when you have a discussion like this you have to be able to show that you are working with a certain competence and strength.
i can then compensate for the effect but i cannot abolish the cold progression
I can tell you yes that is exactly what happened we looked at it the help got where we wanted it to go
i can tell you with this strategy we will meet the limits again and create both protect consumer rights protect the people you always quoted who have little money protect and protect health
i can imagine how terrible this is for the family
i cannot understand how one can be against such agreements
I can only say that with this kind of cheese you don't get any further in the question that is at stake here
i can only say have fun with the discussion with the countries
i return to the pedagogical principle of repetition nice that at least this one sentence violence is not a means of confrontation seems to be quite consensual
so i come back to what i said in the beginning there is no healthy and unhealthy food per se but there is an unhealthy diet an unhealthy lifestyle
perhaps i'll get to the heart of the problem
I come back to the topic
i criticize a little in the first period as a backbencher admittedly fruitful and unsuccessful the decline of the schengen border code in europe
i have been fighting for 20 years to get orderly immigration to germany
I could kill you all
i invite you to support me on this way
i mean the program demokratie leben that works against misanthropy and racism
i think that further considerations should be made in this direction in order to come to a reasonable compromise before we continue to throw the same arguments at each other.
i mean the embarrassing event in chemnitz
i mean not only the federal government has significantly improved its revenues
"unfortunately, i must once again refer to the afd faction so that at least those who are listening are clear about the situation"
i must say in all honesty that we are grateful and also proud that we are able to provide this service
i must say in all honesty as i was the de deutsche bundestag 19
"I must also tell you that with what we are now in a position to solve, simply shrugging our shoulders to accept that in the meantime other female doctors are being sentenced is already crass"
i must tell you i find this distasteful
i must say this is really a strong piece
i must say there is a telltale phrase in the application
i must say that was a bit impressive for me
but i would like to point out that being poor in germany does not mean a lack of basic services
i would like to mention the fight against species extinction in the first place
"i would also like to remind you once again that we can no longer hide behind our closest partner, the usa."
i don't want to say that we don't have to fight poverty among the elderly in germany but i think it is shabby and indecent that you play off the misery in the world against the problems we have in germany.
i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the german soldiers of this aid program
i would actually like us to implement the basic pension by the summer break
"today, i would like to express my utmost respect to the relatives of the victims of berlin's breitscheidplatz because they have mustered the strength to deal with this difficult fate"
"I would like to show you a solution, namely that we do not unilaterally denounce the actions of the west and in doing so do not in any way address the causes of the expulsion of the syrian population by the millions, the toleration of genocide and the use of chemical weapons."
i would like to live in a world where we don't have to discuss the acceptance of sexual and gender diversity because it doesn't matter what gender you are because it doesn't matter who you love and because no one has to justify their sexual or gender identity not to their neighbors not to doctors and certainly not to public authorities
I would now like to continue talking without being constantly interrupted
i don't want dead people in the mediterranean and i want us to stabilize africa
i would like to speak out in favor of giving greater consideration to queer politics
"with regard to the bamf, i would like to say that the interior committee of the german parliament has dealt with the clarification of the accusations at the bremen branch of the bamf in an excellent manner in many special sessions in the past weeks"
i want to set courage and optimism passion and confidence against skepticism and resentment so nicola beer
"I would like to comment briefly on the term ""kmube""."
I would like to encourage you to agree
I would like to know if we are taking a risk
i call this digital assistance to crime and murder
i call this deceiving voters deceiving the hardworking in our country
"i call this approach downstream bribery, and it must stop there."
"i'll give you a house number - according to the federal government's report on international cooperation in education, science and research 20142016, we are spending around 92 million euros on climate, the environment and sustainability."
i will give you just a few examples we are offering more integration courses
"as chancellor, i personally am also responsible for checking whether what we want is feasible and fits into the budget and that every project is weighed up against other projects in terms of its importance"
i personally consider this to be a kind of completely inappropriate german megalomania
i personally love green hope they find their way back to this path
I am a careful listener and I am a good listener.
i plead for an honest debate that does not build air or dream castles
I'm talking here primarily about areas such as nursing and its staffing levels.
"i am not talking about the numerous victims of the war and their relatives and survivors but about the consequences of the war in 2018, i.e. now."
at this point i also say mr. seehofer i expect from you as federal minister that you do everything that does not harm our country that you keep harm away from it
I also say very clearly that this is really a successful example of cooperation between the federal states.
i say that with a certain emphasis on the word close
I say it again very clearly violence is violence
let me put it this way the occasion for this debate is a decidedly positive one
but i also tell you my very personal my honest opinion
i tell you ladies and gentlemen what a mendacious and decadent world
i tell you why because any other solution would be much less good
I am not saying that the law is perfect
I do not say the social issue of our time because we have other issues care and many many more
i only say world trade policy that drives millions of people into misery
i am ashamed to say that we are wasting our time here with this lying proposal
i am counting on this generation because they know that adequate old-age provision and good care are a matter of decency.
i prefer to enforce this in government
I do not deny you that at all thank you very much
i come from a poor family
"I am not here to lecture you, that would be inappropriate"
i share your goal of making the consumer strong and competent in the marketplace
i mourn this morning for the people who came to christchurch for friday prayers and were so brutally and cruelly murdered
i rather suspect that whoever wants to volunteer will also find a place
i understand the fear of being fired
I am trying to present the situation as neutrally as possible in the short time available.
i from my side was and am shocked again and again
"i strongly oppose the attempts of the pro-migration and pro-immigration sections of this parliament to threaten, blackmail and slander hungary on the basis of mendacious charges"
i also know that your majority will agree with this report
I know this is bad
i know for fundamentalists and nationalists this is hard to bear
i don't know if this is political naivety or leftist arrogance
i turn to the left side of this house and say also violence against things is not a means of confrontation
i advocate that we trust ourselves and have confidence in ourselves that we can carefully and appropriately weigh up the interests that are brought to us.
i will vote for the immigration bill
i will tell you shortly what his decision was
i as well as my whole fraction abhor any kind of violence
but i also want to contribute something to the truth using the rhine valley railroad as an example
I would like to make a final comment on the subject of europe.
I will translate this freely the most important thing must be done first
I want to make this clear once again with the statistical phenomenon
i want innovation to happen here and not somewhere else in the world
I want to make it quite clear that the entire procedure is a single provocation
but i also want to tell you something
I would like to explain to our citizens exactly what this means for them.
"with permission, i will quote one sentence from it"
I wish everyone a good evening
i wish that you act in this sense that you support our policy
i wish you a pleasant read
i wish you a wonderful christmas season
i wish you merry christmas and all the best
i wish you much strength in this mourning phase
i wish us all a merry and happy christmas
i would not call myself poor even after the fact
i would be happy if all the groups in this house supported it
I would be pleased if they were widely supported
i would be ashamed to clap at something like this
i would say of course we hope that it never comes to such a case
i quote from the application
i quote from the motion people's trust in the institutions and the rules and regulations of the eu dwindled and is partly irreparably destroyed
i quote it is the failure of politics that has led to this situation
ideas for a better stronger and more efficient europe will therefore be discussed with our guests and experts at this year's freedom convention on 11
ideas and innovations need fast internet
our thanks go to him for his service at the head of the landescdu clear line cdulpt18
holding it in germany means creating positive publicity
a happy advent and christmas season to you all thank you very much for your attention
a big thank you to you not only on the dayof care
they lack the courage to initiate new projects and to cut off old pigtails
they want to attack federal presidents who take a stance against the right wing
they are not at all concerned with ending the armed conflict
they are no longer embarrassed by anything
you colleagues from the afd and fdp are not concerned with the matter at hand today
to them and all others we say thank you for this overwhelming sign
you are accused of dangerous bodily injury and bodily injury resulting in death
all of you you all made it possible in the end that from a simple letter that the
"in our view, however, your proposal has at least two weaknesses, firstly"
your proposal is once again bungling in terms of craftsmanship and nonsense in terms of substance
your german-ness you sell us is a caricature is a grimace of german-ness
your commitment to free networks free software neighborhood initiatives for the digitally disconnected in the interest of the common good deserves praise recognition and support
"your draft provides for special exemptions from the obligation to register, for example, for lawyers in the exercise of or representation of legal interests in connection with administrative or judicial proceedings"
your conclusion the world needs this strong europe that holds together and brings peace
your conclusion from the first day a great industry with an unbelievable number of creative minds
she managed to escape and is currently in hospital due to her injuries
her fight against sexual violence as a weapon of war is honored today with the nobel peace prize
your fight against sexual violence deserves all support your courage and commitment our respect
your proposed solution can be summarized very simply in the end more money
you do a great job
you should finally overcome your distrust
your failure to act is in any case criminal
your paper comes plenty late
your resignation is long overdue
your protection should be a top priority
her senseless death joins the cruel murders of girls by immigrants that have already cost mia maria mireille and others their lives
your pay will be increased to up to 80 percent of the pay of regular and professional soldiers
your text simply suggests the problem is the foreigners
her death was a great loss for the german left and the international labor movement
you deserve more time for yourselves for your projects and your dreams
your train can be controlled and prepared
your input is irreplaceable for our work
your readiness is not given

servus dear colleagues
let's put an end to injustice
let's unleash the dynamism of europe
combating sexual child abuse the cdc sub-parliamentary group is taking up the fight for more effective protection of children and young people against sexual abuse with a major package of measures
being able to prepare for this is only possible to a certain extent ladies and gentlemen
to pretend to be shocked here is simply mendacious
security means being free
security this is and remains the cdu's core competence
security is a basic need no matter what others may claim
safety is not a question that is decided at this border
security what is that for you
certainly the repeal of 522(2) zpo may lead to a greater staffing burden
they all continuously perform outstanding work with the goal of ensuring germany's security
they are all an indispensable part of a modern Bundeswehr
you work in a responsible position for the safety of passengers
they fuel the wars and create refugee causes
they justify the motion as follows solid craftsmanship is innovative trains nationwide increases the national economic power and protects consumers
you are untruthfully claiming that poor people are either excluded from public transport or criminalized
you complain day in and day out about uncontrolled migration to europe
it claims that its security is threatened by ongoing terrorist attacks from syria on the turkish border

"You are only calling for a linear adjustment, and we are in favor of that, too - I will say that again, but you have not said anything about structural reforms"
"for example, it calls for investment in ecological projects"
she does not rejoice in the injustice but rejoices in the truth
they harm them
they lead the constitutional state through the ring while the taxpayers are still condemned to finance their own threat
you began by stating that you support the proposals of mr. söder
you simply give a higher dose of a drug that has a harmful effect
you are endangering peace freedom and prosperity on our continent
they treat each other decently and fairly saxony's prime minister michael kretschmer praised them after the 4
they are part of the cultural side effects of a hair-raising and irresponsible asylum policy that ensures every day anew that its own people become fair game.
you think precaution is the opposite of innovation
they blithely interfere with freedom of speech destroy the internet
but they also have a coalition agreement and they have the strategy artificial intelligence
you have now judged the whole thing a bit confused with general superficial interjections from above
you deserve this because you are doing excellent work colleagues
they have the goal of improving the living and working conditions of seafarers
they complained about the insufficient training time and the insufficient level of training of the malian forces and then they said it was completely irresponsible that we send these forces so poorly trained into the war that is how they said it
through their policy of open borders they have ensured that such new laws are necessary in the first place
they have a program with very nice entertainment shows of all kinds
they believed they could blackmail us
they told frau them that it must be sustainable
they said they wanted to prevent divisions in the country and strengthen cohesion
you have missed the opportunity to sustainably strengthen and noticeably upgrade this socially so important area.
"incidentally, you are also wrong about the victim compensation act"
you have already admitted that you will miss the 2020 climate targets
you have every right to sympathize politically with the afd
you have my great support among others mrs. schult
you have compared the colleagues with the fans in the south curve and i say at least for the south curve of the fc bayern i rebuke this as an insult
they are simply afraid of a free and honest debate about the real problems of our country
you have such great connections in the soviet union
you have spoken of the fight against climate change against earth overheating
she does not act unseemly does not seek her advantage does not allow herself to be provoked to anger does not carry evil after her
they hate the uno as they just said
she has saved more than 1000 people from death on civilian rescue ships
she has experienced hell
she has launched a project called the permanent structured cooperation in the military field of the european union pesco and for this she was not legitimized
she said hate is simply a poison and in the end you poison yourself
she said in davos our civilization is being sacrificed for the possibility of a very small number of people continuing to make enormous amounts of money
it has approved arms exports to countries waging war in yemen
you already had the chance
it is also associated with the risk that the hedge will deteriorate
it is the coffin nail of european unity
she is the chancellor of the demise of all that was dear to us
she is more cautious in her application
it is not a social benefit but recognition
it is not static like all other factions and parties but always a little bit different
she is obviously paralyzed by fear of new elections
it is therefore an essential ingredient for stability throughout the region
she is responsible for the soldiers and often it is a matter of life and death if the equipment is not perfect

they were born as an intersex child and were therefore neither clearly male nor clearly female
they came to murder infidels and not only them but also their own muslim compatriots to torture to behead to rape women
they cost courage and sometimes also renunciation
they fought for a world of peace without exploitation and oppression
you can't seriously claim that you want to strengthen consumer protection in this way
they can acquire property they are protected by fundamental rights they enjoy all the benefits of the democratic constitutional state
you can invest your time in making a fool of yourself on these issues
you can then get upset the civil service is one of the most sought after jobs
"you can be sure that we, as the federal government, will stay on the case and continue to denounce these abuses and the violence and brutality with which the regime acts at every contact."
"you can now, as every thursday in session weeks, again excellently echauffeieren because their real goal is to put shop window applications but not to cooperate with the other groups to be able to get upset"
you could create a berlin housing allowance to really help people in need
you could also do something against the tax fugitives ladies and gentlemen
you have announced since your government declaration that you will present the draft of a bureaucracy relief law
it virtually announces the increase of the pension insurance contribution notes marco buschmann
they announced a no afdsong to be released on 12

they are destroying the expansion of renewables instead of advancing it
they are destroying their credibility more and more
they make people sacrifices on merkel's altar of welcome
it seriously presumes to drag the will of the citizens into the dirt
it must find buyers at any price even for a negative
they must go to the street because they ignore their own goals
it must be able to rely on the framework conditions created by the state
you want to fight terrorism more effectively across borders and also step up the fight against organized crime
you want to clumsily kick the new italian government in the shins
you must also have the appropriate resources
you will of course have to talk to the coaches and the unemployed to build a good system
they must finally act and stop their support for this war
they must be compatible with the eu positions
you must also ask yourself how it can be that a state government in which you are involved does something like this.
they must have linguistic as well as professional qualifications and are not allowed to immigrate to the welfare state
you must know that hate and incitement have no place in our society
they generally take far too little taxpayer money in hand for education
they take only criticizes otto fricke in the bundestag the haphazard watering can policy of olaf scholz
they sacrifice the social market economy and fuel the competition of fear
you sacrifice the future of this country
they talk about a red card for europe
they focus on workshop matters and actively participate in them
they risked their lives they lost their lives and they have gone down in history rightly so
they say that it was triggered by glyphosate and sue

they are damaging the whole thing with their dangerous ideologies and that is exactly the problem
"in our view, you are completely overshooting the mark with your draft legislation"
in your application you propose to make the identity card smartphone compatible
they brutally beat and kicked their victims
you are stirring up envy in society that is unbelievable
they see it as the solution to many of mankind's problems such as hunger and climate catastrophes and hope for curing diseases and preventing epidemics

you are very successful in acquisition
they are very happy that they are a member of nato and that we are there on the ground
you are addicted to substances or suffer from mental illnesses
they are indispensable for germany's international competitiveness
you are affected by slurry tourism

it comes from the brussels declaration for the freedom of the arts
it faces enormous challenges

you portray political office as meaningless because it costs money
they climbed over the fence armed with long knives and brutally killed the animals
they also contribute little else to a peaceful solution in this region
she wears a blue jacket and leans against a gray wall

you support our police in the face of ever new challenges
you support changes in seed legislation in african countries
"but it also illustrates, among other things, how absurdly complicated and contradictory family benefits marcus weinberg deutscher bundestag 19"

she deserves our full support portalabwdestartmemorialdeathsinuse
so you are not only trivializing the genocide of the armenians

they obfuscate the real problems
you fail to mention that additional jobs will be created as a result of demographic change
you have been assuring citizens for months that you would take their fears and concerns about good care seriously
you promise to use the contribution increases for better salaries in nursing care

"as horrible as the crimes against our women and children, which are soon to be committed on a daily basis, are, the intention of the government majority to put a shameless increase in partial state funding of the parties on the agenda today in order to push it through as unobserved as possible is outrageous"
