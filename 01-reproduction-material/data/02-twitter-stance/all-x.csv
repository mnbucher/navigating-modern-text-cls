"All Kavanaugh had to do to protect himself was behave like a gentleman, and Record all encounters with females throughout his life on VHS tape. Convert daily to cloud storage. Provide Senators footage of the night in question. It‚Äôs really not that hard."
All anti-democratic movements are rooted in anti-feminism. Mr. Kavanaugh is not telling the truth.
"Allow me to translate this for you. Mitch McConnell just said we don't care what any woman has to say, and we don't care about men trying to rape women, and we don't care about investigating. We only care about ourselves. "
Also investigate and prosecute those who have threatened #Kavanaugh family- i think this is also a reasonable request
"Although the Senate Judiciary Committee won‚Äôt allow Dr. Ford to call any witnesses and the FBI won‚Äôt investigate her claims, she‚Äôll testify about her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual misconduct next week. Dr. Ford has more balls than all GOP senators put together!"

"And I also remind you, that if ‚Äúthey‚Äôre operatives‚Äù is the only thing you say about this video and not also ‚Äúbut 70% of Republican women still support Kavanaugh‚Äù then you are missing the danger of white women‚Äôs allegiance to white supremacy and patriarchy. Those women hurt us all"
And I want a female lawyer to ask the questions. So the Left cannot scream bullying. That is why her lawyer wanted no female lawyer. The optics is what they are playing for. And those Democrat Senators better not interrupt Kavanaugh with their clown insults again. 
"And she will have an emergency on Thursday or someone will pull a fire alarm and the hearing will be, um, postponed. Just enough to keep Kavanaugh out of the opening of the SC. Has there ever been a more transparent playing than this? No. Grassley's man card has been suspended"
"And there it is folks: ‚ÄúFord's legal team also now includes Michael Bromwich...a former federal prosecutor, inspector general for the Department of Justice and is also working on the legal team for Andrew McCabe‚Äù "
"And this account tweeted in a very similar manner, linking to the Goldwater article about Ed Whelan's false claims exonerating Kavanaugh at least 12 times... 5/ "
And we are supposed to believe that the Supreme Court will be a check on the power of the Executive Branch as intended? It appears that they now work hand in hand.
"And what about Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs wife &amp; family? Why did DiFi wait until now to bring up these allegation? She‚Äôs a corrupt, deceitful liberal hack."
"And who's fault will that be? Grassley has been MORE than accommodating, but Ford thinks the defender should go BEFORE the accuser, which is the complete opposite of due process. She is Victimizing Kavanaugh and his family."
"And, no integrity Kavanaugh is hiding behind McConnell."
"And, to be very clear, sexual assault is not a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù It is a violent dehumanization that can upend a person‚Äôs entire sense of self. It is a crime, at any age, in any condition, at any level of premeditation or intent, whether ever officially reported or not. #Kavanaugh"
Any chance reporters looking into who might be behind the Ed Whelan fiasco might also be interested in the resistance ties of those assisting Dr. Ford? 
"Anyone who reads this tweet, if falsely accused of attempted rape‚Äîmeaning you weren't in the place it was said you were and had never met your accuser‚Äîwould want the authorities to investigate to clear your name Kavanaugh sits idly by as an investigation is blocked Ponder that"

"As I read the horrible stories of women courageously sharing their painful experiences of sexual assault as young girls, I am increasingly convinced Grassley, Kavanaugh &amp; the GOP Judiciary have no idea of the power and anger they are unleashing."
"As I told you, the Democrats are preparing to roll out more fake accusers to stop Judge Kavanaugh "
"As Politico's report makes clear, the attorney for Ford, Rita Katz, has only agreed to 'continue negotiating' for her client to come in &amp; give testimony some time 'next week'. This is not agreeing to a Monday hearing. "
"As Republicans were accusing Dems of weaponizing sexual assault accusations, the GOP was working with a right-wing PR firm to fabricate &amp; peddle a false narrative implicating an innocent person to take the heat off Kavanaugh. so yea. this is how disinformation operations work."
"As long as men with accusations, trump, kavanaugh etc, face no real consequences (neither are in jail and still have jobs) and women who come forward get treated like trash (death threats) I will stand up for the victim. They clearly need it more."
"As per Kavanaugh issue: I, and many others, have been assured that this is a hill that McConnell is more than willing to die on...and he doesn‚Äôt care how many he has to take with him to get it done. Grassley staffers are confident. Everyone should enjoy their weekend."
"As reporters have investigated Kavanaugh‚Äôs high-school years, many alumni have expressed fear about going on the record and alienating themselves from a close-knit community. #MeToo #StopKavanaugh"
"As we talk this weekend, let's be clear about what so many of the bad-faith defenses of Kavanaugh are really defending: "
"Ask yourself, do guys that belong to secret societies like this in college ever completely change their attitudes about women? Did Kavanaugh? Certainly worth investigating. "
"Attempted rape is still a crime. One or both parties being drunk has no bearing on the fact that it's a crime. one would think every lawyer, judge and any candidate for Supreme Court Justice would know that. Boys do stuff sometimes is not a defense. It's not even an excuse. "
"Attorney for Dr. Ford‚Äôs ‚Äòlifelong friend‚Äô Simply put, Walsh said, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford. "

Christine Blasey Ford says that she will only testify if Kavanaugh agrees to testify first. Does she just not understand how the judicial system works? How is it possible for Kavanaugh to testify first when she's the one accusing him?
Christine Blasey Ford signed Lettter in ACLU lawsuit against President Trump 
"Christine Blasey Ford waited roughly... 35 years 420 months 12,775 days 306,600 hours 18,396,000 minutes Before she came forward just 7 days before the SCOTUS vote of Kavanaugh. She‚Äôs a RADICAL resister with 0 evidence &amp; the only 2 eye witnesses deny it. But it‚Äôs not a setup?"
Christine Blasey Ford's classmate and female eyewitness actually denies any and all knowledge of the events and says she doesn't even know Brett Kavanaugh. - 
"Christine Blasey Ford, according to , feared that Brett Kavanaugh would be nominated for the Supreme Court from the day that Trump was elected. When he eventually was, her husband says that she considered moving out the country. "

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford made the courageous decision to come forward with her story of sexual assault by now-Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. We stand with her. We #BelieveSurvivors. #MeToo 
"Dr. Christine Ford noticed Sunday morning, even before her name was made public, that Ed Whelan appeared to be seeking information about her. ‚Ä¶ "
"Dr. Ford considered leaving the country when she first thought Kavanaugh would be nominated to SCOTUS. She was like, 'I can't deal with this. If he becomes the nominee, then I'm moving to another country, her husband said. She wanted out. "
"Dr. Ford has agreed to testify her first-hand knowledge to the Senate, but and the are saying I don't know how to interpret this. It's because it's in #English. Not in the form of a Trump word salad. "
Dr. Ford noticed‚Äîbefore she went public‚Äîthat Ed Whelan appeared to be looking into her. Ford emailed a friend Sunday that Whelan looked at her LinkedIn. The email was sent 90 mins after WaPo shared her name with the WH but hours before her story was out. 
Dr. Ford should proceed immediately to the authorities in Maryland and file charges making Kavanaugh the first Supreme Court Justice indicted for a crime BEFORE assuming office 
Dr. Ford will testify that there were 4 people at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her. All 4 have released statements. Not a single person supports Ford‚Äôs story. ‚ùå Mark Judge ‚ùå Patrick J. Smyth ‚ùå Leland Ingham Keyser(Ford‚Äôs lifelong friend) ‚ùå Brett Kavanaugh
"Dr. Ford's attorneys have telegraphed that if she cannot testify under their ridiculous terms, she may air a televised interview about her ordeal. Brilliant move designed to bury this insidious group of old white monsters hell bent on confirmation of Kavanaugh."
"Dr. Ford's lawyer now says the party happened 30 years ago? Ford is 51, which would mean, according to her lawyer's new statement, that the party happened when she was 21 ‚Äî which is not high school. This comment from the lawyer is sloppy at best: "
"Dr. Fraud's story is that that there were 4 people at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her. 1) Brett Kavanaugh 2) Mark Judge 3) Patrick J. Smyth 4) Leland Ingham Keyser ALL 4 have now denied there was any such party. Meanwhile, Dr. Fraud is $400k richer."
"Dude if the GOP manages to confirm Kavanaugh before midterm elections, the Democrats are going to lose any chance they have of a blue wave. Period. They‚Äôve made such a big deal of this that a defeat on either side will be incredibly demoralizing"
"Dude, we can read this. It‚Äôs not a private text. U have no zero interest in DrFord. If u did you‚Äôd insist FBI do a character investigation on both. U want to push thru Kavanaugh who CHOSE to join one of Yale‚Äôs brotherhood clubs known by their motto ‚ÄúNo means yes, Yes means anal.‚Äù"

Ed Whelan needed to hire an entire PR firm to help him fail at social media when I've been doing it all by myself for seven years.

"Ed, i think it would behoove you to address the questions of whether you worked with Kavanaugh, the White House or others prepping him (including those on the Hill) in coming up with your theory."
Editor in chief of Lawfare says burden of proof is on the accused. And these are the ppl who are supposedly saving the rule of law from Donald Trump. 
"Either she wants to tell her story or not. She needs to stop with all the demands and conditions and bullshit. If she doesn‚Äôt want to testify she doesn‚Äôt have to, but picking a Supreme Court Justice isn‚Äôt about one woman. End of story."
"Elite men like Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump get off with a slap on the wrist, while young drug dealers and car thieves sit in jail ‚Äî and the system needs to change, writes Matt Yglesias. "

"Everything that is being said about the advice I give to students applying to Brett Kavanaugh -- or any judge -- is outrageous, 100% false... Yale lawprof Amy Chau calls bullshit on the Kav rumors. "
Exactly ... Screw the &amp; the whole GOP Juciciary group! Dr. Ford should file charges in MD. &amp; let Kavanaugh face the charges in court. MD says they'll investigate if she files. Let them put him on SCOTUS during it all. 
Exactly. The minimum ‚Äúcharacter &amp; fitness‚Äù standard for a seat on the Supreme Court should be far above what would escape criminal or civil liability. 
Excellent synopsis &amp; timeline of Christine Ford &amp; Demonrats attempt to DERAIL Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation to the SUpreme Court. Democrats demanded the accuser be heard. REPUBLICANS AGREED &amp; the goalposts moved &amp; moved &amp; moved-always AWAY from a vote! 
FACTOID: Among the myriad possible reasons 15-yr-old Chrissy might‚Äôve been *especially* reluctant to call the Montgomery County prosecutors: Kavanaugh‚Äôs mother was apparently among those prosecutors at the time of 17-yr-old Brett‚Äôs alleged assault.

Ford provided 5 people who she says can corroborate her story. Smyth: Denies it under penalty of perjury. Judge: Denies it under penalty of perjury. Kavanaugh: Denies it under penalty of perjury. Keyser: Denies it under penalty of perjury. Ford: Refuses to testify under oath.
Ford wants to testify Thurs b/c that will guarantee Kavanaugh can't be seated Oct 1st. This would likely mean he may not be confirmed at all and Dems can run on saving a SCOTUS SEAT. If the Republican leadership allows this travesty the base will erupt in anger.

Ford's lawyer just 'accepted' Grassley's terms but 'asked' for a Thursday hearing. Which means she really rejected the Monday date. Say hello Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday.

"He is a liar, a gambler, a misogynist, a Republican operative. He thinks a president can't even be investigated. (As John Dean pointed out, POTUS could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and Kavanaugh says we shouldn't investigate a sitting pres.) Also, where did his money come from?"
He lied. Under oath. Kavanaugh lied under oath. He is disqualified as a Supreme Court Justice on that fact alone. Our entire judicial system is based on truthful testimony under oath. 
He reportedly works at the same sleazy PR firm that colluded with Whelan on the evil twin theory. Other clients: the Judicial Crisis Network and the Federalist Society. 
"He violates every one of my rules ‚Äî huge debt, buying a house he can‚Äôt afford, borrowing against 401k, buying tickets and country club fees that he can‚Äôt afford ‚Äînot what a Supreme Court justice should be doing "

"Hearing that the other woman at the alleged party (the one missing witness, as identified by the accuser) has come forward &amp; says she doesn‚Äôt know Kavanaugh &amp; has no recollection of attending any party that he did. Four alleged witnesses. All four do not corroborate her story."

Huffington Post Poll Shows Few Believe Kavanaugh‚Äôs Accuser Is Credible 
Hundreds of women have praised Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs character and integrity. Dozens of them gathered today to tell their stories of the man they‚Äôve known for years. 
Hysterical! CNN interview goes awry when women defend Brett Kavanaugh! 
I 100% do NOT believe Judge Kavanaugh played any part in this. Far too many questionable connections she is tied to but I do question what was sooooo devastating about what she claims happened that 36 yrs later she needs therapy dogs &amp; counseling? She wasn‚Äôt hurt or raped
"I Believe the Supreme Court should be a  BALANCED &amp; FAIR. Group of People, So Many Liberals, Conservatives and Moderates. More Point of Views and Ideas could be Discussed. Trump &amp; Co. Want every Decision to Be Decided on How Their Desires &amp; Beliefs"

I agree 100%. I'd add that MEN who believe that women's rights are human rights should find Kavanaugh unconditionally unacceptable. 
I agree. I worked with the abused in many areas. About repression memoires. They always remember how they got out of the situation &amp; there's more. I'm speaking about all of the victims that I tried to help. Ford is a lier. Here's another setup by #Democrats #MAGA #Kavanaugh 
I am going to remind you and all of what I said weeks ago. You are hanging your hat on Kavanaugh and you YOURSELVES haven‚Äôt read his records because they aren‚Äôt available. Is this the man you want to stake your political careers on?
I am so uninspired to vote in the mid-terms after seeing this pathetic performance by Chuck 'The Cuck' Grassley and the rest of these boneheads during the Kavanaugh nomination process
I am still vexed why zero decent MSM reporter continue to ignore the obvious newsworthy story here purchased the kavanaugh domain in Feb 2017 a full 9 months BEFORE Trump added his name to the scotus list 
"I believe Kavanaugh attempted to rape Dr. Ford in high school. No matter what the result of their testimony, I hope Democrats and good Repubs in the senate remember Kavanaugh would reverse Roe V Wade, believes people can be fired for being LGBT &amp; he lied under oath several times."
I believe that my Father in Heaven is going to stand up for my President's pick for Supreme Court pick. This Lady is a liar.
I can see the #resistance having Kavanaugh hauled away in handcuffs as a final act to taint his nomination.
"I cannot wait for SUPREME COUJUSTICE Kavanaugh to rule with courage, clarity, and conviction for the next 40 years Only thing stopping him is a few Republican Senators putting themselves over the country Confirm Kavanaugh to save the rule of law as we know it"
"I disagree. Two very liberal women I spoke with do not believe Christine Ford, and are disgusted by the way Democrats tried to destroy #Kavanaugh and his family. "
I don't think the majority of citizens are aware of the repercussions of appointing Kavanaugh. And if they are they seem to be very apathetic. Just from my perception of reading Twitter. Yes there are some but jeesh easily distracted. Also I don't know what happened but miss you
I dont think anyone could have predicted that a supreme court nominee was gonna get accused of attempted rape and the defense was gonna be all white people look the same
I don‚Äôt get why people thought any of these other women would recall the party or Kavanaugh in particular. None of them were the alleged victim of sexual assault. It wasn‚Äôt a traumatic event for them that would stick out in their mind. 
"I don‚Äôt want kavanaugh seated because of his behavior. I want someone who does not need to lie abt who they are. I am done with games. Honest leadership, please."
I find their attempt to blame it on someone else indicative of it happening. Why are you so completely ready to disbelieve it given everything Judge wrote about and Kavanaugh's involvement in a group well known for this kind of behavior??
I fully agree. Ford first made very general statement in 2012 when #Kavanaugh name first was raised for #SCOTUS. Why would she wait 5 years before going public on this? I want justice but it really means she has to come forward and let people look her in the eye and say him 
I had a mini melt down last night. All the bizarre news and Kavanaugh stand off is like pelting rain. Torture.
I have found that some times people find themselves in Church on sunday morning because of what they did on saturday night! kavanaugh vote
"I have known Brett Kavanaugh for 32 years, since I was 13 years old. He was the brother my sisters and I never had. We are so proud of him and his accomplishments. He is a brilliant, kind, considerate man. He does not deserve to have his good name ruined. #IStandWithBrett"
I have to ask and : Did you really let a man decide the terms of #ChristineBlaseyFord's testimony??? And I have to ask their women constituents who've been sexually assaulted: Do you really want that kind of representation? #Kavanaugh #2018Midterms
I heard someone mention if he doesn't get confirmed by October first when the supreme court start again he will have to wait for the next session and that will be after elections. If dems get Senate they will disqualify him.
I hope Dr Ford gets in touch w/ the Maryland police &amp; brings criminal charges against Kavanaugh before engaging in any other negotiations w/ the callous pitiless bullying men of the GOP Senate Judiciary Committee This is MEN trying to wield power against a WOMAN to shut her down
"I just hope that when #Kavanaugh is seated on SCOTUS, he remembers daily what Democrats and leftist activists did to him and his family."
I just love it when good things finally happen! Judge Kavanaugh will soon become SCOTUS JUSTICE Kavanaugh. The FBI/DOJ documents will be released very soon. President Trump has made America great again. LIFE IS GOOD! (Although I suspect the left is still losing their shit.)üòÇ
"I knew DemocRATS were evil but that would mean they're still human! They're monsters w/no moral compass, there's no lengths they won't go to to get their way! What they've done to Kavanaugh &amp; his family is abhorrent &amp; if that's not enough to inspire u to vote in Nov nothing will! "
I liked a video Conservatives Slut-Shaming Kavanaugh Accuser
"I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh's Georgetown Prep classmate. I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake."
"I may not have spoken @ my attempted rape, but if the boy in ninth grade who attempted to rape me on the ski trip ever decided 2 run 4 a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, I‚Äôd speak out. That‚Äôs how it can work.Actually, it works that way more than men think. "
I missed this in all the #Kavanaugh news: Prospective female clerks were groomed to have a model-like appearance. 
"I never did, . Why are you trying to normalize attempted rape? It‚Äôs NOT ok! Not for someone on the Supreme Court, not anyone. "
"I really don‚Äôt understand all of this hand-wringing about Kavanaugh‚Äôs accuser ‚Äì that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, case closed."
I see it now. This Date in History: Republican Sen. Charles Grassley caves to obstructionist left wing Sen. Charles Schumer. Allegations against Judge Kavanaugh prove to be a hoax. Democrats control Senate for 20 years until fall of socialism in 2040.
"I sincerely want Kamala Harris to ask if #kavanaugh was aware the nickname for the Truth and Courage Club was ‚ÄúTit and Clit‚Äù and ask if he was a member. Also, is he aware of the club‚Äôs reputation for shouting, ‚ÄúNo means yes‚Äù and ‚Äúyes means anal‚Äù. #QuestionsForKavanaugh"

"I swear, this story gets crazier by the second. Now the GOP spokesman for the Kavanaugh nomination has resigned in disgrace after sexual assault allegations come to light. GOP ‚Äî party of sexual predators. ‚Å¶‚Å© "
I understand the Kavanaugh is being helped by the staff ... to practice for the questioning ... On whose dime is this is this being paid for ... taxpayers?
I want to hear her. I hope u understand. 
I was sexually assaulted in the mid-80‚Äôs at the home of one of Kavanaugh‚Äôs schoolmates. The host of that party added his name to this letter to the Judiciary Committee attesting to Kavanaugh‚Äôs character. 3/ #metoo 
I will not testify here or there. I will not testify anywhere. I will not testify slow or fast. I will not do it first or last. There‚Äôs nothing more for me to say. You know I‚Äôm lying anyway. CALL HER BLUFF #Kavanaugh #ChristineBlaseyFord #ConfirmKavanaughNow
"I wonder if Ford is stalling under direction of the Dems and her lawyer to allow MSM and Dems to continue to destory the character of Kavanaugh. To the ignorant,who have already made a decision before even hearing a case.Crying Chuck comes to mindü§î Vote! "
"I would bet that irrespective of who nominated, #Democrats had a plan in place to derail the nomination and impede the President in his duties. The whole #Kavanaugh saga reads like a cheap political novella. The saddes bit is the #media aids them in every step."
"I would prefer it if Ford‚Äôs lawyers would spare us the continued lies, stalling and shenanigans- Just tell us that, for no apparent reason, the first day Blasey Ford can testify is after the last day it would be possible to have a vote on Kavanaugh"
I would wager Kavanaugh‚Äôs wife has suffered more from this the last couple weeks then Mrs. Ford has for 35 years‚ÅâÔ∏èHearing this ‚ÄúTRASH‚Äù thrown at the man you love and respect ‚ÄúHURTS‚Äù &amp; cuts deeply when you know it‚Äôs ‚ÄúFALSE‚Äù‚ÅâÔ∏è
"I'm generally a fan of and , but this is journalistic malpractice. Why is CNN painting these women as average Republican voters? "
I'm guessing that would've been enough to sink Kavanaugh. The fact that Keyser said the opposite is just as significant. 
I'm more concerned about how Judge Kavanaugh's wife and daughters feel than how Christine Ford feels. She's feeling anxiety? I would too if I was about to perjure myself in front of the whole planet.
ICYMI: üòÇüòÇüòÇ CNN Has Their Night Ruined When All-Woman Panel Says They DON‚ÄôT Believe Kavanaugh Accuser 
IF THE GOP DOESN'T GET OFF THEIR ASS AND VOTE ON KAVANAUGH - THE GOP WILL PAY PRICE IN THE MID-TERMS BY SHOWING A HUGH SIGN OF WEAKNESS AGAINST THE DEMOCRATES AND THEY SURE IN HELL ARE COUNTING ON THIS 
INVESTIGATE KAVANAUGH!

IT WAS ALL A DEMOCRAT PLOT: Christine Ford Adviser Told Democrats in July Call About Plot to Take Down Kavanaugh (AUDIO) via 
"If Brett Kavanaugh has a calendar showing his whereabouts in 1982, that means he also has all the receipts from when he was treasurer of the 100 Keg Club."
"If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he could overturn Roe v. Wade and set women‚Äôs rights back decades. I still need 548 more people to speak out before 11:59 p.m. tonight: Tell the Senate to reject Trump‚Äôs nominee!"
"If Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation is derailed, while Keith Ellison becomes the lead law enforcement officer in his state, the Republican base‚Äôs anger at the Hill Republicans for their ineptitude is going to be VOLCANIC. #Kavanaugh"
"If Christine Ford wants to do her testimony on Thursday, Confirm Kavanaugh on Monday, and have the hearing after. Anyone else agree with that? ü§îüôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
If Dr Ford was serious about her accusations against Judge K wouldn‚Äôt you think she would be anxious to tell her story? Time to end this freak show and vote in Judge Kavanaugh! #stopthenonsense #stoptheleft
"If I were Brett Kavanaugh I would be preparing to sue the living snot out of every liberal talking head, pundit, blogger, and media loon who accused him of being a rapist without either a law enforcement report, or basic evidence. #NewRules"
"If Kavanaugh Is Not Confirmed By Senate, Then We Are All Just One Accusation Away From RUIN via "
"If Kavanaugh doesn‚Äôt get through, We are going to look back and realize that Grassley‚Äôs decision here is the moment when the GOP lost its nerve, and its honor, to protect the most basic processes of fairness and allow a good man to defend himself "
"If Kavanaugh is confirmed, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan will be forced to serve alongside an attempted rapist who bullied his accuser out of an investigation so he could sit next to them on the Court, overturn their precedent and force them into a perpetual minority."
"If Kavanaugh is guilty with no proof Then, Hillary, &amp; Obama are guilty of treason THE END!"
If Kavanaugh was innocent wouldn‚Äôt you want the FBI to investigate But we know he‚Äôs not GOP just wants to put him through so Kavanaugh can save Trumps ass from whatever Crimes Mueller finds in his Investagation GOP Members are just as Corrupt as Trump No Aligance to this Country 
If Kavanaugh‚Äôs accuser had no political agenda...why did she take her complaint to politicians... instead of law enforcement?
"If a 17-year-old can be forced by the government to be responsible for carrying a pregnancy to term, surely an adult man can be expected to answer for the choices he is alleged to have made at 17. "
"If all you've got on Brett Kavanaugh is an accusation from when he was 17-years-old, and his accuser is an anti-Trump activist who won't go under oath and 'can't remember' when, where, or how anything happened, then Kavanaugh is pretty damn clean. #ConfirmKavanaugh"
"If can't even properly vet his own staff to prevent hiring sexual harassers like , how can we trust him to properly vet accused sexual assaulter Brett Kavanaugh for the highest court in the land?"
"If it is Thursday, then Senate rules dictate that Kavanaugh's name HAS TO BE WITHDRAWN! If this is done, then Dems now have a new power over Reps: accuse all of them of rape in high school! Worked twice so far; let's keep doing it. The ppl are too stupid to stop it! "
"If something Brett Kavanaugh allegedly did at 17 matters 36 years later, surely the confirmed DUI, and attempted hit and run of then 26 year old O'Rourke should matter now. Right liberals? (I won't hold my breath.)"
If the Repubs agree to this political extortion by accuser Ford they deserve what‚Äôs going to happen to them‚Äîbut Kavanaugh and the voters don‚Äôt.
"If there are no consequences for Keith Ellison, then doggone, Judge #BrettKavanaugh should be nominated to the US Supreme Court. #KeithEllisonAbuseAllegation #tcot"
"If was so victimized, why did it take 36 years to become an issue? Politics. Ignore this farce, confirm Kavanaugh and tell the Dem Babies to sit down shut up and stop being morons."
"If you are Female, believe that a person is innocent until PROVEN guilty, that 36-year-old confused memories should not be enough to destroy someone‚Äôs career, then please VOTE &amp; help Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs friends spread the #IStandWithBrett message. If you are Male, simply retweet."
"If you think this is anything other than a show, a despicable play by you Democrats to try to keep Kavanagh from the Supreme Court you‚Äôre to dumb to have an opinion. You don‚Äôt give a sh!t when the wife of Keith Ellison accuses him of domestic violence! NO! He‚Äôs a democratic"
If you want to know who Christine Blasey Ford is ‚Äî who she really is and what her life has been ‚Äî my advice is: READ THIS ARTICLE. It‚Äôs gripping and utterly believable. 
If you're concerned about the Central Park Five being wrongly convicted maybe you should stand for Kavanaugh having opportunity to hear his accuser &amp; defend himself before you declare him guilty. Trump is an abuser of women but that has nothing to do with Brent Kavanaugh.
"If you're going to make the accusation but not willing to subject yourself to questions, then you should suffer the consequence of filing a false charge. "
Im told that Jeff Flake is the only Republican causing problems for Kavanaugh. He's gone from conservative champion to roadblock.
"Imagine having corroborating witnesses to being sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, and the all male Republican judiciary members are refusing to call any of them to testify. What kind of message does this send to women in America about their value as human beings? #LastWord"
"In 2005, Judge Kavanaugh had a net worth of $91K, with $10K in the bank and $25K in credit card debt: In Feb. 2006, property records show he took out a $980K mortgage to finance the purchase of a $1,225,000 home ‚Äî indicating a down payment of $245,000. "
In any court in this land the Prosecutor always put there case first then the Defense puts there case on. Ford want Kavanaugh to go first defending himself before she accuse him. Thats not the way we do things in this Great country.
In my gut I believe FORD WILL NOT TEASTIFY. There will be a FINAL RUSE by Fords attorney that she will not testify due to a nervous breakdown. OF COURSE THIS WILL BE A PLOY AND FABRICATION TO DERAIL KAVANAUGH FROM APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT
In other words we now have evidence that ‚Äôs office was working with and others to develop the conspiracy theory that it was not Kavanaugh but a classmate. WAPO also reported Kavanaugh was looking at this strategy with aides.
"In practice runs, #Kavanaugh grew frustrated when it came to questions that dug into his private life, particularly his drinking habits &amp; his sexual proclivities. He refused to answer some questions altogether, saying they were ‚Äútoo personal.‚ÄùüôÑ "
"In the Whalen Twitter thread, which has since been deleted, Whelen suggested a conspiracy theory that Fox News even picked up. His theory suggested that an innocent man named Chris Garrett, who looked similar to Kavanaugh in high school, may have been the actual attacker... (4)"
"In today's Yale Daily News: what Brett Kavanaugh was up to back in his school days, when he belonged to a secret society known as tit and clit. Motto: No means yes. Yes means anal. "
"Insane! Former Obama WH lawyer, Kate Shaw, throws due process out the window! NYT: Kavanaugh Has No Right to Presumption of Innocence, ‚ÄòPolitics‚Äô Should Decide His Guilt Instead "
"Instead her deeply held secret, an allegation that Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were in high school, would come to dominate the headlines as the endless news cycle has pried into every corner of her life. "
"Interesting language. Republican Sen. Dean Heller described Dr. Blasey Ford's allegation against Kavanaugh as a little hiccup, goes on to say, we'll get through this and we‚Äôll get off to the races. "
Interesting that Kavanaugh seems to have a slew of former female law clerks! Any guys out there who worked for him? 
Is Anyone Doing Anything About The Threats Made Toward Kavanaugh's Wife And Daughters? via 
Is Brett Kavanaugh refusing to make an appearance and testify? He‚Äôs not the one who looks like they‚Äôre hiding 
Is Susan Collins appalled at any of the outrageous statements by her Senate Democratic colleagues? There are so many it‚Äôs hard to keep track of them. Will she call them out?

Is there ever going to come a day when Republicans stop pretending we lost the election? #Kavanaugh #Immigration #GovernmentSpending
"It appears Dems will be very busy with impeachment proceedings following mid-term election. Impeaching President Trump is priority #1. After removing the President from office, impeaching Judge Kavanaugh is priority #2. What an impressive agenda for advancing our nation."
"It feels pretty weird that a nonprofit can tell a Senate committee to hire an employee from the PR firm working for its dark money arm, and it just happens "
It is disgusting that Democrats deflect away from the evidence of Ellison's domestic violence while accusing Kavanaugh without credible proof. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #VoteDemsOut #VoteRed2018 
It is just too on the nose that the Senate Judiciary Committee adviser acting as spokesman for the Kavanaugh nomination is resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal.
It would be interesting to get on the record sharing his thoughts about Christine Blasey Ford's allegation against Kavanaugh. Some intrepid reporter should pin him down on that.
"It's a job interview, not a criminal investigation. Kavanaugh doesn't get due process for a job interview. He's a compulsive gambler, accrued massive debt paid off in unexplained ways &amp; has multiple instances of perjury while under oath. "
"It's as if the GOP knew this was going to come up, and had planned for weeks or months to create a false narrative around Ford's allegations and to frame an innocent man for Kavanaugh's crime. Why the hell would they have to do this if they were sure Kavanaugh was innocent? (12)"
"It's been 282 days since Al Franken left the Senate. is not only still in office, but has attacked victims of sexual assault and nominated an accused sexual predator to the Supreme Court. Think about that. #resist #trump #ThankYouDrFord #Metoo #WhyIDidntReport"
"It's clear, the entire Kavanaugh charade is a plan plotted by the Demoncrates months ago."
"It's interesting to compare the Kavanaugh confirmation efforts of Grassley, Hatch, and Cornyn, all of whom have done everything they can to get all the facts w/o needless delay, to those of Sasse (MIA, as usual) and Flake, who's going out of his way to help Democrats delay."
"It's notable how the Kavanaugh allegations and the responses to it, are seriously negatively tainting mainstream Republican groups involved with the nomination of judicial appointees. (1/2)"
It‚Äôs Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and they‚Äôre priority is resisting #Kavanaugh. They don‚Äôt deserve a penny. Ignoring care to lobby... a national disgrace.
"It‚Äôs a complete embarrassment that the Republicans won‚Äôt stand up to the when you KNOW this is nothing more than another desperate attempt to obstruct Kavanaugh Confirmation, you should be ashamed...Be like , GROW A PAIR &amp; CALL BS! "
"It‚Äôs been 24 years since my sexual assault but I haven‚Äôt come out and named him. If he was up for a seat on the Supreme Court though, sure as hell I‚Äôd be calling him out."
"It‚Äôs over. At this point, Ford can only be viewed as a hired gun who was charged with burning Kavanaugh down. The Democrats weaponized sexual abuse and greatly harmed legitimate victims in the process. This is a new low for the Democrats. Feinstein should face consequences. "
It‚Äôs safe to say those protesting against Kavanaugh don‚Äôt want to respond to questions about Keith Ellison‚Äôs alleged abuse of his former girlfriend. The double standards of the left includes picking and choosing the #metoo victims they want to believe. 
It‚Äôs time for Judge Kavanaugh to say he‚Äôs going to sue the shit out of everyone involved in this witch hunt.
"It‚Äôs time... To confirm Kavanaugh. No more waiting, now matter how many misguided Dem leaders scream ‚Äúbullying‚Äù. They had three months. THREE MONTHS. CONFIRM KAVANAUGH. Who else agrees?"
"I‚Äôll say this again. Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony is important. However, it seems not enough attention is being paid to Kavanaugh‚Äôs financials. Where did $60-$200 thousand in credit card debt go? Who paid it off? There is no way he can support his lifestyle on a federal judge‚Äôs salary."
I‚Äôm ashamed of the cowardly GOP senators on the judiciary committee. They‚Äôre allowing themselves to be manipulated by the looney left. #KavanaughHearings 
I‚Äôm concerned that Brett Kavanaugh and his supporters have something to hide. Why not have the FBI investigate? Why not accommodate Dr. Ford as she spends her days with the FBI dealing with death threats and protecting her family? It‚Äôs one day. Why the rush? Why the bullying?
"I‚Äôm just a simple country lawyer,* but to me, it‚Äôs a bad sign for Kavanaugh when his inner circle is dropping dimes on him to the press about how he isn‚Äôt holding up well under questioning. *Not any kind of lawyer "
"I‚Äôm officially as irritated with as I am with the Democrats and this RIDICULOUS circus around Kavanaugh. They say jump, and Chuck says, ‚ÄòHow high?‚Äô Stop caving and do your damn job. No more extensions. VOTE."
I‚Äôm quite sure every Senator has already made up their mind. In fact I‚Äôm willing to bet the Democrats made their minds up the minute the name ‚ÄúKavanaugh ‚Äúleft Trump‚Äôs mouth.
"I‚Äôm reposting on Kavanaugh‚Äôs implausible denials about knowing of Judge Kozinski‚Äôs serial sexual harassment. Many knew Kozinski‚Äôs chambers were unpleasant. But how widespread was it that he had some problem with women specifically? In my experience at YLS 19 years ago, we knew. "

JW President : ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear. Leftists are trying to blow up the Senate confirmation process with this latest attack on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. And this latest gambit is all about delaying the nomination past the midterm elections.‚Äù 
"Jeff Flake strikes again. This alleged ‚Äúconservative‚Äù is about to destroy a once-in-a-generation opportunity to turn the Supreme Court back in the direction the Constitution intended, and away from its current legislating from the bench approach. "
"Jeff Flake, who has been going along with Democrat efforts to delay testimony from Kavanaugh's accuser, is preparing to vote present on Kavanaugh when his nomination comes to a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, per sources."
Juanita Broaddrick has a great idea if Kavanaugh's accuser doesn't show up. . .

"Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don‚Äôt want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don‚Äôt matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C."
Judge Kavanaugh does not deserve the treatment he's receiving from the dems OR the GOP (Grassley). 
"Judge Kavanaugh is a man of integrity, with impeccable credentials &amp; a proven judicial philosophy. I believe Judge Brett Kavanaugh will soon be JUSTICE Brett Kavanaugh &amp; take his seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. #VVS18 "
Judge Kavanaugh needs our support
"Judge Kavanaugh, I have for the first time agreed to listen to a woman, and let her speak at a time of her choosing. The Ed Whelen thing didn't work. We have to listen to her before dismissing her. Hope you understand, it's not my normal approach. Fixed it for you! "
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs already been judged guilty by the Democrats. Kavanaugh and his lawyer have the right to face his accuser. Did you know that you can look up the Constitution on line? Do you believe Juanita Broaddrick? Is she not white enough for you?

"Lees than 8% of sexual assault claims are false. And Dr. Ford sought therapy and passed a polygraph. ‚ñ™Trump doesn't believe her ‚ñ™Hatch thinks she's mistaken ‚ñ™Graham thinks it doesn't matter ‚ñ™McConnell wants to plow thru it ‚ñ™Grassley aide, we will confirm Kavanaugh"
Leland Keyser (a ‚Äúkey witness‚Äù and Christine Blasey Ford‚Äôs lifelong friend) just said she has no recollection of ever being at the party and doesn‚Äôt know Kavanaugh. There‚Äôs no more witnesses from the party. It‚Äôs time to shut this down. #ConfirmKavanaugh
Leo is the GOP‚Äôs #darkmoney judicial puppet master. He arranged a $1 million dark money donation to ‚Äôs inauguration. Now he‚Äôs orchestrated a multimillion dollar dark money campaign to secure #Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation.
"Let me help you out. GOP has far more billionaire donors who want to keep their dirty work secret than the Dems do. So they fight tooth and nail for secrecy, as in the recent CREW case against Crossroads GPS and the FEC, in which Supreme Court recently denied a stay of order"

"Let's pause to appreciate what a complete idiot is. By releasing the 65 women say Kavanaugh is not a rapist letter within minutes of Farrow's story breaking, he proved beyond all doubt his committee sat on the allegation, and planned in advance to cover it up."
"Letter on sexual &amp; other harassment in SF appeals court where Kavanaugh clerked for his mentor, creepy Judge  Kosinski, sent 7/24 to &amp; . Letter says clerks, others want to talk, fear retribution. "
"Let‚Äôs remember she never used word sexually assalted.She said groped-clothes on. What is she trying to accomplish in this? Keep Kavanaugh from being confirmed. There‚Äôs never been any claims from college, law school, clerking,working, if he was a liberal would u say don‚Äôt confirm?"
"Let‚Äôs see if , Vichy Republican extraordinaire, speaks up about 1) Grassley‚Äôs bullying of Ford; 2) Mitch McConnell‚Äôs claim, also today, that the Kavanaugh votes, hers therefore included, are in the bag."
Let‚Äôs stop this narrative right now that #Kavanaugh was a great candidate derailed by these rape allegations. He was a garbage candidate caught in ***multiple lies*** and THEN got credibly accused of attempted rape. Ford‚Äôs accusations were just the cherry on this shit sundae.
Liberals and democrats hate Brett Kavanaugh because President Trump picked him! It‚Äôs always been only about President Trump! #ConfirmBrettKavanaugh

"Manafort is going to jail. Cohen pled. Odds are POTUS will see criminal charges. Kavanaugh is known to think sitting presidents shouldn't be tried. These hearings should not be delayed. This nominee should be withdrawn. Period. Short of that, only patriotic thing to do is vote no"
"Mark Judge was allegedly in the room when Brett Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. He says he doesn't remember it, but he's not under oath. Here's an idea for the brilliant Republican Senators: Subpoena Mark Judge now! Subpoena Mark Judge now!"

Republicans have done absolutely everything to accommodate Phony Ford. She keeps playing politics by trying to delay the confirmation of our next Supreme Court Justice. Get this crap over with and vote! She had more than enough opportunities to testify!!!
"Republicans have refused to call Mark Judge to testify, despite Dr. Ford saying he was the sole witness to her alleged sexual assault. Also, this... ‚Äò100 Kegs or Bust‚Äô: Kavanaugh friend, Mark Judge, has spent years writing about high school debauchery "
"Republicans have refused to learn anything from the Anita Hill debacle &amp; are worse now.They don't care about Dr. Ford &amp; the old farts don't believe her. Theyll let her say her piece then approve Kavanaugh. Remember, Mitch is proud that he stole Obama's pick."
"Republicans: It's terrible that a woman could ruin a man's life with a sexual assault accusation! Also Republicans: Hey--did you see Ed Whelan &amp; Garrett Ventry said it could be a different guy, not Kavanaugh, who sexually assaulted Ford? Let's blame him! Deplorable, indeed."
"Republicans‚Äô relentless, ruthless revictimizing must stop. Bullying deadlines must cease. This intimidation must be halted by Republicans speaking out. "
"Retweet if YOU See #FakeNews Making #ChristineFord a Soap Opera Drama of Lying Left in #Kavanaugh‚Äôs SCOTUS Hearings! #KavanaughConfirmation is Signed, Sealed, Delivered by Federalist Society ! #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat ! "

Romney would absolutely support Kavanaugh. He would‚Äôve nominated him if he was President. Both Collins and Murkowski call themselves Rep but vote more Dem and have been that way forever

"SENATOR, WE DON'T SEE ANY BENDING OVER BACKWARDS FOR DR. FORD AS CLAIMED. NO INVESTIGATION ALLOWED, NO WITNESSES ALLOWED, NO LIE DETECTOR FOR MR. KAVANAUGH..IT IS A SHAM AND WE SEE IT...WHAT A DISGRACE!"
SOROS the Nazi is funding Katz. The lawyer representing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs accuser is a leader in an organization that has been directly funded by George Soros‚Äôs Open Society Foundation

Sen McConnell just said he has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh. McConnell doesn't lie about that. That means the undecided Republican senators are lying. That means they will not give Dr Ford a fair hearing.
Sen Richard Blumenthal lied about serving in Vietnam. He never set foot in Vietnam but he calls the Kavanaugh nomination a stainon the Supreme Court. He is a stain on the Senate. Let's make him famous and post this all over the Internet about this lying Stolen Valor senator
"Sen. Dick Durbin says Christine Blasey Ford's openness to an investigation speaks to her efforts to try to get to the bottom of this. It's judge Kavanaugh, the Dept. of Justice and the president who have said no, there will be no investigation, he adds "

"Senator Chuck Grassley released a letter signed by 65 women who said they went to high school with Kavanaugh, and that in the 35 years they‚Äôve known him he has ‚Äúbehaved honorably and treated women with respect.‚Äù"
Senator Collins stop supporting the Evil Traitor in the WH! Vote no on Kavanaugh!

Senator Grassley is so busy ramming through judicial nominations that he doesn‚Äôt have time to mind his own shop. What a circus! Spokesman for GOP on Kavanaugh nomination resigns via 
"Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI): If Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination is withdrawn, Democrats could hold the Supreme Court seat open until after the 2020 election. "
Senator Susan Collins says she is appalled by Trump castigating Dr. Ford for her claim against Kavanaugh. Here‚Äôs the problem: too many are appalled by Trump‚Äôs tweets but accept &amp; support his policies.
"Senator calls death threats against Christine Blasey Ford witness tampering, asks why FBI won't do its job "
"Senator, she's not testifying. Her lawyers are stalling until they can find a willing stooge to make another non-disprovable charge against Kavanaugh. END THE MADNESS! VOTE MONDAY. "
Senators Maggie Hassan and Richard Blumenthal say Republicans are not acting like people who want to know what really happened to Christine Blasey Ford. 
Senior White House official responds to letter from Ford‚Äôs lawyer: ‚ÄúThis is not a yes. It's another delay after Judge Kavanaugh has agreed to testify for a week now.‚Äù Ford‚Äôs lawyer requested negotiation of ‚Äúdetails‚Äù of hearing next week. 
"Serious answer: I think they see the endgame as Kavanaugh being on the Court, the public being furious with them, but the Court stripping voting rights to the point no one can do anything about it."
"Seriously, Rocky, don't be a dumbass. Kavanaugh was drunk off his ass when he assaulted Ford in Maryland. He wasn't in Europe when he was attending Georgetown Prep. Now stop being a tool and support an FBI investigation if you want irrefutable proof that Ford is wrong."
Shame on Feinstein who sat on the letter from Ford and did not present it to the confirmation Committee. This is a Far Left Dem ploy to obstruct the confirmation of Kavanaugh who is a Constitutionalist. We know your game Diane. 
She already has her mind made up...She knows Alaskans won't be happy if she votes YES on Kavanaugh ... Her dilemma is all that dirty money she's received....Hmmm... 
She sided with Kavanaugh the other day. So there‚Äôs that...
She wants to set it up so #Kavanaugh can't defend himself! That's not the way America works! Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford lays out conditions for Senate testimony 
She's better off going into the police station in that Maryland town on Monday and getting charges filed against Kavanaugh for kidnapping and sexual assault. Then she will get the investigation and justice she deserves.
She's not going to testify. The details have yet to be worked out. Give me a break. She's not in any kind of position to be dictating terms. It's just a stalling tactic. Grassley is getting played and doesn't realize it. Sad and pathetic to watch. 
She‚Äôs still negotiating!! That‚Äôs not an acceptance!! Time‚Äôs up!! Confirm Kavanaugh!! 
"Should the fact that Ford attended wild, drunken (sometimes sexual) parties at which some of the attendees blacked out and couldn't remember what happened be part of this conversation? And why was this all scrubbed from the Internet on Monday? "
"Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford."
"Simply put...Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford. The lawyer acknowledged to CNN that Keyser is a lifelong friend of Ford's "
Since Dr. Ford‚Äôs 4 witnesses have all denied any knowledge of the party it looks like Kavanaugh has 4 new witnesses to use against Dr. Ford. #TakeTheVote #ConfirmKavanaugh
Since there is NO EVIDENCE this ever happened there should be no hearings. She can testify it happened and then what? We destroy a man‚Äôs life on her word when there is no pattern of this kind of behavior in his life? No evidence at ALL? This is insane. 
"Sir, did you mistakenly think you were sending a text message directly to Kavanaugh? This is Twitter; it goes to everyone. "
"Sir, with all due respect, you must schedule the Kavanaugh vote for Monday. You have done everything, offered everything, acquiesced to their demands, bent over BACKWARDS to NO AVAIL! It‚Äôs obvious we‚Äôre being played. Stop the nonsense and #ConfirmKavanaughNow"
Six 6 female GOP Senators. Have you read the #WhyIDidntReport tweets? How do you support Kavanaugh? I know you believe Dr. Ford. Ignore McConnell's abuse &amp; do the right thing! Please retweet. 
Skepticism towards claims against Ellison contrasts with Believe All Women narrative against Kavanaugh. #WalkAway #TheAwakening #MeToo Hypocrisy: Dems and media look other way as Keith Ellison say his accuser fabricated claims - 
"So Christine Ford agrees to 'provide her first-hand knowledge' on Brett Kavanaugh to Judiciary Committee 'next week,' provided there is 'agreement on details.' Doesn't seem like a very definitive answer. "
So I asked Kavanaugh protesters if they believe Congressman Keith Ellison's domestic violence accuser and these are some of the responses I got... YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP! #kavanaugh #KeithEllison FUll Video here: 
So a woman in California claims a Supreme Court nominee assaulted her and instead of hiring a lawyer in California she just so happens to hire a lawyer connected to the so called Resistance movement. This is all a character assassination and not credible.
So appalled that she'll vote for Kavanaugh in a heartbeat. 
"So even though Judge Kavanaugh is saying please let me testify, I want to clear my name, the Dems are gonna slow it down, ignore him telling them he wants to testify immediately and just try take away what they know is rightfully the GOPs? #ThisIsFun"
"So if men question her, it's shameful. But if those men find women to question her, it's also shameful. Got it. But I'm not sure what sort of rationality I expected from a Senator who determined Kavanaugh is guilty prior to any hearing, questioning, or investigation, either."
"So is #Kavanaugh a #Republican or a #Christian? And just to think, they won't reveal all the papers on him that covered his time in the #Bush #WhiteHouse. #Waterboard much? What about #Crucifixion? Is that worse or better than Waterboarding? #GOP #RINOs #FreedomCaucus #MAGAChumps "
So just today a GOP spokesman for Kavanaugh resigned due to sexual harassment &amp; a Trump official accused of drugging the stripper he got pregnant with a abortion pill killing the fetus. The question isn‚Äôt why women are abandoning be GOP but what will it take for men to join.
"So let me get this straight... want #kavanaugh to resign for an unproven, unsubstantiated sexual assault allegation from decades ago in high school but they hold up as the number 2 for the dem party with proof and 911 calls of abuse... #LiberalLogic"
So the Democrats are floating the idea of impeaching Kavanaugh what happened to due process of the law under the constitution and that you‚Äôre innocent until proven guilty? These people and their liberal agendas are just sick
"So the attorney for Ford is saying that Ford‚Äôs best friend, Keyser, is a liar? Keyser categorically denies ever meeting Brett Kavanaugh. She categorically denies the party ever happened. Keyser said Ford lies. Period. All women to be believed, right? Isn‚Äôt that the point? "
So this is why Kavanaugh has many female law clerks ... 
So you're telling me an innocent child separated from his parents can be held indefinitely in a detention center but we can't hold off on a hearing that confirms a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court?
"So, guess who snuck onto the conference call for organizing against Kavanaugh on Monday and got their entire protest plans"
"So, it will be poetic justice if Brett Kavanaugh becomes the first #SCOTUS Justice to be convicted of attempted rape and thus impeached from the bench. Maryland police chief is prepared to investigate the crime if Professor Blasey Ford simply reports it. "
"So, why is it, that #Beto burglary arrest in 1995, and His DWI arrest in 1998, are ancient history to today's #Democrat party, but #Kavanaugh alleged drunken attack as a teenager in 1980 Needs a thorough investigation‚ùì #Hypocrisy at it's finest "
"Some of the loudest voices dismissing credible sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are opposed to giving a second chance to young, nonviolent drug offenders who have rehabilitated themselves and taken responsibility for their actions. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. "
"Some on the left want to punish Brett Kavanaugh, not as an individual, but as a symbol of collective white male privilege. "
"Soooo...Republicans? Your great idea, during the Year of Women, with #MeToo and #timesup, with DOZENS of DEM women candidates, is to attack a highly respected, credible woman who's accused Kavanaugh of assault? THISCLOSE to Midterms? Good luck with that. "

The GOP isn't simply defending Kavanaugh‚Äîthey have 24 other candidates on deck. They're fighting against the dismantling of the underlying norms and institutions that reinforce patriarchy.

The Republican party has now backed and supported an accused sexual predator for: ‚Äî The White House ‚Äî The Supreme Court ‚Äî The Senate And sadly they aren‚Äôt going to stop unless there are consequences for their behavior. November 6th is their consequence. #VoteThemOut üó≥
The Republicans can certainly kiss the midterms goodbye if they blow this Kavanaugh confirmation.
"The Republicans hope to create a faux-judicial arena around Dr. Ford's trauma. They'll use the same asked for it and how bad could it have been tactics that law enforcement has used, and then declare Kavanaugh innocent. She's wise to proceed cautiously."
The Republicans' attack campaign on sexual assault victim Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was advanced by a man who was fired for sexual harassment. 
"The Senate GOP has offered NO EXPLANATION of why the FBI has not reopened its background investigation on Kavanaugh. The just refuse to do it. Yale law faculty from the Judge‚Äôs law school explain why FBI should investigate. Do it honestly and fairly, or you hurt everyone! "
The Senate should NOT proceed to vote on Kavanaugh until Dr. Ford has had a full investigation like she has rightfully asked for - not a kangaroo court hearing designed to obscure the facts.
"The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President. I hope Republican Voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook."
The campaign against Dr. Ford is being organized from the White House with the explicit approval of Judge Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh is attempting to stay above the fray by not directly questioning Ford's character while approving that less-savory allies do that for him.
"The crazy allegation against Kavanaugh is not just about stopping his confirmation. It‚Äôs also about delegitimizing his future Supreme Court decisions, especially those dealing with abortion and women‚Äôs rights."
The deadly jackals of the American left. Exclusive: Larry Klayman says Kavanaugh is just latest prey of 4-headed monster

"The following; &amp; #Kavanaugh need to be investigated in Jan., 2019. This rat nominated by a treasonous criminal &amp; Putin soldier, must be investigated. He's really dirty &amp; it's all coming out"
The fourth person Christine claimed was at the party says she has no idea what Christine is talking about. What party? And she doesn‚Äôt know Kavanaugh. Let me be the first to say it. Mental case.
"The greatest irony would be for Grassley to push Kavanaugh onto SCOTUS only to have him investigated and convicted of sexual assault in Maryland, leading him to lose not only his SCOTUS seat, but his DC Judge seat as well. Oh, and he'd be a felon. Greed is a horrible drug."
"The guy defending Kavanaugh against claims of attempted rape, quit after being found to also be a sexual predator. GOP: still battling 1000. "
"The lack of transparency in Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation hearings is a disservice to the American people! When Justice Kagan was nominated by President Obama, 99% of her records were released &amp; put into a online database. Let‚Äôs hold #Kavanaugh to that same standard. if you agree!"
"The lawyers also said Judge Kavanaugh would need to testify first, before Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh would be forced yo answer about a Washington Post article detailing allegations, not the words of his accuser. An obvious nonstarter."
"The leaks and the bullying are coming from Ford and her crew against Kavanaugh. I'd say that calling someone a molester in public, is much worse than saying that it isn't true. The mass media would have you believe that it is the Reps and Kavanaugh who are the bully."
"The left will do anything to stop Kavanaugh. America cannot allow them to win. You have the power but do you have the cougar? If you don't, you will be out of office soon. Confirm Kavanaugh NOW!!! No more delay. Confirm Kavanaugh!"
"The long harassment of the Clintons over crazy stuff -- failed land deals, Vince Foster etc -- arguably put George W Bush in the White House; it certainly made Kavanaugh's career 2/"
"The longer they wait for Ford, the more demanded from what was to be hearing. Now they‚Äôre asking for the equivalent of a trial. Yet no rules of the court are to be in play. It‚Äôs becoming more polarized. As a woman I sympathize but still don‚Äôt believe her. "
The man accused of sexual harassment is Garrett Ventry () who has associations with the public relations group that helped to craft and disseminate the Kavanaugh look alike story to discredit Dr. Ford. 
"The man‚Äôs name was Garrett Ventry. It turns out that Ventry also happens to have worked for the very firm, CRC Public Relations, just 3 months ago, who helped Ed Whelen make this incredibly defamatory tweet against Mr. Chris Garret. See here: (3)"
The media calls the accuser Dr. Ford but does not call the accused Dr. Kavanaugh. Why not? They both hold doctoral level degrees.
The media think that the Kavanaugh accuser is going to drive women away from voting Republican in the midterms. I struggle to believe this. What do my female followers think about this claim?
"The more I hear, the more convinced no matter what Dr. Ford says they are going to vote Kavanaugh in. They are only having her testify so they can say they did it, not because they want to get to the truth. So she will be heard but they will not care what she says."
"The next Supreme Court justice could preside over cases involving women's right to choose or women's health care access. We owe it, not only to Dr. Blasey Ford but to every woman in America, that the person we put in that chair is not an abuser of women. #StopKavanaugh"
"The only possible reason for Dr. Ford to demand a Thursday hearing (as opposed to Wednesday/Tuesday or the scheduled Monday) is to prevent the Senate from voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh before month's end, leaving him off the bench when the Supreme Court's next session starts."
"The only reason that I can think of for why the GOP is in such a rush to confirm Kavanaugh, is that they know there is much worse in his past that they don't want the public to find out about. #KavaNo "
The only thing Kavanaugh is a casualty of is his own sordid misogynistic unremorseful past ... pathetic!!!!!
The prep school club is the weakest club supporting Kavanaugh. There's also Yale Law and Kozinski's Clerk Club 
The same goes for Judge Kavanaugh whose family and children experience the same death threats. The country could have avoided this entire sham had you been honest.
"The sick, perverted Mitch McConnell: You‚Äôve watched the fight . But here‚Äôs what I want to tell you: In the very near future, Kavanaugh will be on the Supreme Court. Don‚Äôt get rattled by all of this. We‚Äôre gonna plow right thru it &amp; do our job DON'T GET RATTLED, IT'S JUST RAPE"
The sudden firing of Alex Azar and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh in the troubled Alex Kozinski chambers now needs to be plumbed for any light it sheds on whether Kavanaugh looked the other way as Kozinski sexually harassed his female clerks üëÅ‚¨áÔ∏è 
The suspicion is the political timing of her memory. Any honest and fair person would acknowledge this fact. Especially in view of the fact she has been a never Trumper. Too convenient and timed to prevent Justice Kavanaugh from taking his rightful seat.
The true victims are Kavanaughs daughters &amp; wife. Feinstein is guilty of child abuse. She could have handled this in properly &amp; saved his daughters. Exposed &amp; removed after violent rhetoric started their torture. Ask them in 36 years. #ConfirmKavanaugh 
"The two men and one woman Dr. Ford placed at the party denied anything ever happened. The woman, a lifelong friend of hers not only says it never happened but she has never even met Kavanaugh."
The view inside WH is that Senate Rs have been rather accommodating to Ford already. A senior aide says: At a certain point you have to ask the question: when is this process going to be fair to Brett Kavanaugh?‚Äù
"The vileness of it is compounded by the master class level hypocrisy of those who defend Kavanaugh and Trump as champions of values, by the Franklin Grahams, and Lindsey Grahams and all those other moralistic but two-faced Graham crackers who provide the smokescreen for the AC."
"The witness won‚Äôt testify, he says it didn‚Äôt happen but won‚Äôt swear to it. He wrote a book @ the drunken party high school days where him &amp; his friends believed ‚Äúno means yes &amp; yes means anal‚Äù. Kavanaugh has been working every day to come up with a defense, why if he is innocent."
"The woman who suddenly remembered that 34 years ago when she was 15, a 17 year old touched her boobie and now she's traumatized because he's nominated for the supreme court. Ridiculous."
The women for Kavanaugh are mostly men. 
"The words #MeToo connected us through our pain. But they also connected us to our power. Today, once again, we must connect to that power. We are all Anita Hill. We are all Christine Blasey Ford. We have the power to stop Kavanaugh. Let‚Äôs get to work. (202) 224-3121"
"The written testimony of that named witness reads: Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford. This, if false, is punishable under 18 U.S.C ¬ß 1001."
"Then as now, ‚Äúrapey‚Äù men like #Kavanaugh &amp; #DJT assumed that if they got a woman pregnant from their sick conquests there was safe and legal abortion possible. $$ in an envelope delivered them from all responsibility. Now they attack ROE? Their bald faced hypocrisy is offensive."
"Then stop playing delay game &amp; get on with it. Kavanaugh has been in the public for years &amp; this woman just now comes forward? She's not a victim of Kavanaugh, she's a victim of DC Swamp &amp; MSM This is a circus: You are being played as Fools by Clowns! "
Then tell them the hearing date &amp; time. If she doesn't appear; it's a default &amp; move to vote on Kavanaugh
There are a whole lot of Republicans destroying their reputations this week over Kavanaugh.
"There are lots of crazy out there. That being said, I still think Kavanaugh's accuser's security threats are just hoax..."
There are too many unanswered question like why didn‚Äôt Feinstein bring this up during her questioning Kavanaugh why did she bring it out right before they were going to vote it‚Äôs really fishy if the allegation is really true and important why not bring it up earlier?
There could be any number of legit ways to come into some money. The fact that Kavanaugh hasn‚Äôt offered up any explanation is disturbing 
"There have only been 5 Supreme Court nominees rejected since 1900. None have been rejected for sexual assualy allegations. Also, NONE have been accepted in SPITE OF sexual allegations! #FiletheComplaintwiththeMarylandPolice"
There is NO WORLD where a woman asking for an FBI Investigation into a controversial allegation could be lying. There is EVERY reason to believe that is railroading a process to make a liar into a Supreme Court Justice.
"There is a disdain for women that is emanating from the U.S. Senate that has a pungent, rotten odor. "
"There is a lot of that flying around Twitter right now, yep. I guess I'll join. A man once grabbed me in the danger zone at a nightclub in Hollywood. I punched him in the face. His glasses fell off. I don't blame Judge Kavanaugh. He wasn't even there."
"There is no hurry. There are too many unanswered questions on Kavanaugh‚Äôs integrity. Perjury during these hearings, perjury in his earlier confirmation, shady financial disclosures, and now these allegations."
There is nothing to investigate. The FBI investigates federal crimes. This was not a crime. Did she go and leave the party? Did she make a police report? Did she tell her parents? Did they talk to the Kavanaugh family? If all these answers are no then WHY.
There seem to be many reasons for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. Sex assault. Concealed records. Mysterious payments. And we already know he lies under oath. Why is the GOP trying to ram this clown down our throats? 
"There were many problems with Kavanaugh before the assault allegation. I wish everyone could focus on ALL of it at one time,because the other issues are of equal importance."
"There's a deeply-flawed statistic that weighs down the Kavanaugh debate -- that only 2 to 10 percent of rape claims are false. Thus, the existence of the claim becomes evidence of the claim. But those stats are fundamentally flawed. Here's how: "
There‚Äôs No Reason to Delay the Kavanaugh Vote Any Further 
These are the men who will be judging whether a man credibly accused of attempted rape should get a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land. I think we already know what they think of the accuser. Tell them to #StopKavanaugh here: #MeToo 
These same Republicans refused to hold hearings for 293 days for an open Supreme Court seat under President Obama. Now they‚Äôre denying Dr. Ford a chance to testify because they refuse to wait a few days.
"These vile threats against Judge Kavanaugh‚Äòs family are unacceptable. No one should be threatened, and we cannot accept violent threats as normal parts of our political discourse. This has to stop. "
"They are afraid of losing their grip on the power of the Supreme Court to change our country into the authoritarian theocracy they believe can be the curtain behind which they will build the Randian paradise that will allow them to amass wealth and power, at our expense. "
They are playing games--tell Ford &amp; atty to show up &amp; testify according to Senate rules as laid out or pound sand! Chuck Grassley Gives Kavanaugh‚Äòs Accuser More Time After Missed Deadline #IStandWithBrett #ConfirmJudgeKavanaughNow 
"They are trying to castrate Kavanaugh the way they did Clarence Thomas so that, even if he does get the appointment, he‚Äôll be afraid to take a stand in anything."
They found a record of B Kavanaugh‚Äôs assault on C Ford. 
"They have to treat her the ACCUSER with kiddy GLOVES or the left will say, look how shes being treated... well what about KAVANAUGH??"
"They should also worry that #Kavanaugh could drive suburban women, and others, to the midterms."
They very simply can't. They don't have the votes since the 3 super Rinos are back to maybe. Alternatives are 2 ... ride it out until it/she/they self destruct or pull nomination. We have to do the first or Kavanaugh is destroyed.
This Should End THE CHARADE -- FOURTH Person Christine Ford Named as Being at Party Just Said She Doesn‚Äôt Even Know Kavanaugh; ‚ÄòThere Was Never Any Party‚Äô 
This Washington Post fact-check explains that Brett Kavanaugh has repeatedly misled the Senate under oath. 
This Washington Post lead says Christine Ford was upset when Trump won in ‚Äò16 because Kavanaugh was mentioned as a possible SCOTUS pick. But Kavanaugh wasn‚Äôt added to Trump‚Äôs list of possible justices until November 2017... 
This brave woman came forward &amp; describes a very similar story to Christine Ford w/ a man from Georgetown Prep. Her assaulter signed Kavanaugh's letter of support. Rape culture is more than one person. She is incredibly brave. Please read this thread. 
This charade by Professing Ford &amp; Democrats needs to end as so far there's nothing to support her claim. The more it progresses the more it falls apart &amp; becomes more radical &amp; obstructionist. It's time to end the charade.
This circus regarding the Kavanaugh nomination makes you realize that our own duly elected politicians are morons who couldn't care less about due process. They convict someone w/o facts People who elect these idiots are complicit themselves. Term Limits sound great right now!
This face should be on a #MostWanted poster at the post office. Kavanaugh looks more like a sex offender than a Supreme Court justice IMO. 
This has to be the last delay. Grassley has done more than enough accommodating. Kavanaugh hasn't been demanding after all he's been through.
This has turned into a #Demonrat Kabuki dance to stall a confirmation vote. Why continue the charade? They've already vowed to vote NO on Kavanaugh. There is absolutely NO evidence at all of any wrongdoing. 
"This is a damned kangaroo court there are no facts, there is no evidence, if she hadn‚Äôt waited 36 freaking years, she may have sounded a bit credible. And this circus needs to end. This is all to tarnish Kavanaugh‚Äòs name. #ConfirmJudgeKavanaughNOW"
"This is a great story! I really enjoyed that read Jellenne. People are woke, #Kavanaugh is a warrior, and the DEMs are toast. #WalkAway "
This is a mistake. You said Friday. She played games. Vote Monday. 
"This is a no win situation for the GOP. Nothing is provable-either way-which hurts Kavanaugh. Senators dare not really challenge the claim, but they will challenge him. Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, the issue will be used for the mid terms. Just like Schumer wants. "
This is all absurd. Brett Kavanaugh should just withdraw already.
This is an awesome thread. destroys the Op Kavanaugh disinformation fleet of conformation at all costs. Amazing job. 
This is an excellent op ed by Daniel Henninger and so true. The Democrats have gone to a new low with the attacks on Kavanaugh. The Republicans should use the same tactics for any future supreme court candidates from a democratic president. 
This is an extraordinary moment: Yale Law faculty call on Senate committee to treat allegations seriously in Kavanaugh nomination 
This is breathtakingly dishonest. Kavanaugh has had one response: he didn‚Äôt do it. He said none of the rest of it. 
This is clearly a charade. Ford‚Äôs own ‚Äòwitnesses‚Äô have denied to Senate committee being at the party where she alleges the attack occurred. One identifies as a ‚Äúlifelong friend‚Äù &amp; insists she was never at *any party* ever w the two of them ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
This is embarrassing. These people are trying to deny the next Supreme Court Judge of his constitutional rights.. WTF is going on?? Why are you all allowing this?? Expose them and move on.
"This is how confused America is: someone just asked me: ‚Äúwell what age SHOULD people be held accountable for sexual assault, then?‚Äù ALL THE AGES. FOR EFFS SAKE. RAPE, ATTEMPTED RAPE, ASSAULT ARE ILLEGAL AT ALL AGES. Just cover your bases and tell your boys: NEVER RAPE. #Kavanaugh"
"This is hugging worst offender of #MeToo movement, serial rapist Harvey Weinstein. Yet...she's voting against #Kavanaugh? You just couldn't make this stuff up if you tried! The presumption of guilt? #SaturdayMorning #MAGA #tcot #SaturdayMotivation #FirstDayofFall "
This is intentional. Ford holds enormous power &amp; Grassley can't stand it. This tweet and McConnell today saying they'll plow right through are meant to make her feel powerless. They know Kavanaugh's nomination won't survive her testimony and they're trying to intimidate her. 
This is no conspiracy he's absolutely right everyone should read this Ben Carson gets it always has.
"This is really, really, really true. Future historians (if we survive) will look at video clips and wonder how anyone could possibly have missed the flaming tells of guilt from Trump, Kavanaugh, and co. It will be like watching people host a make-believe tea party in a fire. "
This is ridiculous! 
This is simply insane. It amounts to the claim that Kavanaugh cannot defend himself from this accusation without transgressing against The Moment and must tacitly accept guilt by withdrawing. 
"This is so much bigger than Kavanaugh This is the most visible &amp; consequential test of how the sinister left will do absolutely anything to maintain power and attack conservatives Lie, cheat, delay. Whatever it takes. We absolutely cannot allow them to win. Confirm Kavanaugh"
"This is the last thing we've heard from Sasse on the fiasco. He always finds a mic when it's time to bash Trump, but is silent in the face of this assault on Kavanaugh (much like his silence on DOJ/FBI corruption.) "
"This is the text of Keyser's letter. Note that she doesn't tell Judiciary Committee that she believes the allegation, despite disclaiming any memory of attending such a party *or any other party* where Kavanaugh was present. "
"This is why they're being so overt. They *want* Ford to think the process is rigged, that there's no point in her testifying and that Kavanaugh will be confirmed regardless. But that's not true. They know Kavanaugh's nomination cannot survive her testimony. This is their tell."
This is why we should not be surprised if he drops out if Dr. Ford chooses to come testify. Kavanaugh does not want this hearing any more than Senate Republicans do. 
"This is your Democrat party on steroids. The party of hate and obstruction. They hate America, they hate you and me. It‚Äôs time to #WalkAway Democrats float more Kavanaugh investigations, impeachment even if he is confirmed "
"This isn't a setback, it's a null. Why would she remember Kavanaugh at a party 36 years ago unless something memorable, literally, happened? Ford remembers, she says, because she was almost raped. "
This pathetic president is now attacking Dr. Ford personally. And McConnell said Kavanaugh will get confirmed no matter what. The only language these toads understand is power. So let‚Äôs use the power of our votes to strip them of their power in November. It is the only way.
This story should be titled: Why the GOP Won't Let Mark Judge Testify 
"This woman is so hateful, hateful, hateful! "
"This: ‚ÄúI said that Mommy had a story about a Supreme Court nominee, and now it‚Äôs broken into the news, and we can‚Äôt stay in the house anymore. is shattering. The very least we can do is call our senators and show we support her and her family."
"Those who whine about the need to presume innocence of the accused can take that only so far with Kavanaugh, because GOP is going to plow through and confirm him regardless of evidence-that seems to be a bigger problem than innocent until proven guilty-this is innocent regardless"
Thread on the average voters defending Kavanaugh on CNN who are actually Republican operatives 
"Thread they are all GOP plants! I'm generally a fan of and , but this is journalistic malpractice. Why is CNN painting these women as average Republican voters? ‚Ä¶"
"Throughout my life, I have felt so attuned to men‚Äôs feelings that sometimes I prioritized them over my own (all the sex I didn‚Äôt want but had anyway) ‚Äî either to make those men feel better or to protect myself from their wrath; sometimes both. "
Tick tock. 
"Time for you Marxist Dems to heel. We won, you lost. We get to choose the court. You do not. Better load up on Xanax because After we swear in Justice Kavanaugh, We have Amy Coney Barrett waiting to replace Sleeping Beauty. #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 "
"Time to atone. Men who went to prep school w/ Kavanaugh or were with him in crude &amp; rude fraternity &amp; secret group that degraded women, please show a little courage. Speak up."
"Time to denounce this political party as a American terrorist organization. Everything they do is set to destroy the America we all love. Democrats float more Kavanaugh investigations, impeachment even if he is confirmed "
Time to investigate Orrin Hatch's office 
"Timing: if my abuser was up for the Supreme Court and was going to make legislation on my body, a body he‚Äôs already violated, that would be when I‚Äôd come out too. Witnesses: K‚Äôs story has changed 4x. Judge won‚Äôt implicate himself. Others @ party said they believe her."
"To Republican leaders, this anti-women agenda is a feature, not a bug. It is part of their larger strategy to expand its war on women in the Trump era. Will &amp; save us? Brilliant op-ed by : "
"To do list: confirm Kavanaugh, fire Rosenstein, release FISA Documents, end Mueller witch hunt, what‚Äôd I leave out?"
To me the image of Kavanaugh pressing his hand on her mouth to stop her from screaming could stand for the GOP treatment of Ford all week.
To those who say the Kavanaugh alleged attempted rape was 30+ yrs ago... High School isn't an excuse for criminal behavior And we see what the GOP are doing they appear to be trying to cover up a crime to get a Judge on the Supreme Court so that he can help Trump cover up crimes
"Tonight appears in Iowa with Ed Whelan, who fabricated the story about a lookalike who was really responsible for Kavanaugh's attack on Dr. Ford. Jim Jordan never misses an opportunity to embrace a bully and shame a victim. Women can change this in November. "
"Too late. Plus how did you know to pick this guy? Did kavanaugh tell you too? Well then, he knows it‚Äôs true ... and how does he know it‚Äôs true? Cause he was most likely in that room!! I hope you - and your organization - are sued to high heaven."
"Too many men are full of empathy ‚Äì for perpetrators, not victims ‚Äì when stories such as Kavanaugh‚Äôs emerge, and that apparently they cannot imagine what it is like to be a woman who has been assaulted. "
Top Aide Leading GOP Response to Kavanaugh Allegations Resigns Amid Prior Sexual Harassment Claims 
Totally disingenuous. Keyser flatly denies even knowing Kavanaugh &amp; or participating in ‚Äòany‚Äô party with him. Keyser is faulting Ford‚Äôs memory. 
Trump Asks Why Kavanaugh Accuser Didn‚Äôt Just Immediately Request Hush Money 
Trump aide called GOP operatives to spread Kavanaugh accuser's name before her story was published 
"Trump, Mitch McConnell and GOP Senators are screaming that Brett Kavanaugh needs to be confirmed immediately. Why? McConnell and the GOP Senate left Justice Scalia's seat open for 422 days - Yep Well over a year. But now all of sudden it's an emergency! #BS"
"Trump/surrogates have been sitting on the Rosenstein (non)story, waiting to use it for a time like now, when they're FRANTIC about Kavanaugh &amp; the midterms. The real question in my mind though, is why is the NYT doing Trumps bidding?"
"Trump‚Äôs HUD Secretary Ben Carson links the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh to a socialist plot begun by the 19th Century Fabian Society. ‚ÄúAnd the further they get away from being able to control the courts, the more desperate they become.‚Äù "

"Uh, Kavanaugh hires clerks that look like models? His mentor is a judge who kept pornography on his work computer? And we should all assume he‚Äôs above reproach because he coaches little girls soccer teams? Nuh uh. That‚Äôs not where this survivor‚Äôs mind goes."
"Ultimately, the Republicans, Trump and Russia want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court for two reasons. 1. To have the votes to put a stop to the Mueller investigation when the issue goes to the courts, which it will 2. To have a court that will allow Trump to pardon himself"
"Um, why are all of these arguments about whether Brett Kavanaugh is fit for the Supreme Court coming out during his confirmation hearing??? "
"Umm, you might want to do some research. He testified first and last. Would Kavanaugh be given the same treatment?"
Ummm Kavanaugh has already went through numerous background investigations. Kavanaugh has agreed to testify under oath at risk of perjury. Kavanaugh wants to clear his name. Why won‚Äôt Ford?

"Wanting to leave the country over a 36 year old allegation after KAVANAUGH had been a Judge on the 2nd most important Circuit Court already and she'd said nothing? Travelled 3,000 miles and went to Hawaii but hates planes? Sounds totally stable üíØ "

We are at a horrifying juncture. Kavanaugh will likely be confirmed. Leaving us with an imbalanced Supreme Court that will not represent the majority. The Kochs and Mercers will move swiftly to take control of women‚Äôs bodies and strip away individual rights via the courts.

Weekly Update: Americans should brook no further delay of a full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation to SCOTUS. Their new gambit is delaying the nomination past the elections. The Senate should shut this circus down &amp; move the confirmation along. 
Well Ms. Keyset says she was never at a party with Ford and Kavanaugh so the point is moot!

"Well since tripe Ford allegation is of attempted rape at a drunken party, #Kavanaugh is SOL "
Well that is rich from Feinstein. Lest we forget Ford went to the media herself under her own volition with the intent to leak the story in order to derail Kavanaugh. What they didn't count on was that the FBI would not step in and frame K with false evidence.
"Well, along with and her appalled state, I'd say this brings us to two GOP senators with the spine not to confirm they'll tie the line and vote yes on Kavanaugh no matter what. üôÑ "

We‚Äôre maybe a week away from learning that the GOP knew about Kavanaugh‚Äôs past all along and engineered a cover-up long before he first accepted the nomination.
"We‚Äôre starting to learn a lot about Kavanaugh‚Äôs accuser. Christine Blasey Ford: ‚Äîcan‚Äôt recall details of alleged incident ‚Äîhas family negatively affected by Kavanaugh‚Äôs mom ‚Äîdonates to the DNC, Democrat politicians and causes ‚Äîis an anti-Trump activist ‚Äîscrubbed online presence"
"What Dr. Ford should say: Grassley, you old white southerner, you have backed me into a corner just like kavanaugh did. You should be removed from office and slink off in shame. NO woman should vote Republican again."

What did Chuck Grassley know and when did he know it?! Grassley hired Garrett Ventry who resigned today bc his history of sexual harassment was revealed to the public. Did Grassley know when hired him? What about Ventry's ties to smearing Dr Ford? 
What have the accusations created for Judge Kavanaugh? Has anyone asked him if accusations of attempted rape have caused ‚Äútremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress‚Äù? Or does he not matter in this equation anymore? 
What if Ford is in such a liberal campus bubble that she thought she could just accuse Kavanaugh and watch him be destroyed by the claim as often happens on college campuses under Title IX.
"What is extremely disturbing is that a GoFundMe account was set up for Christine Blasey Ford, not by her, but someone else, for security. Also disturbing is that had Ford's letter since July and the has had it and previously cleared Judge Kavanaugh."
"What is happening to Brett Kavanaugh should frighten every man. At any moment, a Feminazi can ruin ur life with uncorroborated claims of sexual assault. No proof whatsoever--if she says it happened, you stand to lose everything you have worked for. We are in dangerous times."
What is it we resist? We resist a rapist wannabe sitting on the high court. We resist a perjurer being confirmed. We resist a man who has a gambling and drinking problem. We resist a judge who would not prosecute a president. 
What is on the Supreme Court docket in October that Democrats are working so hard to keep Kavanaugh from being seated Oct 1st?
What is the evidence? None whatsoever. Democrats are absolutely desperate for Kavanaugh not to be confirmed they will try and say anything. Pathetic &amp; an embarrassment to America.
"What is wrong with Senate Rep leadership? Can't they do their job or do they like being played by Democrats? If Chuck Grassley can't fo his job let someone else do it. If Reps can't confirm Kavanaugh because of this false allegation, the midterm is going to look bad for them."
What kind of political party would allow a lying liberal activist to interupt the vote of a Supreme Court Justice? Is ANYONE in the Republican Senate leadership smart enough to realize that this woman is only trying to stall the vote? I am embarrassed to witness this stupidity.
What makes this story more significant is someone seems to be lying/covering this up. How could Whelan have gotten Ford‚Äôs name yet: ‚ÄúA WH spokesman said.neither Kavanaugh nor anyone in the WH gave Ford‚Äôs name to Whelan before it was disclosed by The Post?

What we're seeing with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford is what black women have long endured. Black women say they were sexually assaulted and black men not believing them and accusing them of being sluts. Black men and white men share a camaraderie in sexually abusing women.
"What would Senator Grassley, Senator McConnell, and the Senate Republicans do if before the Full Senate Vote, she and the local officials file charges against Kavanaugh?"
"What would happen if a Kavanaugh arrest warrant was served at the Senate Hearing...?? ‚ÄúWe are prepared to investigate if the victim wants to report to us, &amp; we can determine it occurred in the County,‚Äù Montogomery City Police Chief Tom Manger said... "
"Whatever Dr. Blasey Ford decides about testifying despite the rigged process, and whatever the Senate does, what happened in MD isn‚Äôt going to stay in MD. Nor will Kavanaugh‚Äôs denial remain in the WH &amp; the Senate. It will reverberate ‚Äúuntil the last syllable of recorded time.‚Äù "

What‚Äôs the rush? The average days to vote on SCOTUS has been 25 days with a max of 125 days. Obama‚Äôs two averaged 76.5 days. GWB‚Äôs 41 days. Clinton 61 days. GHWB 84. Reagan 70. Kavanaugh hearings started 9/4 - 18 days ago. 
"Whelan and Kavanaugh should pay for a new house for the teacher to pay for the damage they have done to his reputation. They are cold and if you are not guilty, why would you try to pin it on someone else? "

"When Clarence Thomas &amp; Brett Kavanaugh shake hands in about 10 days, they will have a knowing bond that few men on this earth will ever, ever understand. It will be historic and powerful. A triumph of truth over deceit. A solemn unspoken vow to uphold justice over partisan hate. "
When Kavanaugh fails Trump is going to be a whiny little bitch and blame it all on dems; hopefully dem women. Then he will rush another nominee into the slot. This nominee is likely to be as squeaky clean as the rest of the swamp 45 reveres. So much winning. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
When nothing is proved by this Ford nut case Judge Kavanaugh needs to file a law suit for defamation of character. For the lies and pain caused to him and his family. These bottom feeders ( Democrats.) need to be taught a lesson and Feinstein should be removed from her seat!!!
"While (Ventry) strongly denies allegations of wrongdoing, he decided to resign to avoid causing any distraction from the work of the committee. ... Wouldn't just make sense for Kavanaugh to do the same?? Withdraw his nomination. "

Who‚Äôs Bullying! Anyone who casts Guilt or Innocence on Ford or Kavanaugh until she shows up and testifies carries Absolutely No CLOUT! No show Then VOTE! üá∫üá∏
"Why all 51 of GOP senators likely vote to confirm Kavanaugh? If they vote no, they will be vilified &amp; treated by the base as Dr. Ford has been treated- abused on social media, receive death threats, etc especially those retiring &amp; no longer in power. They are afraid"
Why are Democrats not using the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's records have not been released yet amongst accusations of sexual assault against him? If they can't ask the FBI to investigate shouldn't they release this guy's records? I thought he was just slimy. #WhatAreTheyHiding 
Why does Christine Ford‚Äôs story not add up? 1. She admitted they did not run in same circles back then. 2. She is the ONLY female at this supposed party at some house she does not know. 3. All 3 people she named have denied it happened. 4. Nothing in Kavanaugh‚Äôs history similar.
Why don't you dumb bells at CNN loop those 'random' female republican operatives talking about Kavanaugh some more. That was some real lousy journalism y'all are running there. Shame on you. For those unaware see thread on who those women are.
"Why even hold a vote? Why not just say publicly state that no matter how the vote goes, or what evidence the wrongdoing is produced, you're going to put Brett Kavanaugh's in the Supreme Court seat? Why even act like you follow rules at all anymore?"
Why in the hell are we negotiating with Christine Ford? This is her allegation Screw her ‚Äònegotiations‚Äô Who tf does she think she is Walk away Confirm Kavanaugh This is the one of the weakest and most ridiculous things I have ever witnessed.
Why is Chuck Grassley setting such arbitrary deadlines? Why is he rushing when he‚Äôs kept SCOTUS seats open much longer than this? What doesn‚Äôt he want the American people to find out? 
"Why is Ford‚Äôs credibility assumed to be unassailable, despite all the huge red flags about her motivations and story- And on the other side, it‚Äôs just fine for Senators, press etc to believe Kavanaugh is a liar and an attempted rapist with ZERO evidence? This is total Bullsh**"
Why isn't Kavanaugh asking for an FBI investigation if he's innocent? Maybe for the same reason I don't ask for a cavity search prior to leaving a store...I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG! #Kavanaugh #LiberalLogic
"Why should #Kavanaugh be a judge , who is unwilling to be judged?"
Why was Ed Whelan researching Professor Ford before her name was made public? Was he charged with concocting a story by Kavanaugh or his handlers? 
With all due respect Senator Grassley but your committee has given Dr. Ford plenty of time to testify and tell her side of this alleged accusation and now you need to take action and vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"With all due respect to your personal situation, the Kavanaugh situation has more to do with the Dems trying to permanently derail the confirmation process with delays. "
"With no statute of limitations for sexual assault in Maryland, Montgomery City Police Chief Tom Manger confirms that he is prepared to investigate the alleged sexual assault of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford by Brett Kavanaugh if a complaint is filed #maddow"
"Withdraw Kavanaugh, you are just dragging yourselves, this country and thru the mud. We see thru all your bullying. We will impeach Kavanaugh if we have to, we will vote you out of office, we will bring down the trump admin."
Withhold 90% of relevant documents. No FBI inquiry of sexual assault allegation. An unnecessarily rushed vote. The legitimacy of the Supreme Court is being/will be put into question. This is pernicious and way more important than a political ‚Äúvictory‚Äù.
"Within 90 minutes of the White House learning of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford but hours before the news broke, Dr. Blasey Ford discovered Ed Whelan viewing her LinkedIn profile: "
"Without ever meeting her, no evidence, lack of basic details NOBODY would EVER forget, denials by EVERYONE named, no charges, and literally unprovable. High-Ranking Democrats Say They Believe Kavanaugh‚Äôs Accuser [VIDEO] via "

Worth noting that Orrin Hatch is exactly where he was in October 1991. Relentlessly impugning the integrity of a woman in order to jam through a nominee to the Supreme Court. 27 years ago. 
"Wow Grassley gives Ford another extension and tweets his decision? Come on peeps, no one finds that strange? Are we being distracted? #LJMAGA üßêüßê"
Wow I truly hope that does not come to pass. Kavanaugh should NEVER make SCOTUS!
Wow just wow Aide for GOP involved in Kavanaugh nomination resigns after past sexual harassment allegation surfaces 
"Wow! What high school boy hasn't pushed a girl into a bedroom, locked the door, turned up the music and put his hand over the girl's mouth and then tried to undress that girl? Seriously? And it's odd that so many who defend Kavanaugh assume that he did what he is denying. "
"Wow. And CNN reporting that the fourth person, Leland Keyser, is denying memory of knowing kavanaugh or of this event, even though Keyser is a lifelong friend of Ford's. Wow, again."
Y'all that Ed Whelan thread that was a complete train wreck? A PR firm helped craft it. No joke: 
"YES these Guys were friends.1 Had alcoholic Blackouts &amp; BK drank 2Passing out,no respect 4 Girls,&amp;Chosen by Pres.Who Assaulted/Humiliated women 4 Decades &amp; Paid hundreds of Thousandsüí∞2 hide It.BRETTS MOTTO‚ÄùWHAT HAPPENS IN GEORGETOWN PREP STAYS IN GT PREP‚Äù "

Yale Law School Dean now speaks out after it was uncovered that professor Amy Chua said it is not an accident that Brett Kavanaugh's female law clerks all looked like models - she was grooming them. Why do female Republican Senator like find this acceptable? 
Yawn. Kavanaugh gets confirmed. Elections matter.
Yawn. Yet another pump fake to try to get to the midterms without a vote on Kavanaugh. #MeTooHucksters 
Yeah they only care about confirming their little c*** cock boy to the Supreme Court so that way you can overturn a women's rights and tell them to go suffer and die I'd like to see the day when his two grown girls get pregnant by some rapist or whatever and then he has to deal
"Yeah, bully the victim. Great plan. First, no investigation; now this. Makes me sick. "
"Yeah, let's talk about political calculations. Let's start with Dianne Feinstein getting a letter from someone accusing the Supreme Court nominee of a crime 35 years ago that she sat on through the entire confirmation hearings, including when she met with him privately."
Yep. Kavanaugh allies were telling reporters yesterday to keep an eye on Whelan‚Äôs Twitter feed 
Yes it's time to move on and stop giving into this woman and I am using the term loosely in this case. You can't believe her if she won't testify and Kavanaugh should not go 1st. He needs to be able to defend himself. What a crock??????
"Yes, let's see put her vote where her mouth insists she is. Does she really want this Kavanaugh debacle to be for what she wants to be remembered?"
"Yes, that‚Äôs right: Senate Judiciary Republicans‚Äô spokesperson on the Kavanaugh matter was relieved, with immediate effect, because ‚Ä¶ of credible allegations of harassment against him. "
Yet another Brett Kavanaugh mystery. 
"You are another poster child for term limits and mandatory retirement age. The fact that you have to give Kavanaugh an explanation is very telling. The fix is in, you all don't care what he did. You just want to stack the court. #MERRICKGARLAND. He deserved a hearing."
You can't compare the two. Garland never went through the confirmation process so there was no reason to find him a bad person or unqualified or otherwise find him wrong for the job. Kavanaugh is actually going through the process.
You have already decided to doubt the woman and believe the man. You have already decided do not believe Ford because you want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court bench at all costs. You have already decided to create a she-said-he-said kangaroo court instead of following precedent.
You just completely skipped the past where she said she doesn't know Kavanaugh.
"You know you have a problem on your hands when the guy who is your spokesman, Garrett Ventry, to defend Republicans' handling of the Kavanaugh nomination is forced to resign because he had been fired from a previous job for sexual harassment allegations. "
You need to accept the fact that we will NEVER allow YOU of all people to appoint a Supreme Court Judge. You can't even tie your shoes without inhaling a Big Mac. You can't even keep your own country safe during hurricanes.
"You owe it to YOUR constituents to consider the testimonies of the 65+ women who advocated for Judge Kavanaugh, and the 2 gentlemen who testified under oath, vs one person who can't remember vital details of her accusation"
"You seem slow, I'll try to use small words. FBI already looked into Kavanaugh, as part of the process to vet him for the court. New information has arisen, which they could look into as part of the standard background check for Kavanaugh if so requested."
You seem to think that being found guilty in a court of law and losing freedom by going to prison are the same things as being found guilty in the court of public opinion and losing the ability to sit on the Supreme Court. I'm sure Franklin knew the difference.
"You were wrong Kavanaugh is NOT going to plow right through. And shortly, you will be the minority leader! "
"Your ‚Äújob‚Äù is to carry out the will of your constituents, not your major campaign donors. It seems a large majority of voters don‚Äôt want Kavanaugh on the bench. Why do you persist? #WhatAreYouHiding ?"
You‚Äôre trying 2 railroad her. She knows it &amp; we do it. What you‚Äôre doing 2 her is absolutely disgraceful. McConnell stayed it clearly. You‚Äôre going 2 plow Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination thru regardless. This is a farce. GOP DOESN‚ÄôT CARE HOW BAD HE IS AS LONG AS THEIR AGENDA CONTINUES!
"Yup. Barn-burner of a piece, and accurate: Kavanaugh is MORE appealing to Republicans now, not less, because modern right-wing politics is (among other things) a pro-sexual-assault ideology. It WANTS world where (white) men get away with these things again "
a guy not fit to be president nominated a guy thats not fit to be a supreme court justice that needs the approval of a bunch of people not fit to be senators. if this isnt a complete breakdown of all three branches of government i dont know what is.

how do you support a rapist? #Kavanaugh is a rapist.
"if you think that it is absolutely DISGUSTING that these Kavanaugh supporters are legitimizing, normalizing &amp; justifying assualt on women. "
"is in a 'no win' situation which they brought on themselves by bullying Dr. Ford, denying her right to have witnesses &amp; making preemptive stmts about voting him without hearing her testimony. Only way for this to be minimally salvaged is to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination."
"isn‚Äôt MAGA#! Remove her from this train! She‚Äôs #Resist, #Metoo, and against #Kavanaugh! "
"just raised excellent point on CNN. If isn‚Äôt careful, Dr Ford can simply go to Maryland and file charges against Kavanaugh. And then we‚Äôd have a sitting Supreme Court justice under investigation for attempted rape. Right before the midterms."
kavanaugh should ie vigorously fall on his sword here
"let's get this clear, no one is bullying Ford into a corner. She did with accusations! DEMS and MSM are bullying Kavanaugh and his family. She's had 35 years to prepare. Put up or shut up. I'm sick of tactics Democrats push daily. Unamerican #VoteRedToSaveAmerica"
"released. Americans have not gotten a satisfactory answer as to how he accrued the $200k debt &amp; more important, how it was suddenly paid off. Kavanaugh has lied under oath. He is not fit for SCOTUS. Almost 70% of Americans think he is not fit. You aren't listening to us, so &gt;&gt;"
"saw this in an article in the nytimes highlighting top reader comments on kavanaugh/Ford. i‚Äôm sure this is well meant, but it is totally enraging that he took it upon himself to RE-VET her ALREADY PEER-REVIEWED academic work for signs of self-promotion. who asked him? "
"so help me understand this Supreme Court thing: it was OK to keep Scalia's seat open for over 400 days because fuck you, that's why, and right now it's imperative that we rush into a vote on Blackout Brett as soon as possible because fuck you, that's why, do I have that right"

"the Dems are playing you so them to take a hike. You‚Äôre not going to lose the Republican women‚Äôs vote in November or the Independent vote. Dems are dirty &amp; we stand with Kavanaugh. Vote on Monday, he is INNOCENT "
"this is consistent with getting blackout drunk. whatever happened Kavanaugh was not proud of it: Reminders to everyone to be very, very vigilant w/r/t confidentiality on all issues and all fronts, including with spouses."
this is idiotic. it's not a criminal trial. the obligation is on him to convince senators he should get a lifetime appointment. I swear Graham has dropped 50 IQ pts since McCain passed away 
"tick-tock: 9/16 - Whelan starts research after WP names Ford to WH pre-publication 9/17 - Kavanaugh suggests mistaken identity to Hatch, WSJ editorializes 9/18 - Whelan predicts Kavanaugh vindication 9/19 - Hatch flack: ‚Äúkeep eye on Ed‚Äôs tweets‚Äù 9/20 - Whelan names classmate"
