" Although his daughter Marine Le Pen, the current leader of the Front National, is demonstrating a more moderate sound and thus seems to be enjoying success in France, this party is not completely free of past hatred. Together with Le Pen, Wilders aims to form one large opposition party in the European Parliament. In addition to the PVV and the Front National, the alliance should consist of other nationalist parties that also oppose the EU and the euro. At Le Pen's visit yesterday, Wilders spoke of a historic collaboration that he believes must lead to the liberation of the EU elite . Wilders claims that he does not have to fully agree with all the positions of the parties he wants to fight the EU with."
" Hunting for the same voter groups, VVD list leader Van Baalen and PVV front man De Graaff flew at each other. You are lying and deceiving , snapped the liberal De Graaff when he claimed that the VVD would have said that the loans to Greece from the EU should be partly cancelled. The PVV pointed out that Switzerland and Norway can also trade with the whole world without the euro, and do not need to transfer billions to bail out ailing southern European countries. The SP fears that if policies remain unchanged, this will continue for decades."
" Moreover, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa argues that despite the support, the EU-Zimbabwe relationship remains heavily poisoned. The EU does maintain the freeze on Mugabe's assets in Europe and he is not allowed to travel in the EU, nor is his wife Grace. The PVV is highly surprised that the EU wants to transfer tax money from hardworking Dutch people without blinking an eye to a bank account in Harare.."
" According to Bontes, Wilders was already not very steady in his European cooperation. For example, together with Le Pen, he announced his intention to work with the British anti-European party UKIP. In 2010, when I was in the European Parliament for the PVV, UKIP asked us to work together. Geert held that off at the time."
" On May 22, the PVV hopes to capitalize on the anti-European sentiment among many Dutch people, and thus find its way back up the ladder. Wilders is once again attracting attention because the PvdA and GroenLinks are using websites to point out to the voters what they consider to be the wrong friends the PVV is looking for in Brussels. These include the far-right FPÖ in Austria and the French Front National, led by the daughter of the anti-Semitic Jean Marie Le Pen.Of the criticism, Wilders takes no notice."
" PVV leader Wilders finds the outcome overwhelming. On Thursday, the British research bureau Capital Economics presents its report on the economic consequences of the Netherlands' departure from the EU. That research was commissioned by the PVV. A strong and sovereign Netherlands outside the EU is good for the Dutch economy, ensures that we regain control over our borders, our own money, our budget and decide for ourselves who can make use of our benefits and facilities , says the group chairman."
" Depending on the outcome of these negotiations, it will indicate its position for the referendum on French membership of the Union. There is a lot of upheaval in the EU, according to the President of the National Front. Many countries will take advantage of this opportunity to come and get regulations and treaties that are detrimental to their security or economy withdrawn as well."
" Europarliamentarian Wim van de Camp, number 3 on the CDA list, also thinks that the upcoming victory of the populist right will force the European elite to listen better to the voices of society. The positions of parties like the PVV, such as leaving the EU and the euro, are based on what is going on among the citizens. So the CDA, VVD and PvdA should not dismiss those views as stupid, one-sided or populist."
" That is asking for trouble, and that trouble now has a date: May 22, 2014, the day of the European elections. These promise to be a reckoning: it is by no means excluded that in France the Front National and the Parti de Gauche will win the elections, in the United Kingdom UKIP and in the Netherlands the PVV together with the SP. In short, that the anti-More Europe populism of the left and right is going to become a force of significance in the European parliament."
 Withdrawal 'disaster' The SNP's demand for a separate vote on EU membership has now been matched by a similar one from Sinn Féin for Northern Ireland. Martin McGuinness argued that British withdrawal from the EU would be disastrous for Northern Ireland.
" Austria is a victim again. A little more than 15 years ago, the other EU members decided to impose sanctions on Austria because the ÖVP under Schüssel had formed a coalition with the FPÖ under Jörg Haider against serious misgivings in the EU. Great excitement, solidarity reflex in wide circles, partial isolation of Austria."
" Even a euro-critical party like the SP does not want a Nexit and also believes that the British should stay. PVV leader Wilders has announced a referendum on a so-called Nexit in the event of a Brexit. PVV and Bontes/Van Klaveren, with a total of 14 seats, are far from forming a parliamentary majority."
" FULL TEXT: On top of that, Geert Wilders' PVV, the most radical opponent of the European Union and the euro, is projected to suffer a surprising loss when the real results are announced Sunday evening at 11:00. Viewed this way, the proponents of the European Union can be satisfied."
" FULL TEXT: VVD MP Mark Verheijen allowed himself to be lured into saying that the leader of the European liberals Guy Verhofstadt was more dangerous for Europe than anti-Europeans like PVV leader Geert Wilders and the far-right Marine Le Pen, leader of the French Front National. Verheijen had to apologize, VVD-prominent Frits Bolkestein supported him, after which euro commissioner and VVD'er"
" Problem of the ÖVP As much harmony as is shown between the ÖVP and the FPÖ, it ceases to exist when it comes to EU issues, and even more so when it comes to Othmar Karas. FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had already stated that he found it difficult to imagine Karas as an EU Commissioner."
" According to correspondence, Capital Economics, which received a prestigious award last year for research on exiting the euro, will finish the study by the end of this year. Wilders will receive Marine Le Pen in The Hague tomorrow to reinforce his anti-European agenda. The bureau and the PVV would not comment.."
" An alternative dividing line can be found with the Ukraine referendum in April this year. There, two completely different groups faced each other than left and right . The 'no' camp (PVV, SP, VNL, 50Plus) was anti-free trade, anti-EU, pro-Netherlands and against the political elite. The Yes camp (the rest) was broadly pro-EU and pro-free trade, anti-populist and willing to compromise.The outcome is known: the voters voted no."
" Contrary to what his fiercest critics say, Kaczynski is not at all assuming a polexit. He is aware of the benefits that Poland has gained, including under the PiS government, from its presence in the EU. But he will only step back when that Union sword of Damocles is flying at his head."
" Harald Vilimsky F-For the ÖVP's top candidate in the EU elections, the FPÖ's top candidate is quite a stranger. I have never had a coffee with him,"" said Othmar Karas when asked about his relationship with Harald Vilimsky in the EU Parliament."
 Harald Vilimsky The right-wing nationalist to extreme right-wing prominence in the EU spoke out in a joint declaration at the weekend. Right in the middle: the FPÖ. DER STANDARD spoke with their EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky about his foreign policy plans and the current conflicts within the EU.
" Krzysztof Gawkowski (Left) reproached Kaczynski for not coming to the committee that debated the no-confidence vote before noon. He said the PiS president, instead of dealing with the pandemic, from the center of the PiS universe in Nowogrodzka is urging a veto of the EU budget. And that Kaczynski furnished the Poles with a wild west, he gave the order to his Tribunal on tightening abortion."
" Sounds nice and all, but how will you finance that reduction? It's payable. Especially by cutting subsidies, the EU and by cutting development aid. Leftist critics will say: there you have the xenophobic PVV again, who wants to hide the Netherlands behind the dikes. Everyone in Europe is counting our money."
" That the coalition will fail on the Europe issue is not suggested by Strache's first signals. No more talk of possible plebiscites on withdrawal, instead a commitment to a subsidiary EU analogous to Kurz. In the understanding of the FPÖ leader: less, but better. No mean feat, Strache also reacted to the fact that President Alexander Van der Bellen is said to have already expressed reservations about a blue interior and foreign minister."
" The British exit provides a huge boost to these forces. If it works there, why not here? PVV leader Geert Wilders already announced that he would make the demand for a Dutch referendum on EU membership the spearhead of his campaign for the elections next year. In this he will be supported by organizations such as the Forum for Democracy of opinion leader Thierry Baudet, who sympathizes with the ideas of the PVV."
" The Cabinet is in favor of this because it would be good for trade and for the democratization process in Ukraine. The main opposing parties are PVV and SP. They fear that with the treaty Ukraine's accession to the EU comes a step closer. If less than 30 percent of the voters show up, the referendum is invalid and the treaty goes forward."
" The European Union is by no means perfect, and we are one of the most critical parties of the EU, but it's quite clear that it would have a devastating impact on the island, having one part of the island in the EU and one part out, says Daithí McKay, the Sinn Féin MLA for North Antrim. He cites agriculture and tourism, both of which are vital to the economy in his constituency, as sectors that would be badly hit by a Brexit. Some republicans argue that UK withdrawal from the EU would make it easier for Sinn Féin to make the argument for Irish unity. But, according to the political commentator and columnist Alex Kane, the party may well have drawn the opposite conclusion."
" The tragedy is that the middle parties are putting themselves in harm's way with this. In their efforts to avoid coming across as a Europhile - about the worst accusation there apparently is - they remain stuck in half-hearted, defensive judgments about the European Union. In doing so they are merely displaying their own insecurity and discomfort, which only plays into the hands of the PVV. The only effective response to the radical position of the anti-Europeans is a radical pro-European response."
" This is exactly what happened in Britain, where a tactical move by a weak prime minister and a lying campaign in the press and nationalist movements led to the highly risky Brexit referendum. The anti-EU campaign that the Krone and the FPÖ have been running in Austria has very little to do with the real situation. Seen in this light, the 38 per cent figure is not yet alarming."
" A majority in the House of Representatives is not in favor of it either. As long as the Nexit referendum is not forthcoming, the committee says it will use all means to strain the bond between the Netherlands and Brussels. Another initiator, Thierry Baudet of the Forum for Democracy, was more moderate on Wednesday. This cannot be ignored, it is the beginning of a discussion about a different European Union anyway, he said."
" About the words of the Andalusian leader of the party, Teresa Rodriguez, who on Thursday acknowledged his fear that Podemos suffers the same shaking legs that Alexis Tsipras has suffered, Errejón said that these statements were prior to the announcement of the resignation, thus giving the matter settled.European problemErrejón denounced that the situation of the Hellenic country is not a Greek problem, but a European one, and stressed that Tsipras was elected with the mandate to put an end to the failed policy of austerity that so much suffering has caused in Greece. To this end, he said, the Greek Prime Minister initiated tough negotiations with the EU in which a good part of the governments showed servility towards Chancellor Merkel.To combat these problems, Podemos announced that three fundamental reforms must be undertaken in the EU. Firstly, the modification of the ECB to bring it closer to the U.S. Federal Reserve; the implementation of investment policies instead of austerity policies, and finally a debt conference in which it is recognized that countries need to grow in order to face their debts.0"

" According to Eugen Freund, the SPÖ delegation in the European Parliament has no problem with this, but rather a clear position, especially after the recent outbursts by US President Donald Trump: Something must go further in the common foreign policy. Otherwise, we as Europe can pack our bags in the world,"" says the Socialist MEP.FPÖ insists on Viennese veto in EU foreign policy Conflict in the government: Secretary General Vilimsky rejects abolition of the unanimity principle The European Union should retain the principle of unanimity in common foreign policy. It is important that all Member States continue to be involved in the decision-making process and have the possibility to veto decisions in the EU Foreign Affairs Council."
" Although the FPÖ has so far supported the accession of Serbia, it has been hostile to the other countries in the region.A European balancing act for the FPÖ Analysis."
" And Karas was by far the most attractive top candidate according to this poll: five percent ticked the SPÖ because of Eugen Freund, four percent the Greens because of Ulrike Lunacek and still two percent the Neos because of their controversial top candidate Angelika Mlinar. Harald Vilimsky was the least popular: according to the survey, he was not the reason for a single FPÖ voter's decision to vote. Understandably, EU issues played a decisive role - even in the question of who goes to the polls in the first place. 65 per cent of voters, but only 40 per cent of non-voters, believe that EU membership benefits Austria."
" Beata Mazurek, chairwoman of the social policy and family committee, applied to the Foreign Ministry for it under pressure from the opposition. Both Solidarity and Law and Justice have been repeatedly warned that the European Union will not agree to any restrictions on the free trade of online stores.Meanwhile, the Sunday trading ban bill also restricts online trading."
" But Reimon confirms that Vilimsky's plan to unite Europe's Union-sceptical right-wing populists in an even broader alliance that trumps the Social Democrats in terms of mandates could become reality after the election battle is over. At any rate, at the beginning of the week the 52-year-old Viennese is to be re-elected by the party executive as the FPÖ's top EU candidate. In addition to France's right-winger Marine Le Pen, it was also thanks to Vilimsky that in mid-2015 the extreme right-wing parties from seven states, which until then had been rather disunited, joined together to form a parliamentary group - the ENF, which stands for Europe of Nations and Freedoms, with 37 of 751 mandates."
" Certainly, however, it is a fact that until now the industrialists, in the various governmental structures, had always chosen to forge closer ties with the more moderate and pro-European parties and leaders. This time, however, they opted for a political force such as the League: sovereignist, a bit 'anti-euro, unorthodox in economics, certainly hostile to the European Union.Already on Friday, the leader of the industrialists had appeared very soft in his comments on the overrun of the deficit wanted by the government. You can make more public debt as long as it has a focus on economic growth, employment and less debt, Boccia had said, also speaking of excessive nervousness in the markets."
" Disappointing and unnecessary, reacts VVD MEP Malik Azmani. His colleague Marcel de Graaff of the PVV: The EU may be friends with terrorist regimes and embrace Iran, but the only free democracy in the Middle East, Israel, can only count on hostility.Tehran is held responsible for a kamikaze drone attack last week on a ship off the coast of Oman."
" Eugen Freund was this for 73 per cent of SPÖ voters, Harald Vilimsky for 68 per cent of FPÖ voters, Ulrike Lunacek for 64 per cent of Green voters and Angelika Mlinar only for 59 per cent of NEOS voters. An even stronger motive for ÖVP voters than Karas, however, was that their party best represents Austria's interests in the EU. 85 percent agreed with this. Both Green voters (78 percent) and those of the FPÖ (75 percent) say their party has the greatest credibility to check abuses in the European Union. The strongest motive among NEOS voters for their party was that they provide a credible renewal of politics (82 percent)."
" Europe should be about people , says a spokesperson. VNO-NCW, MKB-Nederland and LTO Nederland are satisfied with the lack of success of anti-EU party PVV. 0"
" Florian Philippot, the ex-FN who left to create Les Patriotes, in favour of a Frexit? Why leave Europe when you can change it from within? In the case of the RN's fictitious employment in the European Parliament, the damage to which is estimated at 7 million euros by the latter and for which people close to Marine Le Pen have been indicted, Frédéric Gojard and Philippe Olivier were careful not to mention the matter. As last year, the departmental secretary also refused to give any figures on the number of Perigord members: ""We reason in terms of dynamics."
" For Steger, a policy was pursued that may sound humane, but in the end was anything but humane, because it led to thousands of deaths and supported the traffickers. The FPÖ's concept provides above all for aid in the vicinity of crisis areas, including protection zones. User Glasskinn asked whether the FPÖ was even in favour of an EU-wide 140 km/h speed limit on motorways. Steger's answer, referring to the test tracks here in Germany: No, but they are very much committed to the research and development of alternative engines."
" Former EU Commissioner Franz Fischler is also involved in the No to Öxit campaign. He says that Austrians are the biggest beneficiaries of the EU and sees this as a mandate to get more involved in the EU.Anti-Öxit campaign widens Haselsteiner campaigns with Ederer, Fischler and Konrad Vienna"
" He wants a guarantee that in the case of massive breaches of the law and possible manipulation of elections, a blank cheque will be given and people will look the other way and remain silent,"" FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache expressed his indignation via Facebook. On Facebook, Strache also philosophised on the subject of an Öxit vote and Hofer's rejection of an EU exit: ""The FPÖ (including Norbert Hofer) is therefore not cancelling Öxit, but rather it was and is always only a last resort if Europe is not finally reformed and renewed,"" Strache wrote on Friday evening. Strache did not want to understand on Saturday that this was interpreted as a whistle blowing."
" He would be a leader on the platforms of EU economic and fiscal power. The President of the Government needs, in order to exhaust the legislature, to receive the bulk of European funds before 2023 with a lax examination of his reforms, since labor, tax and pension reforms will not be the maximum that Brussels would want, since they will have to be agreed with Podemos and its investiture majority. The Spanish socialist leader also requires the EU to allow him a soft path of deficit reduction precisely to be able to maintain a high public expenditure with which to gain support from his parliamentary partners for his Budgets.in both objectives, Lindner would be a serious obstacle and will be decisive in the new German political stage. He is a clear winner of Sunday's general election and indispensable for those who aspire to govern, so he is in a position to demand and he is very clear about the key ministry for his electorate, which is in favor of low taxes, control of public spending and encouragement of private investment: the one that runs Germany's economy and treasury."
" However, the politicians have to deal with the causes. Fear of job loss is one of the main reasons why many vote for the FPÖ. Referring to the EU free movement of persons, he repeated from his Plan A that restrictions must be discussed. Their sage"
" I assume that on certain subjects, I am not yet in the majority in the opinion, recognizes Florian Philippot, who is there to convince of Frexit. The exit from the euro is no longer the priority of the FN, the party he advised until last summer. Fervent supporter of Brexit, British MEP Nigel Farage wished the new party good luck in a video message. Never doubt, even if you have to be patient, because people will tell you it is impossible,"" the Briton warned."
 I respect the opinion of the Hungarians I respect the opinion of the Hungarians The right-wing nationalist to extreme right-wing prominence in the EU spoke out in a joint declaration at the weekend. In the middle of it all: the FPÖ. DER STANDARD spoke with their EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky about his foreign policy plans and the current conflicts within the EU.
" If the European Union has not been effective or swift, it has given rise to doubts, criticism - rarely constructive - and even the temptation to turn towards national solutions. However, the political convulsions of the Brexit in the UK have led even the most Europhobic to soften their stance. The Rassemblement National no longer talks about leaving the euro or the European Union, but officially wants to reorient it from within... A misleading appearance, because the logic of his programme would lead to Frexit by making cooperation in good faith very difficult."
" In Austria, the extreme right-wing party known as the Freedom Party reached 20.7% of the vote in last September's elections and the polls show it growing further, putting the so-called grand coalition between the socialists and the center-right in crisis, which today enjoys a majority of only 50.9%, the lowest since the two parties have been collaborating.In Great Britain, Nigel Farage, the impetuous skeptical Euro MP who has so far, and in just a few years, led his U.K. to victory. Independence Party, after the recent success in the elections in his country (where, opposed by all, has exceeded 20% of the vote) is preparing to give battle against Europe in a country where a theme of this type has always been very popular and was just waiting for a political leader like Nigel Farage to be able to express himself. In Italy are placed on anti-European position both the M5S and the Northern League. Even Forza Italia (which continues to formally declare itself as a pro-EU party) has many polemical reasons against the Brussels establishment, whose arrogance is not the result of an election and which the Europarliament should therefore reduce."
" In fact, its program is the most credible anti-Islamist program. But in the economic field, she oscillates between Montoro and Monedero, with the anti-German and anti-euro moutarde, lethal for the EU and fatal for Spain, but Marine is not alone in the wake of Podemos. When it seemed that only the extreme right could bombard the European Union from the Eiffel Tower, here comes to meet them, like the claws of a giant crab, an extreme left so similar to that of Pablemos that its leader, a Ximo Puig with the big hair of Alfonso Rus, does not feel like calling him Mélenchon, but directly Pablenchon."
" In it, the MEPs called for an end to repression in the Maduro regime and demanded a national dialogue with the participation of democratic forces. That resolution had the support of the four big groups in the European Parliament, the popular, the socialist, the reformist and the liberal, and it called for the immediate release of Leopoldo López, Antonio Ledezma, Daniel Ceballos and the peaceful demonstrators who were arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression.Podemos, portrayedBut that debate in Strasbourg also served to portray the MEPs of Podemos, who rejected the initiative and were embarrassed in front of the entire European Union.Pablo Iglesias' party is not represented in the Congress of Deputies, and therefore will not be able to participate in the vote on the Proposition No of Law that will be agreed, foreseeably, by the vast majority of the House. But the Congress wants to join the condemnation expressed by the EU against the repression of the Maduro regime, and convey an image of unity and strength in favor of the rule of law and freedoms in Venezuela."
" In the same way that the anti-capitalist formation recently requested that the Catalan institutions disregard all the decisions of the Constitutional Court (TC) that affect Catalonia, yesterday invited Barcelona fans to protest in the most sympathetic, friendly and forceful way: wearing estelades to the Cup final at the Calderón.The aspirants of the left to the Presidency of the Government also took advantage of the controversy to attack the decision of the Executive. The secretary general of the PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, accused President Mariano Rajoy of waving flags to hide problems such as the fine of the European Union to Spain for the breach of the deficit target; and the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, attacked the authoritarian and ridiculous tone of the veto to the Estelada.The leader of Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, called for a pact between all to not bring ideological symbols to soccer.None of the interpellations made the government's position change. Its delegate in Madrid stressed that the law is clear and does not allow the introduction of discriminatory elements that negatively influence the development of competitions."
" It is worth adding that yesterday's judgments come a few days after the launch by the government of the Competition Act, a measure where the executive preferred, to avoid fibrillation within the majority, remove the theme of beaches and concessions. It is no coincidence that last night to thunder against the ruling of the Council of State we thought the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini: Beaches and Italian markets are not for sale, resign the bureaucrats of Brussels and their accomplices: the League has never allowed and will not allow our work and our traditions to be canceled. The nervousness and disorientation of the bathers is to be added to that of another category in agitation, the taxi drivers."
" Lastly, a Spanish proposal has been presented, which we could also support for its conformity to our aims, but with some suggestions for variation. Hard the reaction of the League and Fd'I, while M5s seems to align itself with Conte on a softer management of the negotiation at the EU.As for the economic measures to be put in place to deal with the emergency coronavirus, Conte stressed that he is aware that the interventions adopted so far are not sufficient and that there is a need for support to families and businesses extended over time. For this reason, the next decree will allocate a figure not less than 50 billion, which will be added to the 25 already allocated, for a total intervention not less than 75 billion."
" Le Pen recently praised the Five Star Movement of Italian comedian Beppe Grillo and the UK Independence Party of In Brussels, it is feared that the most anti-European European Parliament ever, where everyone puts a national flag on the table, like PVV- and Can a few of these parties follow the Le Pen-Wilders duo in an anti-European bloc?Anti-European parties are eminently national in orientation, and often nationalistic."
" Marine Le Pen's Front National, after the avalanche of consensus in France, had invited all Eurosceptic movements to unite in defense of individual nations. Invitation accepted by the League of Salvini, but not by Grillo, who seems tempted by the alliance with the English Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader who defeated in one fell swoop Cameroon and Labour. We're just probing, Grillo downplays."
" More than two-thirds of our readers believe the EU has been a help to the country, and they are largely opposed to an exit from the Union. Even M5S and Lega supporters are split down the middle on this one, and are by no means monolithically convinced of the no-EU argument. For example, Giuseppe Di Martino, an IT consultant from Maiori, votes for M5S because it is the only young party that puts facts before talk."
" No hollow rhetoric. Many people support the PVV's positions on the EU, immigration and Islam. But they do not agree with the way in which the PVV wants to do something about it."
" Obviously these are policies that help different electorates. M5S, at least in private, is more pragmatic and aware of the limits of fiscal policy; the League is more belligerent in its challenge to the European Union, which imposes discipline. Couldn't the different demographics of the two parties give rise to a new populist coalition, capable of governing Italy and spreading to other European countries? It's difficult, given not only the different structures of the two parties, but also the specific groups and people who expect benefits from their divergent policies. Over time, it may be that one of them will adapt, and be more successful."
" On June 16, 2016, the day before the British referendum on exit, he tweeted adamantly: ,, Now, three years later, the handling of Brexit appears to be chaotic in British politics, the party leader of Forum for Democracy thinks no differently. For the camera of FULL TEXT:"
" On November 22 last year, he himself, along with Le Pen and others, submitted another resolution to keep Turkey out of the EU. For some time now, stories have been circulating that Russians want to blow up the EU from within by facilitating radical-right parties critical of the EU. Former PVV member Wim Kortenoeven denounces the way of working. I think it's a Pavlov response."
" Opinion polls and election results within the EU show that the so-called populist parties are attracting more and more voters. These are mainly parties that are anti-Europe, such as the PVV in the Netherlands, the Front National in France, UKIP in the UK and AfD in Germany. They essentially draw voters who are angry and dissatisfied with their governments' policies."
" Orbán is the link,"" the ID faction says enthusiastically about this development since the Hungarian prime minister made it public that he was holding talks with the Poles and the Italians. The plan of a united right in Strasbourg had already been pursued by FPÖ delegation leader Harald Vilimsky during the EU election campaign. Because of their participation in government in Europe, the Freedom Party was considered acceptable by the conservatives at the time."
" Our commitment will be for the construction of the United States of Europe: I love Italy and that's why I want more Europe, Emma Bonino (+Europa). Orban has a very clear concept of who should be in charge, he gets respect in Europe, Giancarlo Giorgetti (Lega). We will give Europe one last chance, Matteo Salvini (Lega). The European Union is Italy's natural home, Di Maio. The Italian constitution comes before European standards, Giorgia Meloni (F.lli d'Italia)."
" Our goal is the destruction of this EU The FPÖ has joined Le Pen's extreme right group in the EU Parliament and is considered a moderate there Harald Vilimsky is torn these days. On the one hand, the FPÖ General Secretary is a spearhead in Norbert Hofer's election campaign in the race for the office of Federal President against Alexander van der Bellen."
" Palandt will provide insights into this in his lecture on brown comics. Attempts by right-wing parties to appeal to young voters with the help of comics are also well-known: for example, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache repeatedly stylised himself as Superman, who fights against the EU and the Turkish siege. As a counterpoint to this, cartoonists have joined forces to form the Comics Against the Right platform."
" People help each other, but then often vote differently, says Kappel. In terms of content, the group is united by a radical rejection of foreigners in general, Muslims in particular, and a more or less pronounced scepticism towards the EU. In addition, individual FPÖ partners hold radical positions that are difficult or impossible to reconcile with current constitutional standards in Europe. An overview: @J8 Front National."
" Questionable justice In the Republic of Austria there is a member of the FPÖ, Andreas Mölzer, who is running as a top candidate for the EU Parliament, but who believes that the EU is a dictatorship, compared to which the Third Reich was downright liberal and informal. In the Republic of Austria, however, there is also a judiciary that sentenced the publicist Stephan Templ to three years unconditionally for a failure in restitution proceedings."
" So live first, kill the monster first. It is not by chance that the monster is Brussels. The Northern League is betting it all on the European elections in May and that is why Salvini, with Roberto Maroni as director, has decided to launch from Turin the great alliance of Euro-sceptic parties and movements. There are French, Flemish, Dutch, Austrian, Swedish."
" So the other way round and still political, this judgement? In any case, it will be exciting to see which path the FPÖ takes in the coming election campaign. Because the anti-EU line has been lost due to the chaos after the British Brexit vote, its candidate now apparently wants to slip back into the role of the innocent slut: Vote for me, Hofer. I am a victim of manipulation."
" Sources of the conservative formation closed ranks and defended that the party did not go any further, that it would limit itself to claiming the permanence of Junqueras in jail. They warned about the risk of a questioning of European justice and were inclined not to enter the Europhobic terrain of Vox. Santiago Abascal yesterday accused the EU Court of giving oxygen and support to the coup process in Catalonia, spoke of a new humiliation to Spain, demanded the European institutions respect for national sovereignty and did not rule out calling for a great mobilization.. Meanwhile, Ciudadanos, in a position closer to that of the PP, insisted that the European courts neither annul nor question the ruling of the Supreme Court and put the focus on the investiture negotiations to demand a change of partners from Sánchez."
" Surely the cement will have to be that the people feel that the different peoples belong together. Fortuyn's statements stand in stark contrast to the PVV's anti-EU line, where many LPF supporters seem to have taken refuge.."
" The EELV, PS and Génération.s leftists want to preserve the Schengen area but abolish the Dublin Regulation, which provides for the examination of an asylum application in the country of entry of the migrant. The seven candidates in favour of a revision of Schengen are in fact opposed on its finality: it is a question of reinforcing European borders (LREM, UDI), national borders (Les Patriotes), both at the same time (LR, RN, DLF) or of introducing humanitarian visas for refugees (PCF). Opposed to the EU, François Asselineau (UPR) is more divided on Schengen and wants a referendum on the subject."
" The European elections will decide whether there will be majorities in the European Parliament of nationalists and populists who reject European partnership and togetherness at its core. Weber could have been alluding to the coalition partner of his host and party friend - the FPÖ, after all, fits exactly into the political scheme he was referring to. On New Year's Day, Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen and his Finnish visitor, counterpart Sauli Niinistö, also addressed the EU election: In May, they said, it would be decided whether Europe would play a role on the global level in the future or whether it would be the plaything of other powers. Europe was in danger of weakening itself."
 The FPÖ has the best relations with her and congratulated her on the 13 per cent in the elections.Bad company The FPÖ is an anti-EU party.
 The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis has already warned that the budget standard must not lead to the Netherlands cutting itself off from public finances. The PVV does not tolerate interference from Brussels anyway. The SP opposes in advance the neoliberal line dictated by Brussels.
" The aim is to bring as many EU critics as possible under one roof Standard: The FPÖ was previously in total opposition to the EU as a member of the Le Pen group in the European Parliament, has that changed with its entry into government?Vilimsky:"
" The clammers are jubilant because in this way they will be able to avoid heavy fines, seizures and the concrete risk of interrupting their activity for a question of millimeters. Due to climate change, the population of bivalve molluscs in the Adriatic Sea is changing and clams are getting smaller and smaller; therefore, even an apparently irrelevant difference such as the one between 2.2 and 2.5 centimeters of minimum size, shifts the balance of many companies.It will be recalled that the too restrictive measures for clams imposed by Brussels has been one of the favorite battle horses of the Secretary of the League, Matteo Salvini, against the Eurobureaucrats; on this topic the Carroccio leader has also intervened during the last electoral campaign of the administrative elections, in particular when he ploughed the squares of Adriatic cities such as Chioggia in the province of Venice and Cattolica in Rimini, both municipalities then ended up in the hands of grilline.Tuttavia, va detto che la vicenda è raramente stata raccontata fino fondo dai politici. In his battle against the obtuse European norms (a battle carried on in other ways by the associations of producers and by the Mipaaf itself), Salvini has often forgotten to say that the minimum size of 25 millimeters was imposed in Italy back in 1968 by a presidential decree of the then head of state, Giuseppe Saragat (art."
" The contrast between Berlusconi and the sovereignist couple Meloni&Salvini has been evident regarding the Mes, even if all three have dampened any reading of the sinking of the center-right. While the Fd'It and the League have been flailing in their opposition to the EU, with the strongest accents expressed by the most anti-Euro and most vehemently anti-European exponents in the Carroccio, the Cav has constantly recalled its place in the PPE and the sharing of the lines of support discussed in Brussels. Promptly followed these indications the most anti-legislative and the most pro-European among the blue (as well as traditionally obsequious to Angela Merkel), Antonio Tajani, for years the holder of the continental policy forzista. There is no lack of availability to Giuseppe Conte, with explicit recognition by the latter, not surprisingly interviewed by Il Giornale."
 The end of the Brettljause A recurring rumour from Brussels even got politicians in Styria on their toes in 1999. FPÖ politicians protested vehemently against EU hygiene rules that would allegedly ban Brettljausen. The truth was: there was actually a new hygiene regulation that advised against using wood in the preparation of food.
" The fact that the parties that want less Europe are in profit in almost every country in the Union, three-quarters of you label it a good thing. Some more MEPs from, say, the PVV, the Front National (France) and the UK Independence Party (Britain) would do Brussels good, many believe. Unsavory Voting as Eurosceptically as possible may help a little bit , one participant thinks."
" The long road to this debate began nearly two years ago, when Baudet and a number of other publicists began collecting the necessary 40,000 signatures. Meanwhile, Baudet leads the new party Forum for Democracy, which is highly critical of the EU. So the debate fell at a convenient time for him."
" The supporters of Samsom and Pechtold are fortunately less Europhile and gullible than the gentlemen themselves , says Wilders. Departure For Wilders, the most important outcome is that a majority of those questioned (55%) is in favour of leaving the EU if this creates extra economic growth and jobs. Not only do almost all PVV voters (97%) agree, but the supporters of the VVD (58%) and the SP (70%) are also in favor of a departure if it provides economic gain. PVV leader Wilders finds the outcome overwhelming."
" There must be a clear election recommendation , said CDU MEP Elmar Brok to the Standard. He is the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the EU Parliament. He said the election result was a consequence of the Vienna government's attempt to follow the FPÖ instead of taking a clear stance against it on Europe and migration."

" This pact, which is meant to be a new beginning, is in fact a false start,"" said Eve Geddie, head of the EU office at Amnesty International. The EU migration package would raise even more walls and strengthen fences, Geddie said. The FPÖ MEP Roman Haider, on the other hand, spoke of a sham package that would encourage mass migration and promote trafficking in human beings. The Visegrád states Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia also reject the EU Commission's latest proposal for a common European migration policy."
" This, he added, would not leave Spain isolated internationally, but would be making its own foreign policy and not subordinate. In his opinion, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has lost its meaning and, in addition, being part of it has to do with what is happening to Spanish farmers because of the Russian veto. The leader of Podemos alluded to the Russian veto on European agricultural exports due to EU sanctions as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.Iglesias hopes that his party will have a program as soon as possible - we need it - and insisted that this program will be the basis for any post-electoral agreement. According to what he said, Podemos is not sectarian and will be willing to agree with whoever wants to put an end to revolving doors, make a tax reform so that the big fortunes pay taxes or create more positions for tax inspectors to fight fraud.Police-Civil Guard UnionAsk about what would be his policy regarding the State Security Forces, Pablo Iglesias said that, in line with what members of the Unified Police Union (SUP) and the Unified Association of the Civil Guard (AUGC) have told him, he would be willing to open the debate on the unification of the different forces and listen to the experts."
" Trying to follow Paris by raising the cost of pensions and benefits - permanently, not for one year - risks proving to be a painful illusion. It is likely, however, that the calculation of the leaders of the League and 5 Stars is more about politics than public finance. They predict that the EU Commission will let Macron's budget go through but reject theirs, calling on them to rewrite it in line with the rules. For Salvini and Di Maio, the temptation to present themselves at the European elections brandishing accusations against Brussels, painting it as an accomplice of Paris and unequal to Italy; strong with their new insurrectionists - according to their version - but weak with the strong European establishment."
" Ultimately, however, the arguments for withdrawal would not have withstood scrutiny.National Council rejected referendum on EU exit FPÖ demanded a non-binding referendum on EU membership without success."
" While Abascal called for a firm hand with the immigrants -whom he called soldiers of Morocco- and even to paralyze the nationalizations of all Moroccans, Casado aligned himself with the pro-European postulates and called for a diplomatic solution. It was very forceful, but in the diplomatic line of the EU. Both the PP and Vox agree that Spain must immediately return all immigrants who have entered Ceuta irregularly this week. And both consider this to be an attack on Spanish sovereignty."
" You bet it will. Luckily for Dell Boy and The Cartridge Family, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste kindly did them a favour yesterday afternoon by coming into the House and announcing that a referendum will be held on the EU fiscal treaty.But the Sinn Féin font of political virtue is badly damaged even the sanctimonious blot their copybook."
" You have to do something anyway. n PVVThe PVV's new TV spot is a 2 minute and 55 second lament about the European Union. With threatening music in the background, Geert Wilders warns about the billions in aid to Southern Europe, the Brussels bureaucracy and Mark Rutte who would sell out the Netherlands."
" ""After reflection, the Dutch have come to the conclusion that the European Union is a strength and that extremist nationalism is a danger,"" commented the former Belgian Prime Minister. It remains to be seen what impact a disappointing PVV score would have on the ambitions of European Eurosceptics, such as the National Front, with whom Geert Wilders has formed an alliance.

" ,,Brussels has never wanted to offer a good win-win deal to London. It had to and would become an agreement that would scare other countries considering an exit from the EU. For years, his PVV party advocated a Nexit: the Netherlands out of the EU. That's still what we stand behind."
" ,,So we are against a big third aid package for Greece. The VVD leader received fierce criticism from Geert Wilders, whose PVV wants the Netherlands to leave the EU itself. Wilders: ,,Mr. Rutte is dreaming in Greek, of course he is going to pay."
" ,,The Netherlands should have acted more generously, not as a self-centered troublemaker, he said yesterday at a jubilee meeting of The Hague's Nieuwspoort Society. The Netherlands has antagonized many EU member states by insisting on strict budget rules. The PVV reporting point for nuisance caused by Central and Eastern Europeans also drew bad blood. Van Agt thinks it will be difficult to improve the image of the Netherlands as long as Wilders is the supporting partner of VVD and CDA."
" - Brexit: make or break A new populist wave feared in the European ParliamentPopulism is gaining ground across Europe. Whether they are anti-system like the RN or the 5-Star Movement, nationalist like Hungary's Fidesz or outright far-right like Germany's AfD, they have made progress and even come to power in Italy and Austria. What impact will this have in the European Parliament? While the rise of the extremes is likely, the Europhobic wave could be less impressive than in 2014 in terms of seats."
" - However, there are left-wing currents that propose an exit from the EU. - I am absolutely convinced that the idea of leaving the European Union will not be maintained by those who are currently in charge of Podemos. - Can the populist current sweeping through Europe have any influence? - I do not agree with this assessment."
" - In the worst case, it will mean Poland's exit from the European Union, he added. PiS is jeopardizing our membership in the EU not to defend sovereignty, but for its own narrow political interest - defending its people on the judges' stools. This is a cynical sacrifice of the public good for the sake of political privatism. - commented constitutionalist prof."
" - Returning to the past and restricting women's rights is not the right option - and this time, Commissioner Dalli hid behind a phrase she has used many times before in the European Parliament. - Have you seen ultrasound pictures with your baby from the sixth, seventh, eighth month of pregnancy? Have you seen a beating heart yearning for life? Abortion is a drama, murder of a child - said Jadwiga Wisniewska (Law and Justice party), also emphasizing the lack of authority of the EU concerning the abortion issue. It has even been invoked by some right-wing MEPs from those countries where abortion has long been widely available."
" - Strache's claim that the Blue Party is the party that will never tolerate the abuse of power was also lost. No more 18 per cent in Carinthia, no more eight per cent in Lower Austria, plus the billionaire tribune of the people and the orange dwarf fishing in the same pond of voters - in view of this situation, the FPÖ leader urgently needs to come up with more for the National Council elections than anti-EU slogans and strong language against the upper echelons, because Stronach and the BZÖ also have that.Strache tweeted somewhat desperately to his fan community: ""Everything in life has and makes sense! And admonishingly in the direction of his own ranks: Where there are corruption charges, the consequences must also be drawn by resignation."
" - The biggest grudge I have against the MPs from the Law and Justice party is that they act contrary to the Polish raison d'état - he says. - As members of the European Conservatives and Reformists faction, which is led by the British Tories, they are in favour of reducing the budget and limiting the EU to the common market, which would affect smaller countries, Lewandowski added. For them, the only projects that count are those with which they can pamper voters in their own regions."
 - The reform is in progress - emphasized the Deputy Speaker of the Senate Marek Pek. There is a belief in the Law and Justice party that the abolition of the Disciplinary Chamber is no longer enough to resolve the conflict with the EU over the rule of law. Matthew Morawiecki steps into Ziobra's shoes.
" - This must be clear: the primacy of EU law applies in our Union. CJEU rulings are binding on all national courts, she said, stressing that this applies to all EU members.She thus referred to the discussion in Poland. The Law and Justice Party has long questioned moves by EU institutions, which have criticized the ruling camp for violating the rule of law and dismantling democracy. When the CJEU suspended the Supreme Court's new Disciplinary Chamber in early April, the Law and Justice (PiS) government decided to veto the party's subordinate Constitutional Court."
" - Treaties in no small part cease to apply, or are used pretextually. The principle of equality of states is also being violated and in a very drastic way - says the Law and Justice president. He also announces an attempt to reform the EU, but carried out on the principle of equality of sovereign states. This, in turn, may be difficult, especially since they both see the issue of the judiciary very differently."
" -, a relatively monocausal but perhaps for that very reason highly efficient electoral machinery and the constant plebiscitary feedback to the vox populi. And, of course, the continuity of content, for example in questions of immigration criticism and EU scepticism. But the parallels are already exhausted. The rise of the Haider FPÖ took place in a completely different global environment. The collapse of real existing socialism - accompanied by a Europe-wide upheaval in the party system - made the break-up of the red-black proportional representation system appear to be part of a larger process of political change."
" Civilising globalisation According to him, only the Franco-German couple would be able to give impetus to a community management of migratory flows. How, indeed, can one claim to respond to the injunction of Kishore Mahbubani, the great Singaporean diplomat, according to whom Europe's mission is to civilise globalisation, without first civilising its own borders?If the debate emerges within the framework of this European campaign, it is still through the prism of parties like the FN. We in the UMP are in direct opposition to the FN on this issue,"" said Alain Lamassoure, UMP leader in Île-de-France."
" The values of Poland and the EU are the same. If it were otherwise, we would not have joined the EU. - constitutionalist Professor Marcin Matczak commented on the case. PiS is jeopardizing our membership in the EU not for the sake of defending sovereignty, but for its narrow political interest - defending its people on the judges' stools. It's a cynical sacrifice of the public good, - he added."
" There are important and paradoxical restrictions to this: the report may not be used as campaign material. But the question is whether this is possible at all: now that the PVV is working so openly towards the European campaign, as today with the visit of Marine Le Pen of the Front National to The Hague, a study like this automatically has a high attention value for everyone involved in the European campaign. Incidentally, the Presidium of the House can still formally reject the PVV's grant application."
" ,,For many years we lived with 28 people in one house. With the departure of the British, that suddenly becomes 27, but that does not automatically mean that the house suddenly becomes cheaper. Verhoeven urges Rutte to take that sense of reality to Brussels.Idiotic proposalsOnly in the opposition there is criticism. The PVV calls the proposal of the European Commission through member of parliament Vicky Maeijer also unacceptable. She wants the Netherlands to use its veto power to get these idiotic proposals off the table."
" According to the rules, Le Pen and Wilders need parties from at least seven countries. Three weeks after the EU elections, the counter still stands at five: FN, PVV, Vlaams Belang, the Austrian FPÖ and the Italian Lega Nord. In the search for new parties, there are hijackers on the coast, such as the anti-Europe faction of the British UKIP leader"
" Adams devoted a lot of his opening speech to Brexit, arguing for the Taoiseach to be more abrasive in defending this island's interests. The Brexit debate has put Sinn Féin into a bit of a quandary. The party has been traditionally suspicious of Europe but has evolved its position to one of a disciple, but on the Doubting Thomas side of things."
" After the EU law is found to be unconstitutional, Poland has three options: amend the constitution, seek to amend the EU law, or withdraw from the EU, the pre-Julia Przylebska era ECJ ruled. But the PiS government has a different plan: it wants to stay in the EU without recognizing some of the CJEU rulings. 8. The European Commission said it would defend the integrity of EU law and its uniform application: Europeans' rights under the Treaties must be protected no matter where in the EU they live."
" Also their voting habits are sometimes inscrutable. In November, for example, the PVV voted against a resolution that sought to put an end to the costly monthly travelling circus of the parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg, perhaps the greatest annoyance of Eurosceptics. The PVV's argument: the resolution actually argued for more concentration of power in Brussels, and they don't want that. The European elections in the Netherlands seem to end in a battle between PVV, VVD and D66. But it is possible that this prognosis, made by the European institute Pollwatch and dating from March 6, can be overturned given the crisis within the PVV and the wind that seems to blow in D66's back."
" Anti-European group in the making Geert Wilders' PVV and Marine Le Pen's Front National seem determined to form a single euro faction soon. In November, they announced in The Hague that they would be working together."
" As long as that remains, it's free shooting for anti-Europe populists and anyone who sees the abuses in the labor market. Not every PVV agenda item is automatically abject. The European Union prides itself on its identity as a community of words. Then the same should apply to labor conditions."
" At the minute, it makes perfect sense for Sinn Féin to talk about an all-Ireland agenda. That's a much more difficult argument to sustain, from their point of view, if part of Ireland is no longer in the European Union. It becomes a more difficult sell for them. Oddly enough, for Sinn Féin at this stage, the status quo suits them perfectly.Whatever the rationale, Sinn Féin finds itself on the side of the main bodies representing the business and farming communities, with both the Northern Ireland arm of the Confederation of British Industry and the Ulster Farmers' Union warning of the dire consequences of withdrawal."
" Austria's first EU Commissioner in Brussels, Franz Fischler (ÖVP), who was responsible for agriculture from 1995 to 2004, on the other hand, when asked by the STANDARD about his opinion on Kurz's EU views on paternalism and bureaucracy, would only say the absolute minimum, namely: no comment. Erhard Busek, who celebrated Austria's EU accession in June 1994 as ÖVP leader and vice-chancellor in the SPÖ tent, singing along loudly to the Internationale, interpreted Kurz's latest EU statements in the STANDARD interview as a balancing remark to Vilimsky. The FPÖ's top candidate promises to bring competences back to Austria from Brussels. On Kurz's 1000 allegedly superfluous regulations, Busek says: ""I think the statement that the EU regulates too much is simply not true."
" Backhanded compliment Sinn Féin may find the backhanded compliment from Farage unwelcome but it is not the first time the two forces have found common ground. Back in 2012 during the referendum on the EU Fiscal Treaty, which Sinn Féin strongly campaigned against, McDonald and Farage appeared together calling for a No vote in a national radio debate on Today FM chaired by Matt Cooper. Incidentally, another bizarre link between the Brexit Party and Sinn Féin has become something of an election issue in the"
" Blunt The Coalition's own leaflet, being delivered to every house in the country this week, says bluntly it is necessary to ratify the treaty to continue to be able to access the EU bailout fund. But this claim about the bailout fund is disputed by Sinn Fein on the No side. The independent Referendum Commission will support the Government's view by stating the treaty says access to the fund is based upon ratification."
" But in many countries there is a willingness to do so: Because it is easier to market, people in Germany are now talking about an army of Europeans instead of an army of Europe. Right at the start of the year, Defence Minister Mario Kunasek (FPÖ) made it clear that the Republic would not participate in a common EU army: ""One uniform, one leadership - that's not going to happen,"" he declared, referring to the EU's ""own"" army.Austria's neutrality."
" But the anti-Europe mood is getting worse. From PVV to SP. For too long, we've pushed the things we don't like to Brussels. We also did not defend and sell enough Europe and then you get these sentiments."
" But these are actually self-evident. It must be specifically emphasised because one of the government partners is the FPÖ. As an EU-sceptical party, it remains the weak link from the EU partner's point of view as long as it is an active member of the ENF group of extreme right-wing parties in the EU Parliament. It was more than piquancy that the dissolution of the EU was called for at the ENF Congress in Prague when FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache presented the coalition pact with Kurz in Vienna."
" But yes, no one checking. Also something that the PVV has gotten worked up about more often. The party was for a long time the white raven in Brussels when it came to claiming office expenses. A white raven has a right to speak when he is critical of abuses in Brussels."
" Canada, the EU's 12th biggest trading partner, is understood to be increasingly frustrated with the delays to the deal which was signed off in principle by member states two years ago. The controversy also threatens to seriously undermine the EU's reputation as a trade negotiator. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy urged the Government to drop its support for the agreement, and commended the parliament of Walloon for rejecting the toxic deal.. This is further evidence that CETA and TTIP [the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal] have no popular support and shows what can happen when even small nations or regions are given a democratic say on the issue, he said."
" Celebrities and Foot People Among the more prominent cases that have become known since 2013 is Andreas Mölzer, long-time editor of the FPÖ-affiliated publication Zur Zeit and former EU parliamentarian. In 2014, he first caused a stir by saying something about the EU, which he described as a Negro conglomerate (which he later denied, saying necrophile conglomerate), and a few weeks later with racist statements about footballer David Alaba."
" Consistent opposition For instance, Sinn Féin campaigned for a No vote in every EU referendum in the history of this State. The party did back Remain in the UK referendum, but that probably had as much to do with the fact that the DUP was on the other side as anything else."
" Despite what Baudet says in front of the cameras, the hard Nexit line officially disappeared from the books. The election program for the 2017 parliamentary elections still stated unequivocally: Forum for Democracy believes that the EU is unreformable and therefore favors a Nexit. That stanza has, on the website, since been toned down to: FvD is therefore in favor of a referendum on membership of the European Union.According to Henk Otten, the European election program, accepted by the congress in November, is now leading."
" Double top in the election campaign For the blue EU election campaign, the FPÖ chairman announced a dual leadership alongside the experienced Free Party MEP Andreas Mölzer and a younger candidate. However, the FPÖ will only announce details in January."
" Double top in the election campaign For the blue EU election campaign, the FPÖ chairman announced a dual leadership alongside the experienced Free Party MEP Andreas Mölzer, and that there should be a younger candidate. However, the FPÖ will only announce details in January."
" Even Neos party leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger wants Europe to stand together here. She expressly welcomed the Merkel-Macron plan. The FPÖ has traditionally been critical of the EU. Harald Vilimsky, head of the Freedom Party delegation in the European Parliament, said that Merkel and Macron were planning a cash gift for countries that have not had their budgets under control for years."
" Far from waning, the populist and xenophobic wave continues to sweep through Europe's ballot boxes. The anti-Brussels and anti-immigration themes that the FN has been carrying for decades are more popular than ever. Even if the champions of Brexit and the winners of the Italian elections are not sure what to do with their victory."
" Finally, he proves once and for all that he has nothing to do with facts and figures and that responsible politics is not even feasible with him. At the same time, he proves once and for all that the SPÖ of today is just as much in need of reform and reorganisation as the EU of today. And Kurz? He is increasingly experiencing first-hand what has happened to the FPÖ for decades when it has put constructive ideas and overdue reform proposals on the table. I'm pretty sure Kurz can take it and will draw the logical conclusions."
" For its part, Labour will be under pressure in England and Wales to shift its policies towards the centre but the party will be unable to win back support in Scotland unless it chimes with the more left-wing mood there. The SNP wants a separate vote on EU membership for Scotland if Cameron's referendum goes ahead (a demand echoed by Sinn Féin for Northern Ireland). And a British decision to leave the EU would almost certainly trigger a second Scottish referendum on independence."
" Hard border It would help to avoid a hard border in Ireland and maintain frictionless trade with the UK, he will say. Prof Kinsella will argue that leaving the EU is essential to take back Ireland's military neutrality, which he argues is compromised by membership of EU battle groups and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (Pesco) defence initiative .The notion of an Irish exit from the EU has only become a topic for public discussion in the wake of the Brexit vote in the UK. All of the established political parties are supporters of the EU, while Sinn Féin has moved from being an EU-sceptical party to being an EU-critical party. It is seen by some to have softened its stance to Brussels considerably since Brexit."
" However, the agreement on the EU budget, which will see the overall size of the fund for the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reduced as a result of the UK ceasing its contribution after Brexit, was criticised by Sinn Féin and other Opposition TDs. But Mr Martin insisted Irish farmers would be protected, and said the special EUR 5 billion fund for countries affected by Brexit would yield significant resources for Ireland.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Cavan-Monaghan TD Matt Carthy both criticised the new budget as representing a 10 per cent cut in CAP, and accused Mr Martin of failing to protect Irish farmers.When people say it is good for Europe, we are Europe."
" Ideological is also the support for Putin from right-wing populist parties in Europe. With these parties, the aversion to Brussels is almost automatically a choice for Moscow. All of the parties with which the PVV tried unsuccessfully to form an anti-European group this year are decidedly pro-Russian, the French Front National (FN) at the forefront. For them, Putin's Russia represents the sovereign, powerfully managed nation-state that they themselves aspire to."
" In a letter to the Lower House, Minister Koenders (Foreign Affairs, PvdA) wrote on Monday that the cabinet believes that the shortest possible period of uncertainty regarding the British intentions is desirable . In his letter, Koenders states that the signal from the British electorate should be taken seriously. According to him, we should continue to work on a European Union that focuses on essentials. At the end of the debate it became clear that there is hardly any support in the Lower House for a referendum on a possible exit of the Netherlands from the European Union. A motion by PVV leader Wilders calling on the government to hold such a Nexit referendum seemed to enjoy the support of only ex-PVV members Joram van Klaveren and Louis Bontes and 50Plus leader Henk Krol. The motion will be voted on later this Tuesday."
" In this fight, the government is supported by both the Danish People's Party and the Social Democrats, who also do not believe that it is a matter for the EU. Maternity leave is a matter for the individual countries, and we can easily handle it ourselves, says gender equality spokesperson for the DF Karina Adsbøl. The EU should completely stay out of this, she says, explaining that the problem is both the EU's interference and the idea of earmarked maternity leave itself. The family itself is best placed to organise and distribute this, says Karina Adsbøl."
" Last year, 206,548 persons received child benefits, of which 71,308 were not Austrian citizens. FPÖ social spokesman Herbert Kickl sees unrestrained immigration from EU Eastern states and the refugee movement as reasons for the rising numbers of non-Austrians receiving benefits."
" Lastly, the topic of expanding direct democracy was still open. In any case, the ÖVP and the FPÖ have agreed not to hold a referendum on Austria's exit from the EU. The EU Commissioner currently appointed by the ÖVP will remain with the ÖVP."
" Leader PVV in Brussels happy with anti-EU position Wilders Madlener (43) is very pleased that his party leader has once again thrown the cudgel into the fire. And a farewell to Brussels is achievable, says the comrade of PVV leader Wilders.,,The European Convention provides for voluntary withdrawal."
" Lower cost of migration The Netherlands would spend less money on migrants if it did not have to comply with EU migration rules. Like the PVV, proponents of a Brixit are advocating a model in which the UK - like Australia - can choose which migrants to take on for which jobs. But for the United Kingdom (and the Netherlands), this may prove difficult."
" Nevertheless, Austrians' opinion of EU membership has remained more or less stable over two decades. All this against the background of the recent euro crisis and the constant anti-EU propaganda of the Krone & FPÖ alliance, which once more, once less clearly propagate leaving at least the euro, if not the EU itself. So the right-wing populist bluster doesn't really matter (and the fear of the crown is rather superfluous)."
" NoPeil Jan Roos stood with Thierry Baudet (Forum for Democracy) at the cradle of the advisory referendum on the Association Treaty between the EU and Ukraine: the first European issue to emerge after the acceptance of the Referendum Act by the Senate. Under the brand name GeenPeil, this unlikely clown duo (Bert Wagendorp) collected over 472 thousand signatures."
" Not blackmail with Kosovo Serbian media wrote in the run-up to Hofer's visit that the FPÖ was demanding that Serbia not be blackmailed with Kosovo . The background: The EU wants both states to be able to join only if they eliminate all bilateral problems. In Kosovo, people fear negative repercussions in the event of Hofer's election victory."

" Only one thing is and remains sustainable: accepting that overcoming the crisis will be a difficult process that will only be achieved if we attack the origins of the crisis, which are the horrendous debts and a lack of competitiveness in some European countries, she said. Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty warned that the fiscal treaty would allow the EU Commission to dictate the content of future Irish budgets if the country did not balance its books. It is shocking that any state would voluntarily cede such economic sovereignty, he said."
" Political leaders in The Hague also read studies that show that it is precisely among poorer and less educated groups that discontent is growing about Europe, globalization, migration, the elite. And they see how the PVV is growing in the polls, as are many other right-wing, anti-EU and anti-migration parties in Europe. Of the seven party leaders in this story - PVV leader Geert Wilders did not want to participate - no one doubts it: growing inequality will be an important theme, perhaps the theme, in the campaign for the Lower House elections next spring at the latest."
 SPÖ club leader Andreas Schieder with a piece of the Iron Curtain dismantled in 1989 stressed: Europe needs common answers but not new fences around countries. Green MEP Ulrike Lunacek also reminded the FPÖ in particular that all 28 of us are Europe. Solidarity is only possible together.
" Secretary General Harald Vilimsky declared the FPÖ the winner of the election early in the evening.Strache just before the blue miracle Everything wears scarves with the inscription Aus Liebe zur Heimat , everything cheers and shouts Ha-Ze! Ha-Ze! as the first projection sends the blue column soaring."
" Since 2009, there have been about 60 MEPs who fit the description of right-wing populist Eurosceptics, out of a total of 766. Unlike other like-minded people, such as Christian or Social Democrats, they are not in one group. Over half are in the Europe for Freedom and Democracy group, including Ukip and the Italian Lega Nord. The rest are non-aligned: the four PVV members, along with the FN and the British BNP labeled as fascist, among others. All of these people's representatives are in a split, observes Marley Morris of the British research firm Counterpoint."
" Somewhat hypocritical Given this dominant trade tradition, the scorn Raymond de Roon (PVV) is garnering Monday with his suggestion that EU sanctions against Russia are not working and therefore should be reconsidered sounds a bit hypocritical. But it does mark how thick the dividing line is that MH17 has drawn."
" Speaking at the launch of his party's manifesto for the elections yesterday, Mr Martin said there was a real possibility that Ireland could send to the parliament MEPs who [have] a fundamentally anti-EU position and . . . will spend endless hours pursuing false conspiracies about EU militarisation. In a reference to Midland North West MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Mr Martin said one of our MEPs has been almost unchallenged with his calls for Ireland to follow Britain with Brexit and go out of the EU. On Sinn Féin, he said this party had consistently been fomenting an anti-EU approach and they take stances within EU parliament which is concerning in my view. He said Sinn Féin had been soft on Russia in the way that Russia seeks to undermine the European Union."
" Standard: How is the SPÖ doing? Does it have to fear the FPÖ? Darabos: We are predicted to get 25 percent in the EU elections, the FPÖ is at 22, and the Greens and the Neos are battling it out for fourth place at 13 to 14 percent. This survey took place at the time when Freund's statements were already being discussed intensively in the media."
 Standard: The FPÖ is criticised for its membership in the group of extreme right parties in the EU Parliament. Why are you in this group?
 Standard: The FPÖ is still in the European Parliament in a group with far-right parties that want to break up the EU. Is this compatible with Austria's position in the EU?
" Stephen Collins arrogantly and offensively calls those Irish voters who rejected the Nice and Lisbon Treaties by exercising their democratic right slow learners, and the implication of his article is that people like us and the views of the people who voted for us have no place in the European Parliament. We won't claim to speak on behalf of Luke Ming Flanagan or Sinn Féin who are well able to speak up for themselves, although it is quite remarkable that anyone would view Sinn Féin as Eurosceptic, particularly in relation to Brexit. But we will defend ourselves, our position in relation to the EU and the very constructive and positive work we have done since we were democratically elected to the European Parliament by the people of Dublin and Ireland South."
" That's why I wonder who wants to risk a sharp downturn in the economy in exchange for a mirage of rather paltry economic gains in 2035. By then, Wilders himself will be well into his seventies and retired. For me the conclusion is clear: this report serves to mobilize disgruntled voters, not to really get the Netherlands out of the EU. Because if it goes wrong, Wilders himself gets the blame. Rob de Wijk The PVV wants mainly to mobilize voters and not really get the Netherlands out of the EU0"
" The EU institutions demonstratively stayed out of it. Nevertheless, the hyper-patriotic slogan of EU sanctions was born in Austria.Uand today? An ÖVP hybrid under Sebastian Kurz is negotiating with the FPÖ about a Turkish-Blue coalition. It is not only the party colour of the People's Party that has changed, but practically all circumstances."
 The EU's bad name is disastrous in view of the European elections in 3 months. Stoiber points to the strong rise of populist parties like Wilders' PVV and the Front National. Together they represent 25 percent of that part of the EU that fundamentally rejects integration.. Thousands are constantly making new rules in Brussels - Edmond Stoiber
 The Government and Sinn Fein were involved in heated exchanges over the contents of the treaty. Sinn Fein claimed the country would still be able to access the EU bailout funds if the treaty was rejected in the referendum. But the treaty contains a clause excluding any country that fails to ratify it from availing of a bailout in the future.
" The head of the list of the far-right formation, Jordan Bardella, 23, also took the floor, and focused his attacks on the Republicans, whose list is now credited with 14% of voting intentions. The Republicans say they are against migrants in towns and villages, and then go and vote for their distribution in the European Parliament. In the polls, the RN, neck and neck with Lrem, is sailing between 21 and 24% of voting intentions. Marine Le Pen has set a target from the start of the campaign: first place, as in 2014. Her party had, then, captured nearly 25% of the vote."
" The new shooting star of Dutch politics, the right-wing populist Thierry Baudet, is striking a new chord. Austria's right-wing governing party, the FPÖ, is more cautious with its demands. As a bargaining chip for the EU election campaign, the Blue Party prefers to return to the issue of migration. The FPÖ sees itself as a reform party critical of the EU, emphasises Harald Vilimsky, Secretary General, MEP and election campaign manager."
" The opposition does not like the budgetary supplement at all. The Greens consider the measures to be implausible, the FPÖ sees the budget as built on sand. Neos comment: The government wants to avoid a slap in the face from Brussels before the EU elections."
" The strength of the radical left . . . has colonised the anti-establishment sentiment and taken it in a more progressive direction, but I don't think for a minute that we are immune from the potential [rise of far-right politics], he said. Sinn Féin, the nationalist party that might once have been a natural home for anti-EU voters, believes the best way to address concerns about the EU is to reform from within by finding common cause with like-minded people with a more progressive agenda, said the party's Brexit spokesman, David Cullinane. I don't think there is the space or appetite in Ireland for a mainstream party like Ukip emerging simply because they have left Britain in a very bad and dangerous place, said Cullinane."
" They are close to their desired referendum. The EU Citizens Committee, weblog GeenStijl and the Forum for Democracy with the referendum initiative 'GeenPeil'. Just yesterday they said they needed 11,000 of the required 300,000 signatures for an advisory referendum on the EU's association agreement with Ukraine."
" This is why the SPÖ is also pushing for a rescue package for the entire art business as well as basic security for artists and, and, and. Next, the Europe lesson initiated by the FPÖ drifts away from the content, in which the Freedom Party wants to denounce the EU financing madness, which obviously means the reconstruction aid for particularly corona-crisis-ridden states, in which the Republic, above all Kurz, Blümel and Co, together with the three other net contributors, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, does not exactly want to distinguish itself as a generous benefactor under the slogan loans instead of subsidies. Blue Theme Miss"
" Timmermans II EU leads us ever closer to the abyss According to Foreign Minister Timmermans, the PVV's idea that the Netherlands should leave the EU puts our trade at risk (AD 20-2). In my opinion, the government along with all the supporters of the European Union are putting the Netherlands at risk."
" Van der Bellen sees the upcoming exchange of posts between Johanna Mikl-Leitner and Wolfgang Sobotka as a normal castling in a governing party. He does not see any weighty reason not to nominate Sobotka as minister. FPÖ candidate Hofer reiterated his opposition to the EU. If Austria were not a member today and wanted to join, I would vote no"", he said."
" What about red-blue in the federal government? If one were to take a purely pragmatic approach, a compromise could probably be found. An SPÖ trimmed to a restrictive course on foreigners and asylum, which also works subliminally with criticism of the EU, would find at least as much common ground with the FPÖ as with the ÖVP. In politics, however, emotions play a role that should not be underestimated."
" What are the disadvantages? For Forum and the PVV there are many disadvantages to Ceta, but the biggest disadvantage they find is that it is an EU treaty: a restriction on Dutch sovereignty, and so these parties vote against it. Clash of worldviews"
" Where not only Spindelegger would have to pack his bags, but also The FPÖ finds it difficult to mobilise its supporters because they are even less interested in the EU than anyone else, but saying no and shouting about it is apparently also a programme that people can get enthusiastic about. It would be a task to do something about this and should be motivation enough for the two coalition parties to do more, if only in their own interest."
" Wilders is in many ways a national-populist as almost every European country has one these days. It is nationalistic like Marine Le Pen of the Front National in France, and it seeks to connect with feelings of voter discontent and frustration about Europe, immigration and the elite, like a Nigel Farage of UKIP in the United Kingdom. And the PVV wants to leave the welfare state untouched as the Southern European left-wing protest movements want. Just like other protest movements, from the left and right, Wilders does not resign himself to the narrow margins that the classical middle parties in Europe are content with: they wage their mutual battles within the agreements on European budgetary discipline, international treaties and the limits of the rule of law, financial markets and economic calculation models."
" Wilders must call Proponents of a Nexit, such as PVV leader Geert Wilders, dismiss this fact as EU propaganda and point to countries such as Switzerland and Norway that they believe are complete masters at home and are doing well outside the EU. Wilders needs to make a phone call to the Brexit camp who will quickly disabuse him of the dream."
" Wire from Linz to Moscow Gudenus is considered one of the string pullers of the FPÖ Moscow axis. He is on the spot when it comes to demanding an end to the sanctions imposed by the EU or protecting Russia from suspicion, for example in the case of the poisoned Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal.He benefits from having studied at the MGIMO diplomatic college in Moscow, an important cadre of Russian politics."
" Yet Mr Adams remains only the third most popular leader, with just a 35pc satisfaction rating, reflecting his struggles to adapt to life as a TD and opposition party leader in the Dail. However, the party has benefited from a boost to its profile from leading the opposition to the EU fiscal treaty referendum. Sinn Fein's support is at its highest in Connaught-Ulster at 24pc, following by Munster at 17pc, Dublin on 15pc and the rest of Leinster on 14pc. But if the results of the poll were matched in a general election scenario, the party would pick up additional seats right across the country."
" . . but we do not want to leave the EU. Leaving the EU and the Eurozone is also not a goal in the FPÖ's party programme. Instead, he said, there was a call for a fundamental reform of the Union."
" 13 is scheduled for the laying of wreaths in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. PiS for the time being does not specify when and where the meeting between Salvini and Kaczynski will take place, with whom - as PiS politicians suggest - the Northern League leader will talk about &bdquo;EU problems and immigration, but mainly about creating a new Eurosceptic faction in the European Parliament after the elections in May. When Matteo Salvini was elected head of the Northern League in 2013, the party, mired in financial scandals, had disastrous ratings of 3-4 percent, although it had previously won up to one in ten votes in elections."
" 2007- 2013) and had regularly attracted unpleasant attention with dissenting opinions. For example, she voted with the FPÖ against the EU fiscal pact. In the end, both the SPÖ and Ablinger drew their lessons from the Prammer succession mess."

" 22-year-old Krista Bjerknæs Fallesen joined DF when she was 18. Her father is an academic, her mother is a nurse - and her sympathy for the DF does not come from home, she explains about her views. DANSK FOLKEPARTI They are friends, about to take academic degrees and agree that it is in the Danish People's Party that they will find politicians who want something with life, Denmark and all of us.I am very EU skeptical, and when I read the DF's party program, I sat and nodded all the way through, and then I joined. I like to take a stand."
" 23% of respondents would like to do as Britain did - first negotiate new membership terms and then hold a referendum. The majority of the Finns want an EU referendum (Yle 12.7.). President Timo Soini has promised that the issue will be considered when the electoral programme for the next parliamentary elections starts to be planned in late 2018.For the Finns, it may be a last-minute attempt to boost their sagging support, but it also plays itself out of the next government."
" 25 million, but they impose a very high 12% rate of return. The price of risk, which the public authorities are obliged to follow, on pain of having their loans requalified as state aid by the EU. This led to a tug-of-war between the Rassemblement National, which found the rate scandalous, and Xavier Bertrand during the plenary session of the regional council. ""Banco, find a bank,"" thundered the regional president."
" 25 of the 27 member states reached an agreement in June, but the European Parliament and the Commission opposed it in a defence of the European Court of Justice against a new special court. The compromise was that patent cases are complicated and require a special court, but with the EU Court of Justice as the highest instance in patent disputes within the EU.The Danish agreement is that the Danish People's Party and the Green Party have demanded a referendum.. As a matter of principle, we believe that when something is a transfer of sovereignty, the people must be consulted, says Morten Messerschmidt, EU parliamentarian for the Danish People's Party (DF), to Ritzau."
" 48 percent do not want that. The AfD also criticises not too much influence, but the organisation of the EU. Meuthen: The EU is organised far too centrally. The ordinary citizen has almost no possibility to meaningfully influence decisions in Brussels. Incidentally, this criticism is also shared by Europe supporters."
" 480 MEPs voted yes, almost unanimously those from the EPP, S&D, Liberals, 159 said no, especially those from the Left Group, the Greens and the EU-sceptics and Right. The Austrian MEPs all voted in favour of the amendment, including the three Greens. The four FPÖ MEPs abstained.The core of the new regulation, which was advocated by Austria among 19 (smaller) of a total of 28 member states, is that the nation states now have the vested Community right to ban such GMO products on their territory (or only parts of it), even if they have received EU-wide approval by the EU Commission in accordance with the internal market rules."
 5. The last paragraph of Wolfgang Böhm's editorial unmasks the basic attitude of the press very clearly: The FPÖ [. . .] wants to throw as much sand as possible into the EU's gears. Those who choose them should be aware of this.
 50Plus sees the solution in lowering the retirement age to 65. Forum voor Democratie and VoorNederland advocate leaving the European Union. The PVV wants all borders to close. Also the parties differ sharply on the issue of eliminating the growing uncertainty in the labor market.
" 7, not counting the rule of law procedure and several complaints by the Commission to the CJEU for violation of the Treaties. Even if, subjectively, PiS does not want to take Poland out of the EU, its actions certainly have the effect of placing Poland on the distant periphery of the EU. A reflection of this marginalization of Poland in Europe is PiS's self-isolation in the EU institutions: a party ruling a large country belongs to a niche political family of Europhobes, pro-Putin activists, pro-Brexit, populists, and ordinary political freaks. Locked in its cocoon of suspicion and resentment, PiS does not have the instruments to forge coalitions of interests useful to Poland."
 7. The FPÖ is once again living up to its reputation. That Mr Vilimsky is a dyed-in-the-wool EU opponent who seizes every opportunity to blast it is unfortunately obvious. The fact that he is thus at odds with the government programme only shows that this party has basically not changed.
" 8 Austria. Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) wants to lobby at EU level that in future there will be no possibility to apply for asylum on European soil. Refugees should only have the opportunity to do so outside Europe in transit zones, he explained yesterday in Innsbruck.S."

 90 - by a two-thirds majority (where Poland waives its rights in favour of an international organisation). PiS has been demanding since last year's vote on Croatia's accession to the EU that virtually all decisions concerning the Union be made under Article. 90 This would allow Jaroslaw Kaczynski's party to block any.
" @JV Extension. Even on the subject of EU enlargement, the FPÖ has to jump over its shadow. The new government is committed to the admission of the Western Balkan countries to the EU."
" A Brexit can have a negative trust effect that extends far beyond the UK's borders - giving an international recession or European disintegration just that final push. 3Will there ever be a Nexit? In the Netherlands, only the PVV and the Bontes/Van Klaveren group believe that the Netherlands should leave the European Union. That is nowhere near a parliamentary majority."
" A British exit from the EU will raise existential questions in Denmark that cannot be answered for many years to come. If the British vote to leave the EU, the leader of the Danish People's Party, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, will demand a future Danish referendum on Danish membership. The polls show that he will not have the support of either Christiansborg or the population for this."
" A European balancing act for the FPÖ Analysis. The general EU commitment is not a big challenge for the Freedom Party, the promised Ceta ratification and a constructive line in all EU institutions more so.Vienna."
" A Sebastian Kurz, for example, would do black-blue, but blue-black with him as vice-chancellor would certainly not. This is the core question of the Republic: New coalitions have long been possible, and now even more so, almost only with the inclusion of the extremely right-wing populist, xenophobic, anti-EU, Putin-affiliated, authoritarian-minded FPÖ (currently 30% in the polls).It is almost impossible to get around the FPÖ if you want something other than red-black. This is the crux or the curse or simply the irony of the Second Republic at the latest since 1970 (!), when Bruno Kreisky could only begin his unprecedented triumphal march by tolerating his minority government by the then small FPÖ."
" A Turkey that turns its back on Europe is not. Certainly not if the Netherlands unnecessarily provokes the Turkish view of Asia with additional demands that are not in line with those of the EU.This is why it is damaging that the PVV's support partner wanted to declare the Turkish president persona non grata. And, when that failed, responded to Gül's concerns about the religious we/they vote with a text that further undermines the national interests of the Netherlands: Turkish humor: Christian-bully, Kurdish-bashing, Hamas-friend and Islamist Gul complains about intolerance, as Wilders tweeted Saturday."
 A balanced national budget over the economic cycle will probably not be a priority for all comrades. One looks in vain for a commitment to the EU in the FPÖ programme; there is only talk of a Europe of historically grown peoples. For this you will not find the passage We strive for the unity of Tyrol in the SPÖ programme.
" A ballot traditionally used as an outlet for voters. How will the National Front in France, Ukip in the UK, Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement in Italy and Golden Dawn in Greece fare? The disaffection of Europeans with Europe has never been so strong, it is obvious. The south of the eurozone is in a deep recession from which it cannot escape."
" A bravado in the face of the great crisis that the executive and the head of state were going through at the time. A few months later, Marine Le Pen finally found her reply, on Sunday 13 January, at the Mutualité, in Paris, during the launch of the National Rally campaign for the European electionsAlmost a year and a half after the presidential election and her crushing defeat, the president of the Rassemblement National believes she has her revenge."
" A breakup between them is highly unlikely, for now, despite latent friction. There remains the enemy of Europe, which seems inclined to use Italy as a scapegoat for its own difficulties: as a populist discolus to be punished in order to educate others, scattered in the bellies of other EU nations. Unfortunately, however, M5S and Lega also need a scapegoat, and Brussels lends itself perfectly with its attacks on xenophobic and populist Italy.It's a zero-sum game, in which everyone participates with an exaggerated charge of aggression, and with the illusion of coming out stronger."
" A commitment to Europe was out of the question, and a clear pro-European line would be reflected in the government programme, it was explained to the press. However, Kurz and FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache want to work together for reforms in Brussels. An EU convention is to work out the Austrian position in this debate. One possibility would be subsidiarity checks in the parliamentary procedure."
" A communication from the Committee on Demographic Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences shows that we take the first place in Europe when it comes to excess deaths. In this matter - the most important one, because of the life of the citizens of the Republic - the PiS state simply fails, it fails.Finally, war with the EU, and in the long run, Poland's exit from the EU.I don't think anyone doubts that, it's a matter of Polish raison d'etre."
" A day after Austrian presidential candidate Norbert Hofer (FPÖ) met with Czech President Milogsh Zeman in Prague, the head of the Czech government spoke out: Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka criticised Hofer's proposal to form a union within the Union. The day before, Hofer and Zeman had spoken out in favour of close cooperation between Austria and the Visegrád states (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia)."
" A diplomatic rejection front formed in Europe's government centres under the leadership of the French president. Jacques Chirac was the harshest critic of Black-Blue, not so much out of concern for Vienna's EU policy, but because of the Haider-FPÖ's trivialisation of National Socialism. In France at the time, Jean-Marie Le Pen (Marine's father) and his Front National, which Chirac fought hard, were soaring."
" A doer. He also joined the AfD because he did not like the financial policy within the EU, as he says today. He had been concerned with less bureaucracy, more economy and transparency, also within his own party."
" A draft resolution has been submitted to the Senate calling on the government to back down from its threats to veto the EU budget. A draft resolution has been submitted to the Senate calling on the government to withdraw its threats to veto the EU budget. - The veto, which the PiS government has announced it will use, harms Poland's economic, political and strategic interests. It threatens to delay, limit or even halt the disbursement of hundreds of billions of European funds to Poland, including the Housing and Resilience Facility, to help overcome the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic."
" A draft resolution has been submitted to the Senate calling on the government to back off its threats to veto the EU budget.

" A few days ago, a Brussels daily aptly wrote: &bdquo;The fury of the government in Warsaw after its failure to block Tusk has turned to the EU. PiS is becoming an anti-European formation comparable to Le Pen's party and Britain's radical Brexit supporters.The lion's share of the PiS electorate are people who, in the 2003 accession referendum"
" A few months later, Marine Le Pen finally found her reply, on Sunday 13 January, at the Mutualité, in Paris, during the launch of the National Rally campaign for the European elections In the wake of the presidential election and her crushing defeat, the president of the Rassemblement National believes she has her revenge. According to her, it will take place on Sunday 26 May 2019, the day of the European elections. A victory that will erase, for good, the bad memories of the debate between the two parties and the year that followed."
" A forward-looking critique of the EU is needed to help pave the way for a better community for future generations of Europeans. In Denmark, a party like Enhedslisten should play in the debate in favour of a stronger community in the EU and not just leave the EU criticism to DF. It is therefore sad that the Greens are sitting on the sidelines with their arms crossed."
" A free hotline has even been set up at the Ministry of the Interior. Both referendums were initiated by Robert Marschall, the leader of the EU Exit Party. And both referendums support old core demands of the FPÖ, which were apparently no longer so important when the FPÖ became part of the government. On Ceta, the FPÖ bowed to the will of its coalition partner."
" A fundamental change in the mandate of a mission also requires an Article 100 letter. Should the PVV's aversion to the European Union still prevail, support from opposition parties is essential. MP Ewout Irrgang (SP) says he is very reluctant."
" A greater component of insecurity in the age of terror is hardly conceivable. At the same time, Austria is being forced into a state of explanation in the EU-Russia crisis thanks to the FPÖ's friendship treaty with Vladimir Putin's United Russia party. This, too, will not strengthen the will of other states to cooperate."
" A look at the voting behaviour of ÖVP and FPÖ MEPs on concrete EU decisions in the European Parliament shows that the differences are far greater than the Federal Chancellor admits. In the March plenary session of the EU Parliament alone, there was not a single agreement between the ÖVP and the FPÖ in the vote on important EU decisions ranging from regional funding to Brexit to the uniform corporate tax base. In many votes, the FPÖ MEPs vote against reforms of the EU or abstain when it comes to problem solving and even more efficiency in those issues that should actually be close to their hearts, such as uniform identity papers for rejected asylum seekers or an expansion of external border protection."
" A mosquito becomes an elephant Die Presse: After the criticism of Andreas Mölzer because of his statements about a Negro conglomerate in the EU and a comparison with the Nazi regime: As the runner-up for the EU election, are you now the serious face of the FPÖ?Harald Vilimsky: No, I allow myself to be one of them, just as everyone else is."
" A pamphlet, Austerity isn t working, was also launched by the party. Speaking at the National Gallery, Mr Adams argued that if Ireland ratified the treaty, it would mean the handover of powers to unelected officials and bureaucrats in the EU Commission .He said that providing a stimulus to create jobs was at the heart of Sinn Féin s approach. You cannot cut your way out of recession . . . There is no jobs stimulus in the Government s strategy."
" A person close to the MEP commented: ""When Orbán sees that LR has a 12% share and that we are the dominant party, he will quickly change his mind. But if LR is struggling in France, the EPP (European Right), to which Orbán still belongs, should remain in the majority. The meeting on Saturday will mainly aim to ""show the dynamics"", says another RN executive: ""Do you know many parties in the European elections that organise such a big meeting?"" ""The idea is to form a large bloc and force the other [far-right parties] to join us,"" said Nicolas Bay, the outgoing co-president of ENL, who plans to run again in the event of a group dominated by the French and Italians. ""After 2014, it took us a year to form our group."
" A poll for Altinget showed that 46 percent of Danes want to renegotiate the country's EU membership to take back power from the EU - only 33 percent said no. It is uncertain whether voters have considered the consequences if more EU member states join the renegotiation queue, which would weaken the EU's capacity to act. The DF has linked EU citizens' access to welfare benefits with the demand for renegotiation.-- The party has also called for border controls to be reintroduced, even though this is contrary to the EU's single market and Schengen."
" A prominent signatory of the motion had been Jörg Haider himself. There were also some politicians in the FPÖ who, like Erwin Hirnschall, now still advocated EU membership. When Haider accused Chancellor Vranitzky in an ORF discussion shortly before the vote of acting on behalf of the Bilderbergers and Freemasons, he overstretched the debate."
" A referendum on this issue, if held today, would be a defeat for the nationalist government. But PiS leaders always say they have no intention of leaving the EU. Jacques Rupnik adds, Britain and Poland did not join the EU for the same reasons."
" A renewed candidacy of Hans-Peter Martin (whose list HPM made 17.7 per cent and three mandates in 2009, later crumbled) is uncertain. A gain to the current two EU mandates seems easy, as the FPÖ only achieved 12.7 per cent in 2009. Mölzer: Of course we have to be careful with slogans like ""Out of the EU! . It is not necessary to be hysterical. Whether this line will prevail, we will see."
" A report by the British agency Reuters showed a picture in which the Eurosceptic and far-right bloc could grow by up to 60% in the European Parliament elections. Formations such as those of Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen are two of its greatest exponents. In Spain, there is the emergence of Vox. Europe is built by all of us, day by day."
" A resurrection coupled with a coronation: that of Marine Le Pen, who succeeded her father three years earlier and saw her leadership validated on a personal and political level. Advised by the very Europhobic Florian Philippot (who is now flying on his own wings with his meagre Patriotes), the new leader of the Front considers validated the priority given in her programme to the exit from the euro and the EU. What followed was more mixed: defections within the FN group, which lost a third of its members during the mandate; legal problems, as the party was suspected of having organised a vast system of fictitious employment in Strasbourg; and a strategic impasse, as the movement's Europhobic discourse proved to be a handicap rather than a springboard to power. To the extent that the movement has, since the last presidential election, largely renounced it."
" A roll call and digital vote in the House should ensure that cartel members can be held individually accountable for their voting behavior . And, as in the United States, top civil servants must reapply when a new cabinet takes office. Loose from administrative renewal, the FvD advocates quitting the euro and open borders and then leaving the European Union. This must be decided by referendum."
" A rolling of heads is rather out of the question, as was the case at the crisis meeting on Sunday. Rather, the FPÖ wants to position itself more edgily with regard to the National Council elections and the associated dealings with Frank Stronach - with the topics of asylum abuse, EU criticism and social policy. However, a personnel (preliminary) decision could still be made. The FPÖ is once again entitled to a People's Advocate. The lawyer and member of the National Council, Peter Fichtenbauer, is considered the favourite for this post."
" A sceptic is walking through Europe The June European elections are predicted to lead to a significant increase in support for Eurosceptic parties. These are the more 'hardline' type - in Britain the UK Independence Party (UKIP), in Germany the Alternative for Germany and here in Denmark the Danish People's Party.Support for the EU, and especially the way it works, is declining. More voters want to leave the Union altogether."
" A solution that allows both the League and the Movement to extricate themselves from a political maelstrom that is difficult to unravel. Meanwhile, on the subject of corrections to the maneuver rages the toto-cifre, given the still uncertain scenarios: there are those who assume an outstretched hand to the EU with a rescue by putting his hand to the Treasury, but sources of both the Five Stars and the League ensure that the corrections should amount to 3.5 billion (2.6 from the start delayed reforms on citizenship income and quota 100). The spectre that agitates the executive are the very tight timescales and the idea of having to face a third passage through the House before the end of the month."
" A statement opposing the treaty signed by Sinn Féin, Independent and Socialist TDs and a number of trade unionists and academics was presented at the event. Director of the Sinn Féin campaign Eoin Ó Broin said: If the Government requires emergency funding in 2014 the EU will provide that funding. After the referendum the Government would have a veto over the final form of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) because all 27 member states would have to ratify a change to the European treaties."
" A strong campaign could mobilise usual non-voters - many now disillusioned liberals - for staying in. The earlier Northern Ireland general election survey suggests Catholics are three times more in favour of the EU than Protestants, with 27 per cent of Sinn Féin voters and 52.4 per cent of DUP ones for leaving the EU. The recent joint BBC/RTÉ polling had 55 per cent in the North and 71 per cent in the Republic in favour of remaining in."
" A struggle that is not only against the regime, as the government Now it is quite politically legitimate to stand up for understanding with Russia and to mobilise against the EU sanctions. After all, not only the AfD, but also the CSU, politicians from the SPD and Christian Lindner are now speaking out. Of course, the conference did not spend a second discussing concrete strategies on how to bring down the sanctions."
" A symbolic return to the People's Republic of Poland [COMMENTS] Judgment The decision of the Constitutional Court is commented by politicians and journalists. Many commentators point out that the verdict can be seen as the first step towards Polexit, they also highlight the role of Stanislaw Piotrowicz, a former Law and Justice MP who served as a prosecutor during the communist era. Pseudo-TK against Poland in the EU. Piotrowicz's paws."
" A total of 922,279 firearms of all categories were registered at the end of the year. Harald Vilimsky (FPÖ), a staunchly pro-gun MEP, wants to prevent liability premiums from having to be paid for them in the future. He also sits on the committee concerned."
" A united and strong Europe is desired neither by the USA, nor by China, nor by Russia, yet Europe's right-wing populists (FPÖ, Lega Nord, AfD, etc.) are doing their utmost to hinder further unification. The Austrian electorate is also falling for the dangerous nonsense about the evil EU - which the FPÖ also likes to spread.Brussels will have to get more competences and Europe will be united - or not."
" ARTICLE Then the EU lights go out I'd put my money on Hofer of the FPÖ winning this election, said Nigel Farage in December 2016. One of the driving forces behind Britain's exit from the EU was certain that the Austrian presidential election would go in favour of a candidate who advocated a reclaiming of national sovereignty."
" Abject submission to they-whomust-be-obeyed is the bottom line for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and Labour. Sinn Féin and its allies have also nailed their colours to the EU mast since Brexit. When push comes to shove they will also wring their hands and say: 'Sure we gave it a good go, but what can we do? The EU have spoken.' The choice for Ireland is simple - if people are happy to be ruled by European civil servants they didn't elect, fair enough."
" According to Annemans, it was agreed that the parties would support each other in the campaign. In the previous European elections, parties were particularly successful with a clear narrative: the PVV triumphed with a fierce anti-Brussels campaign, D66 with: 'Europe: Yes!' The middle parties, who tried with 'yes, provided', suffered defeat. According to their slogans, formerly Eurosceptic parties like SP and ChristenUnie are now also struggling with this dilemma."
" According to Frantescu, the composition of the parliament is more relevant than ever when viewed this way. Euroscepticism On the other hand, how much will Eurosceptic parties actually get done soon? Whether the recent attempts by PVV leader Geert Wilders to combine the forces of such parties, such as the British UKIP and the French Front National, on a European level has a chance of succeeding is uncertain. UKIP rejects cooperation, the Front National seems more open to cooperation."
" According to Le Figaro, Rutte's possible ignoring of the result could lead to additional criticism from Eurosceptics on the democratic deficit of European decision-making. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, like many other international media, quoted PVV leader Geert Wilders calling the result on Twitter the beginning of the end of the EU. The German news agency DPA called the result extra wry for the Netherlands, as the country currently holds the presidency of the European Union."
" According to Martin Henriksen, the Danish People's Party's spokesperson on integration, increased controls at Danish borders and at Copenhagen Airport are the most effective tools to combat human trafficking. DF wants to tighten border controls, SF wants to increase EU cooperation, while S has no further measures ready against human trafficking. The police must of course continue to focus on investigative work."
" According to Othmar Karas, head of the ÖVP delegation, a blue veto would be a breach of constitutional conformity in Austria, which is the basis of government policy in the EU. The validity of the Minsk Agreement has legal status. Karas, like the EU mandataries from the SPÖ, the Greens and the Liberals, sees an urgent need for action by the FPÖ regarding its membership in the group founded by Le Pen with FPÖ Secretary General Harald Vilimsky under the name Europe of Nations and Freedom : ""To lead the Austrian EU Presidency in 2018 and to be a member there at the same time is a contradiction, it does not strengthen Austria. No compulsion"
" According to Sipilä, there will be no EU referendum in Finland, at least not during this government, because there is no such referendum in the government programme. Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini, chairman of the Finns, has commented on the calls for a more ambiguous EU referendum in Finland. Soini said this week that the Finns' final position on the referendum will be known in late 2018 or early 2019."
" According to Turunen, however, the government has not agreed on the amount of the withholding tax. .Perus Finns can also point the finger of blame at the EU, nothing good came out of it this time either.0"
" According to an analysis by the Allensbach Institute for Public Opinion Research, the alternative stands above all for limiting immigration, stricter asylum laws and the abolition of the euro. According to the survey, every second person sees the AfD as an advocate of national interests vis-à-vis the EU.We will focus on about eight issues, says AfD deputy leader Konrad Adam."
" According to an official FPÖ press statement on the Austria Presse Agentur site, Wilders stated after his meeting with Strache that his party has more in common with the FPÖ than with the rest of the Dutch parliament and that he looks at Austria and the FPÖ with admiration. Wilders and Strache decided on an anti-EU alliance in Vienna, for which the PVV front man had previously warmed to Marine Le Pen's Front National and Filip Dewinter's Vlaams Belang. So an alliance of Holocaust deniers and anti-Semites."
" According to analysts, The Brexit victoryhas strengthened the anti-Europeanism of Italy's populist parties, M5S and Lega.0"
" According to calculations by the Linz-based Market Institute, with 30 per cent of the vote it would be about three percentage points better off than five years ago. The SPÖ and the FPÖ are also likely to make gains, with 25 and 21 per cent respectively in the EU Sunday poll, about one percentage point above the last election result.The Neos (last 8.1 per cent) could also gain strongly to 11 per cent, the Greens would perform significantly worse than last (14.5 per cent) with eight per cent."
" According to environmental organizations and predominantly left-wing parties, the trade treaty is only good for big business and bad for the climate and animal welfare. PVV and FvD don't want the EU to make trade agreements at all. SP, 50Plus, GroenLinks, PvdA, PvdD, SGP and Denk also oppose the treaty."
" According to him, it could take years. PVV leader Wilders reacts angrily. Rutte capitulates together with Merkel and the rest of the EU elite to the Islamofascist Erdogan, he says of the Turkish president. Wilders denounces the billions, visa-free travel for Turks to the EU and talks for EU membership."
" According to its own information, the agency currently has 600 permanent employees. But Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) has no intention of complying with the EU's insistence. Austria will maintain its border controls until there is external border protection not only on paper but also in practice, he said at the beginning of the conference of European interior ministers and those of the Western Balkan states in Vienna's Austria Center."
" According to my British colleague, she is worried about the danger of what Podemos might achieve in Spain, the Eurosceptics in Italy or the National Front in France, if Syriza gets its way. He wonders if Podemos can be defeated by crushing Tsipras, or can it discourage Le Pen by violating the sovereignty and sensibility of a nation.. If you believe that the loyalty of young Europeans is going to change by making the left a martyr."
" According to party leader Heinz-Christian Strache, closer cooperation with the Visggarad group of Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia would be desirable. However, the party has abandoned a referendum on leaving the EU after the Brexit chaos. The FPÖ pleads for the northern euro and an end to the Russia sanctions.The Greens see climate change as the most important challenge of the Austrian Council Presidency."
" According to the AfD board member, this is only to blame emotional sensitivities for what is happening in Germany. This is a strategy of the political opponent - so that one does not have to talk about the fact that today the worst policies since the Second World War are being made in Germany and Brussels, from the supreme nonsense of the energy transition to monetary union and the centralised EU. Merkel's refugee policy would have to be added. Fighting this, says Glaser, does not occur to the AfD out of diffuse resentment, but results from strictly rational analysis. With this, Glaser makes it clear on the one hand that interpretive mental analysis will get you nowhere with the AfD. So one forgets the thesis that behind the programme there is something else, something that can be psychologised."
" According to the EU Treaty, only one representative per country can participate. Hofer, however, apparently believes that he could force his own EU course as president. In contrast to Van der Bellen, that would be a sharp anti-EU course.An election on the EU course FPÖ presidential candidate Norbert Hofer has made an interesting announcement on Austria's course as a member of the EU."

" According to the survey, the ÖVP has recently been able to mobilise its core voters particularly well. With the voters of the FPÖ and the Team Stronach, which, however, is not contesting the EU elections, the intention to vote is lower than with other parties. The FPÖ in particular is finding it difficult to mobilise EU opponents to go to an election in which they are hardly interested."
" According to the ÖVP politician, the combination of incompetent bank management and incompetent FPÖ policies caused and made possible the Hypo debacle. The cover-up tactics of the FPÖ and BZÖ are exposed by the report of the EU Commission. The FPÖ and the BZÖ are not going to take this lying down."
" According to this club, the future belongs to open platforms in which people themselves determine who to trust, what to find, what to do. Together with website GeenStijl and Burgercomité-EU, Forum voor Democratie is the initiator of next Wednesday's referendum. 'That the EU means peace is nonsense."
" Accordingly, it is not presented and discussed in the Bundestag. It is a criticism that the FDP, which also has a critical eye on the EU, does not want to let stand. Unfortunately, the AfD is willing to use any means to badmouth the EU in general - as shown by the claim that federal payments are not reflected in the budget, says Otto Fricke, the budgetary spokesman for the Liberals. One should first read the budget before making such an assertion. The fact that so little can be changed in section 6001 because it is fixed in this way also occurs in other budget items, for example in the benefit laws for social services."
" Accordingly, people want more Europe on the big issues, less on the small ones. But basically both sides are committed to the EU. Heinz-Christian Strache, a member of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), has repeatedly stated that leaving the EU is not (or no longer) an issue for the FPÖ.The most sensitive point remains direct democracy, which has not yet been discussed in the steering group - and which is being saved for last for good reason."
" Achleitner also talks about the possibility of a foundation solution. Manfred Haimbuchner (FPÖ), Vice-President of the Provincial Government, meanwhile, complains of anti-industry policies at both federal and EU level.For the region itself, the comparison with Steyr suggests itself."
" Actually, both addressees are really kept on the joke. Because in between, with an unmistakable wink, the FPÖ is always telling its own clientele that in truth it is staying on an anti-EU course anyway. While the FPÖ was more of a buddy of Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders before joining the federal government, it is now the driving force in the camp of European right-wing populists with the right-wing Italian bully politician Matteo Salvini and with Orbán.--You can already tell from the body language how closely connected H.-C."
" Adding others, especially the Left, is more problematic, easier for the PSL I think. PiS is at war with the EU. Could the new Euroscepticism, or Poles' disappointment that the EU is not helping us in the fight for the rule of law, be growing?"
" AfD party conference: EU exit demanded Dresden - Lousy election results, meagre polls, leadership dispute: difficult times for the AfD.Nearly 600 delegates of the far-right party met in Dresden yesterday despite the third Corona wave."
" AfD positions itself for the European elections Thesis paper encourages internal party debate on the EU, immigration and coalitions In the beginning, it had hardly any other topic than the euro, and from this the European topic derived inevitably. Even though the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has now clearly positioned itself in many policy areas and has internally fought sometimes fierce disputes with opponents of Islam, criticism of the euro bailout policy has remained its central motive."
" AfD rejects tightening of gun laws Sale of guns to Paris under consideration AfD European politician Marcus Pretzell has massively criticised the EU Commission's measures to tighten gun laws across Europe. It is difficult to understand why the gun laws should be tightened, Pretzell tells Die Welt."

" After Martin Graf, Heinz-Christian Strache has removed Andreas Mölzer, another weighty exponent of the Burschenschafter camp. The FPÖ is facing a test of strength, which for the time being could translate into a mobilisation problem for the EU elections. What the national camp can achieve was shown in 2004 during Mölzer's preferential voting campaign."
" After Mölzer's comparison of the EU with the Nazi regime and his negro-conglomerate slogans, Strache still backed his designated EU top candidate - but he could no longer accept the denigration of football idol David Alaba (pitch black) in Zur Zeit from two years ago that became known afterwards. The distance that other European right-wing populist parties were distancing themselves from the FPÖ did the rest. The EU alliance from the Front National to the Sweden Democrats was in danger. An alliance that - irony aside - Andreas Mölzer had engineered."
" After a long period of deliberation during the summer break, the MEP let AfD members know by circular on Wednesday that he would not seek candidacy for the Bundestag elections, but wanted to stay in Brussels and Strasbourg. There he could fulfil an important task for the AfD in the resistance against EU centralisation. This threatens to turn Berlin, like other national capitals, more and more into a kind of branch office and recipient of orders from Brussels, Meuthen wrote."
" After a long time of using anti-EU rhetoric, it seems that the time has come to change the discourse. - Professor Jadwiga Staniszkis, who has been critical of Kaczynski's party for some time, commented. We are dealing with some gigantic, monstrous lie that PiS wants to take Poland out of the EU, - Professor Ryszard Legutko, who not long ago praised Prime Minister Beata Szydlo for removing European Union flags, is outraged. She was already preparing to scare people that PiS wants to take Poland out of the European Union, and suddenly Jaroslaw Kaczynski came out and said that neither the party he leads nor the Polish government is going anywhere, and all those who talk about Poland leaving the EU are harming our country, a right-wing blogger rejoices at Kaczynski's successful trick."
" After a year of unsuccessful pressure on the Polish government, the Commission decided this week to refer the matter to the Council of Ministers. On the other hand, the Danish People's Party says: The EU should not think that it can correct the member states about their internal affairs.This shows that the EU sees itself as an empire, which outclasses the member states that do not behave, as the centre of the empire in Brussels expects. It is a completely wrong course that can only create resistance and division in Europe, says party rapporteur Kenneth Kristensen Berth."
" After all, Hofer insinuated that Van der Bellen had been an Eastern spy. And not bad, too, the FPÖ parliamentary question on how Austria intends to defend itself militarily in the event of an EU attack! Van der Bellen recited it with relish.Hofer is almost allowed to flip out; and Van der Bellen also bursts his collar from time to time."
" After all, trade agreements are the exclusive competence of the EU, not of the member states. The Netherlands could demand a adjustment in the political part of the treaty, for example, the explicit assurance that the treaty does not lead to Ukrainian membership of the EU. For GeenPeil, with the Forum for Democracy and the EU Citizens' Committee initiator of the referendum, the typical Brussels solution proves precisely what they were up against: against the lack of democracy. The Ukrainian ambassador to the Netherlands did not want to comment last night."
" After his election victory in October, he was in Brussels and assured everyone, from Juncker to Merkel to Macron, and officials of the European People's Party, that the ÖVP would be and remain an EU party and that he was not thinking of joining the club of Eastern European authoritarians, the Visegrád states. With regard to the planned coalition with the FPÖ, the leader of the EPP group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, said: Any cranks from radicals would have no place in the future government in Vienna, nor would ideas of leaving the EU (Öxit) or the Eurozone. Wishful thinking."

Wishful thinking. Since then, the FPÖ has repeatedly given clear anti-European signals: The Öxit must of course be included as a possibility via easier referendums. The EU's Russia sanctions must go, said Johann Gudenus, the leading Putin admirer in a guard of Russia fans within the FPÖ."
" After its failure in the Bundestag elections, the FDP is also threatened with a weak performance in Europe. The competition from the Euro-critical AfD is constant at 6 percent. However, the FDP would be represented in the EU Parliament. The three-percent hurdle had been removed by the Constitutional Court."
" After joining the EU and NATO, the alliance of Central and Eastern European states only gained weight and influence in the refugee crisis through their concerted resistance to the welcoming culture. This became apparent in June when the EU Commission and its new head were appointed. Gone, of course, are the days when the FPÖ pushed headlong for membership in Visegrád and urged its unwilling coalition partner, the ÖVP, to do so. Visegrád plus, the pet project of Czech President Milogsh Zeman, is passé."
" After that, Austria may hold the presidency twice more: In the first half of 2006, the Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected by the Netherlands and France, must be put back on track; in the second half of 2018, accents will be set in environmental policy with a ban on disposable plastic. At the end of January 2000, the 14 EU partners decide to isolate Wolfgang Schüssel's cabinet in view of the FPÖ's participation in the government. This stylises the measures as"
" After the 2011 elections, the Social Democrats had to adopt the bourgeois economic policies they had criticised before the elections. For the Danish People's Party and the Left, there are a number of points of contention in EU policy. The Danish People's Party wants to reintroduce border barriers and have Danes vote on the package that Britain is working to negotiate for itself."
" After the UK's decision to leave, Hofer can back the EU sceptics, especially in a clash with Alexander Van der Bellen, who is a clear EU supporter. It will be exciting to see whether Hofer will call for an Öxit - the FPÖ, for all its scepticism about the EU, has so far not wanted to go that far.As a consequence of the decision of the Constitutional Court, the FPÖ is also calling for a reform of electoral law, especially postal voting."
" After the country indicated that it needed 100 billion euros to help its banks, interest rates on Spanish government bonds rose to record levels in the markets. Despite their criticism, CDA, PvdA, D66 and GroenLinks agree with the agreements in Brussels. This is not the case for SP and PVV. ,,Soon we will all be paying for failed banks, without the banking sector having been addressed first by the government of that bank's country."
" After the election, everything is open. ÖVP Secretary General Werner Amon, however, can hardly imagine a coalition with the EU-critical FPÖ. And you?"
" After the euro fiasco, the FN is already thinking about alternative European treaties. To make people forget the debate between the two rounds in which the candidate stumbled, undermining her credibility, her ability to govern and to lead a possible exit from the euro."
" Against the EU and against the exit study. The FPÖ is attempting a balancing act with its criticism of Europe: on the one hand it is raging against Brussels, but on the other hand it does not want to offend those voters who are afraid of a break with Europe.Vienna."
" Against the law of the strongest, the strength of the law must prevail. 6. Against one-sided EU criticism. Although the EU issue has now moved into the background, the AfD still criticises European integration, especially the euro. In fact, the euro is much more stable today than the D-mark was in long periods, such as the 1970s and the early 1980s."
" Against this background, many doubters will probably be inclined to vote no just in case. Japanese parties' biggest mistake is letting the anti-EU set the agenda. The supporters are scared to death of the DF and the voters and have themselves helped to create an image in the population that the EU is of evil. That is why we must only cooperate where absolutely necessary and otherwise maintain our reservations."
" Against this background, the Platform will present itself as a party whose further rule will mean stability and security understood not only in the military context, but also in the economic one. Interestingly, the survey shows that Poles are less afraid of PiS's anti-Europeanism because they believe Poland is so entrenched in the EU that even governments of populists reluctant to the EU will not turn it back. This is difficult for the Platform, which has so far exploited PiS's Euroscepticism in its campaigns."
" Agree to insist on barges. Immigrants and crime were fuel for success in 2014. But everything else, where is it? The productive fabric of the North is suffering, the League does not ride it enough. The leader now dreams of Brexit, just as he had bet on the Austrian overturn or the Catalan referendum. It cultivates populist alliances on a global scale."
" Alexander Van der Bellen has won the Federal Presidential run-off election and increased his lead over Norbert Hofer tenfold. To analyse this result, it is useful to look not only at the electoral motives surveyed by Sora on behalf of the ORF: In favour of Van der Bellen, besides Austria's reputation abroad, a positive attitude towards the EU and the understanding of office, above all the rejection of the FPÖ candidate; motives that tipped the scales in favour of Hofer were an understanding of people's concerns, criticism of Austria's political system and a negative attitude towards the EU.However, one should also take a closer look at the data on group-specific voting behaviour and the changes in the election year 2016, especially with regard to the view of central problems and moods in the electorate."
" All it takes is the catch of one undersized clam and fishermen are likely to jump. In support of Fabbri came also Salvini, who added to the dose and invited the fishermen to revolt against the inflexible constraints of the EU. The EU, always the EU. Our coast, from fishing to beach concessions, is threatened by a Europe that wants to massacre our companies and our economy, Fabbri added. Fishing a single undersized shellfish, that is, less than the 2.5 centimeters established by law, leads straight to a criminal trial, with penalties of up to 4 thousand euros, with no tolerance."
" All parties to the agreement have the right of veto if Denmark is to adhere to the immigration policy. DF says that the Folketing should decide everything, not the EU. But in this case the Folketing is against the DF, so now the Folketing should not decide anyway."
" All that matters to him is what he gets in his hand: 500+, thirteen, fourteen. Since its accession to the EU, Poland has been its biggest beneficiary. Every year we pay about EUR 3 billion and receive EUR 10. And PiS? He quarreled with the EU and blocked 57 billion euros of subsidies from the Reconstruction Fund. On top of that, Poland is paying one million euros a day for not implementing the CJEU ruling."
" All this can - hopefully! - the ÖVP does not want. Add to this the FPÖ's repeated game of leaving the EU. Not at the moment, of course, because Hofer needs an absolute majority, and he won't get it that way."
" All with ample opportunity to shop in the designer boutiques of Via Nassa. It turned out that public opinion has rewarded the League, which has made the war on openness to the EU and the limitation of the entry of foreign labor its workhorse. Not secessionists, like Bossi's League, but arch-Swiss, to be clear."
" All with clear appeals to the two key parties that could trigger a referendum. It is as if it is difficult to understand that we still live in a globalised world, says Christian Ingemann, director of the Confederation of Danish Enterprise, referring to the opposition of the Danish parliament and the opposition of the Greens to the patent court.The new patent system in the EU is a major diplomatic victory for the outgoing Danish EU Presidency, where Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt ( S) invested considerable effort in convincing British Prime Minister David Cameron in particular of a compromise model whereby the court's Paris headquarters would have sub-branches in Munich and London.-- But the diplomatic victory also poses major problems for the government at home."
" All within the European Council of June 20, to allow the Parliament in Strasbourg to vote confidence in the Commission and therefore the new EU to be operational by mid-July. It is a path in forced stages that has in the next three weeks the decisive step, as can be seen from the marathon of bilateral meetings with EU leaders that Macron and Merkel are collecting to collect votes and support for rival projects. In order to then reach the inevitable compromise that will define the balance of forces between the two EU leaders.In this scenario, Italy has strategic interests to protect - as Bankitalia governor Ignazio Visco recalled in Friday's report - but it also has obvious difficulties in exercising an effective role because the Giulietta government is perceived as the spearhead of the populist-sovereignist front that wants something completely different, namely to revolutionize the EU as Matteo Salvini, Marie Le Pen and Nigel Farage, future leaders of the opposition in Strasbourg, have said on several occasions. It is no coincidence that Lega and Cinquestelle will sit in Strasbourg well away from Popular, Socialists, Liberals and Greens. However, this does not detract from the fact that Italy is playing its own game, strengthened by the weight it carries within the Union: it is aiming to win an economic commissioner (Competition, Trade or, in extremis, Agriculture) and to maintain its presence on the board of the ECB, favoring for the succession to Mario Darghi - whose term expires in October - a candidate closer to Paris than to the fiscal rigorism of Berlin."
" Almost lost in the shuffle is that Sebastian Kurz also very clearly named the problem with the FPÖ in a recent interview (with Oe24): They are in bad company in the European Parliament, still in a group community with the right-wing populist to right-wing extremist group of the Front National, with the Dutchman Geert Wilders, with the Lega Nord, and so on. The equally anti-European German AfD is in another, but also anti-European group in the EU Parliament. The FPÖ has the best relations with the AfD and congratulated it on its 13 percent in the elections."

The FPÖ has the best relations with the AfD and congratulated it on its 13 percent in the elections. There's no need for sanctions or anything: anyone who forms a government with this FPÖ has no business in the EU."
" Already this morning Mattarella will plant the first stakes, speaking at Badia Fiesolana at the conference on solidarity in Europe. It will reiterate that Italy has made commitments with the EU and NATO to which it will remain faithful. The League in government would not imply a pro-Russian reversal of our international alliances. It is still too early to predict how far the Colle's vigilance will go with regard to other constraints, such as article 81 (balanced budget)."
" Also because the opposition is not only divided internally. The extreme forces of sovereignty do not have a single line in Europe: they show themselves united only when they attack Brussels. For the rest, they prove to be siderally distant.Lega and FdI are demanding, even contemptuous of Berlin and the EU that would not do enough to help Italy. But their parties of reference in Europe are the most hostile to making concessions."

" Also discussed are public accounts: Conte denies rumors of corrective measures: The economy is not very favorable but it is not the time to talk about it, we are in January and we are optimistic. Salvini already looks ahead to May, to the European elections: It will be 400 million Europeans to decree a new European Renaissance, against a soulless EU.In the CDM there is no talk of Consob, but the agreement between the League and M5S there is on Minenna, says Salvini, an agreement that would not take into account the opposition of the Quirinal and the Bank of Italy on the candidate.© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" Also some spokespersons mentioned the lack of European response to Donald Trump's protectionism. And in some cases, with cross accusations between parties such as that of Albert Rivera, leader of Ciudadanos, against Podemos for being part of the European populists, among which he included the promoters of Brexit, the Greek rulers and the French xenophobes led by Le Pen.Rajoy started the debate with an optimistic message, with references to data on Spain's economic recovery and calling for unity to strengthen the European Union against populism and protectionism."
" Also, both partners must be 21 years old. Leers wants, partly at the initiative of his support partner PVV, to tighten the rules on family reunification, but is encountering problems in Brussels. European Commissioner Malmström (Home Affairs) wants nothing to do with it."
" Although Vienna's political weight is rather small compared to the big players Paris and Berlin, there too voices for a softening of the sanctions have recently increased. A consistent advocate in the EU, as he sees Austria under the government of the ÖVP and FPÖ, is therefore worth its weight in gold for Putin.Even if the Kremlin boss does not want the visit itself to be understood as a reward, he does have a few incentives up his sleeve to keep the Russian-savvy Austrian economy on his side: Of course, the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, for which OMV is eager, will also play a role in the golden wedding of the gas partnership."
" Although instrumental and even obvious, the attack of the leader of the League makes it clear how much the fear and uncertainty of public opinion can be manipulated and exploited: vs. Palazzo Chigi, against the European Union,and in favor of the League.The Carroccio leader can conjure up 50 billion euros for recovery: he doesn't have to explain whether they can be found, nor where."
" Although presidential majorities are often punished in intermediate elections, this would be an undeniable defeat for Emmanuel Macron. In the spring of 2018, the victory in Italy of the populist coalition led by the Italian Interior Minister, Salvini, reinforced the President's determination to make the 2019 European elections a confrontation between ""progressives and nationalists"". The former are determined to strengthen Europe while the latter are working to undo it, like the Brexit supporters in London, the illiberal leaders in Hungary and Poland or Marine Le Pen in France."
" Although some, freelancers for example, who have remained loyal to the party, will still see themselves as such. People like Barbara Kappel, for example, who has now not been nominated for the EU election.Fact is, however, that in the liberal phase of the FPÖ there were still genuine former National Socialists in the party. First and foremost party leader Friedrich Peter, who was very supportive of the founding of the Atterseekreis at the time."
" Although the Government suffered a heavy defeat, it does not regard the vote as binding, and will not affect Government policy, which is to examine the details of the deal before forming a view on whether to oppose it. Tabling the motion on Wednesday, Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley said his party believes the EU-Mercosur trade deal is bad for Ireland, farmers and the environment. We want the Government to stand up for Irish interests and reject this disastrous trade deal, he said."
" Although the government avoided an excessively harsh tone in its pronouncements on the referendum, Rajoy maintains that Tsipras has been the main responsible for the rupture, as 100% of the euro zone countries believe. PSOE leader Pedro Sanchez called on the president for a constructive position in the EU to avoid a Greek exit from the euro, while Podemos, the party that sees itself as a mirror of Syriza, defended Tsipras against what it sees as the ultimatum and blackmail of the creditors.. We stand with the Greek people, who have provided themselves with a democratic government, maintained Rafael Mayoral, spokesman for the party."
" Although the latter have been openly flirting with him for months, Orbán has never presented himself as an ""ally"". However, the nationalists, already in power in Italy, in coalitions in Austria and Poland and leading (or almost leading) the polls in several countries, including France, have a definite advantage: they will benefit from the departure of the British, which will free up 73 seats for the other countries, and from the foreseeable break-up of the EFDD group, founded by Nigel Farage's pro-Brexit Ukip. The RN is therefore moving in all directions in the hard right of Europe, which is likely to obtain elected representatives in May. He hopes to draw the contours of his next alliance."
" Ambitions that the member states have imposed on themselves, and from which a country like the Netherlands also benefits fully. Is the Lower House to be convinced? Traditionally, the Dutch EU contribution has caused heated debate. SP and PVV are squarely against a larger EU contribution, other parties are putting the brakes on. MP Bram van Ojik (GreenLeft) does want to spend more, but asked Koopman on Thursday for help to find the right arguments."
" Amen. The common enemy is the Fiscal Compact but the economic recipes of the Cinquestelle and the Lega diverge radically. Di Maio wants more flexibility from Brussels (like Renzi?) to finance the investments of what he called the smart nation: a recipe made of massive public allocations channeled on technology. Salvini, on the other hand, plans to depart from the Maastricht rules to introduce the flat tax dear to the anti-statist right."
" Among his EU colleagues, SPÖ Chancellor Christian Kern expresses concern about the possibility of the FPÖ joining the government after the National Council elections. They are considered blatantly anti-European, Kern told Austrian journalists at the EU summit in Tallinn yesterday, when asked if he had been approached about the FPÖ. You have concerns there, of course, quite clearly, Kern explained."
" Among other things, it wants to use the revenues to reverse the lowering of the retirement age and introduce tax exemptions for low-wage earners. In the UK, UKIP is not only calling for the Kingdom to leave the EU, but also wants to put three billion pounds more into the health system.There has been little concrete from the German AfD on economic issues so far. In some areas, it still represents the old doctrine from the time of party founder Bernd Lucke."
" Among other things, not to stand in the way of Prime Minister Theresa May. FREE TRADE AGREEMENT The EU's controversial trade deal with Canada can serve as a template for Britain's EU membership, says the British government - and the Danish People's Party. But will the DF also swap Danish EU membership for CETA? As a party, we are supporters of free trade."
" Among the most effective were the irrational fear of foreign infiltration, the contempt for the so-called elites in London and Brussels and the deep-seated suspicion of living in a facade democracy in which a majority is fleeced and a minority is nurtured. In other words: What the Lega is to the Italians, the former Front National to the French, Vox to the Spanish, the AfD to the Germans, Brexit was to many Britons. If it were to be cancelled now, more than two and a half years later, by a slim majority, it could let spirits out of the bottle that would be hard to control."
" Among them are an above-average number of men, people with higher education, people from urban centres and above all ÖVP and Green sympathisers. FPÖ supporters, people over 30 and people with less education rate EU membership particularly low. 41 percent are convinced that Austria's accession has rather brought disadvantages, 22 percent rather see advantages in it."
" Among these phenomena not very favorable to the ruling party, I would include the high turnout for the film &bdquo;Kler showing the symbiosis of the political class with the church hierarchy, tapes of Prime Minister Morawiecki's recorded private conversations, and to a lesser extent issues related to the rule of law and the dispute with the European Union. Because the latter is a developing issue, given Friday's very clear decision by the EU's Court of Justice, which ordered PiS to withdraw from changes to the Supreme Court.For sure, PiS was hurt by the de-Bekaization bill and the attempt to demote General Wojciech Jaruzelski. PiS has repeatedly appealed to an electorate that views the People's Republic of Poland with sentiment, distrustful of liberal parties."
" An EU exit should only be the last resort. Other prominent delegates said it more pointedly: A German exit from the EU would push Europe into chaos, which the AfD does not stand for.As late as midday on Saturday, it looked as if the party leadership could at least get away with its criticism of the hasty Dexit."
" An anti-Israel stance is not done in those conservative American circles. But the PVV leader also wants to go further in Europe. By openly welcoming Marine Le Pen to the Binnenhof, he sends a clear signal: this European cooperation is worth a lot to him. This newspaper asked the PVV about its reasons for inviting Marine Le Pen to The Hague, about the other European parties Wilders has contact with, and about its plans to form a large anti-Europe faction."
" An assembly that has constantly increased its powers, but whose election is generally marked by a low turnout (42.6% in 2014). The scores of Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) in France and Matteo Salvini's League in Italy, declared enemies of French President Emmanuel Macron's European plans, are among the most anticipated results. With the wind in their sails in the polls, the two far-right allies hope to unite a broad alliance of nationalist, Eurosceptic and populist parties."
" An attempt to kill the case by silencing it and isolating it as a question of Morten Messerschmidt has failed. In the Danish People's Party, both group chairman Peter Skaarup and deputy chairman Sørensen Espersen acknowledge that the case has developed into a real crisis for the party, which for years has turned to criticism of the misuse of taxpayers' money in the EU.We have been going through the Danish People's Party's biggest crisis ever, where we have perhaps made the mistake of being too easy-going, says deputy chairman Søren Espersen.The story of the Danish People's Party's use of money from Meld and the associated fund, Feld, has many facets."
" An electoral alliance is not ruled out. In the anti-EU camp, things are getting tight with the FPÖ, Martin and Ehrenhauser. Vienna."
" An end must finally be put to the cost-intensive confusion of responsibilities between the federal government and the Länder. With the FPÖ, narrow-minded EU sceptics were elected. Only time will tell whether Kurz will also be able to tame the FPÖ and turn its rabble-rousers into constructive, reliable politicians who don't keep sliding into extremes."
" An important part of populism is to designate an enemy or culprit, whose elimination will be a crucial part of problem solving. In the case of Brexit, the enemy is the European Union, with the freedom of movement of people that it entails. In the case of populisms such as Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece, there is a political caste whose displacement will solve the problems. This caste imposes austerity in collusion with the European Union, which is also part of the caste, although its elimination is more problematic, but which can be brought to its knees by hard bargaining."
" An increasingly organised coalition of nationalist forces hostile to European integration and European values is gaining traction and cohesion. These forces include the Fidesz party in Hungary, the Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland, the Alternative for Germany, the Sweden Democrats, the Lega in Italy, Marine Le Pen's National Rally (formerly Front National) in France, Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom in the Netherlands and the Freedom Party of Austria.Anti-EU opposition is not new, nor are nationalist parties. However, since the last European elections in 2014, these parties have deepened their cooperation, especially in the area of migration."
" An uncertain factor also remains France, where Marine Le Pen continues her anti-European campaign ahead of next month's parliamentary elections. And in the Netherlands, where the third party, the PVV, now says it wants out of the EU altogether and where another Eurosceptic party, the SP, is ahead in the polls.At a backdrop of wealth loss and high political tensions between North and South, Europe is losing much of its attractiveness to citizens."
" Analysts will of course have a whole host of explanations for this, but there is one question that keeps nagging at me. . How can we send a majority of RN members to Brussels when their own leader, just two years ago, wanted to leave the EU and the euro? How can you spit in the soup one day and, two years later, revel in it?Dominique Mora, Aubagnan (40)"
" And Alfano? He, too, shouts against immigration and makes provisions that favor it. But didn't the League vote against the European Parliament in Strasbourg that Le Pen wants to keep instead? For Salvini, when the roof collapses over your head, these are details. Similar image for the daughter of the founder of the Front: But when the house burns do you look at the color of the upholstery? The truth is that on major European issues our parties are very close."
" And Conte is not forgiven for his agreement with Xi Jinping on the Silk Road, nor his hesitation to recognize Juan Guaidó, Washington's darling, as Venezuela's self-proclaimed president. Against this backdrop, a League disengaged from German Europe, and eager to find alternative shores to the hostile ones in Brussels, becomes a subordinate and therefore useful ally. Ready to go along with American demands; but also required to prove they can meet them."
 And Ireland was a hotbed of Catholicism in Europe. Kwasniewski also reminded those PiS supporters and clergy who criticize the European Union that John Paul II was a great advocate of Poland's presence in the EU..Want to know more? Listen to the podcast! Mikolaj Lizut also spoke with Aleksander Kwasniewski about:
" And Nigel Farage's EU-sceptic group (EFDD) with 45 mandataries, which includes the Italian Five Star Movement. If all the Britons are removed because of the Brexit, a good 100 right-wing, EU-critical to -sceptical MEPs could look for a new home in an EU Parliament reduced to 700 mandataries, as the third-strongest parliamentary group. The FPÖ hopes that Viktor Orbán's Hungarian Fidesz and the PiS from Poland will join, that a few extreme right-wing members will leave, and that the Lega in Italy will gain weight through government participation. Then, according to the calculation, a more moderate Le Pen 2.0 faction would also be conceivable."
" And Poland's position in a changing, increasingly unpredictable and unstable world is, after all, much more difficult than America's. After leaving the Foreign Ministry two years ago, we repeatedly warned publicly that PiS's anti-German and anti-European course would push Poland to the margins of the EU and weaken it internationally for a long time. We also appealed to President Andrzej Duda not to sign the IPN Act, which is harmful to Polish interests, because it will ruin relations with the U.S. and Israel and will have to be withdrawn anyway."
" And although just five years ago it was dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte (VVD) as a false choice and a fake discussion, once again the question of for or against the European Union is at the heart of the elections. In fact, it is Rutte himself who now wants to enter into a public debate with Thierry Baudet, leader of the Forum for Democracy and the most outspoken critic of the European Union. FULL TEXT:That the European Union is anything but a given is also proven by a study published this week by theSee in this context also the Dutch House of Representatives, which last month pronounced on a back afternoon that the largely symbolic words Ever closer Union should be deleted from the European Treaty."
" And an opposition blinded by rage is the opposition PiS dreams of. Everything looks like a fairy tale for PiS? Not really. The cynical game of polexit and emotions around the conflict with the EU is only good for Nowogrodzka until the time comes. Kaczynski must remember that No wonder, because it is the countryside and small towns that have felt the change in the quality of life most strongly after Poland's accession to the EU."
" And anyway, the clash with the Brussels institutions would constitute an excellent electoral platform at the European elections in May, for two forces that proudly call themselves populist. Five Star Movement and League, complicit in the crudeness of some members of the EU Commission towards Italy, seem at ease in the controversy with them. And the more they try to accredit a maneuver that in their intentions would facilitate economic growth and lowering of the debt, the more perplexity grows: not only for the merit but for the fog and confusion that still surround the content of the measures."
" And as the example of Erwin Pröll shows: it also does no harm to portray Stronach as an evil capitalist who wants to buy land and people - and then quickly takes off again when he loses interest. The broad field of EU criticism probably offers even better opportunities for the FPÖ to match Stronach. But there, too, there was bad news for Heinz-Christian Strache on Monday: the Constitutional Court rejected his application against the ESM Treaty on formal grounds."
" And banking union is of course important here. Or whether we can limit welfare tourism with Danish protection rules, said the DF chairman.From the Left, EU spokesman Jakob Ellemann-Jensen is more diplomatic than the government to the DF offer. I think it is very, very positive that there is now a debate about the vote on the patent court, he says."
" And bounce back the refusal to consider vaccinations as a requirement, opening another potential front with government and health authorities. They are pieces of a pre-emptive strategy to unload any difficulties on the EU and Palazzo Chigi: a transversal temptation, which starts from populist formations like Lega and M5S but is not limited to them. It also touches Pd, FI, Iv."
" And even Neos top candidate Angelika Mlinar, who wants a United States of Europe, does not want to disempower Austrian ministers in areas such as education policy. Only the FPÖ's top candidate Harald Vilimsky spoke out clearly against more EU. He called for decision-making authority to be brought back to Austria."
" And even if it were a lie, so what...who doesn't have temptations, who isn't sinful, as Father Director says. The national sovereignty-loving officials of the Law and Justice government are thus very uncomfortable with Brussels, and when the words European Union have to be said in a context other than an insulting one, real suffering is painted on their noble faces. On the one hand, they are driven by an undying love for money (and the more money, the greater the love), on the other by party messages that I will not have us here in foreign languages, that Germany's dictate, that selling children in marketplaces, that gays, lesbians, gender, Sodom and Gomorrah."
" And everything the Europarliament does, in addition, must be covered by the law. The euro parliament is not the mother superior of the EU.Rutte will meet with parliament speaker Schulz in Brussels on March 1, who believes the PVV's point of view goes against European values.0"
" And he finds the attitude of the Freedom Party to the EU quite unclear: On the one hand, they assure that they want to further develop the EU as an active and reliable partner. On the other hand, according to international media reports, an FPÖ MEP is attending the meeting of the right-wing populist group ENF in Prague, calling for the end of the EU. Peter Kolba,"
" And he is on a roll at the moment. According to voters, PiS is fighting the EU for Polish sovereignty with dignity (it recently insulted representatives of the Venice Commission or Commissioner Jourova).This coming weekend Ziobro will add to the furnace."
" And he is vice-chairman of the ENF parliamentary group, where Pretzell has now slipped in as the first German, as Ferrand triumphs. Pretzell is an important tool in the fight against the EU and against MadameThe fact that the AfD's second MEP, Beatrix von Storch, has preferred to switch to the more moderate EU opponents does not bother him. The decisive factor is the common interests with the AfD."
" And he repeats it ad nauseam, the goal: We have to make this spread go down. At ease with the deputiesTo hope that this will happen, he knows that the first to sweeten the adjectives thrown against Brussels must be the leaders of the M5S and the League, and that it is necessary to put a brake on the incontinence especially of Salvini, stinging in calling the recommendations of the EU letters. The public impression and the daily description of Conte, is that of a premier crushed by his two deputies: No crushing - he replies -."
" And if it were to return to the vote, we must go to the elections as soon as possible, without arriving in September.In both cases, for Salvini, it would be a defeat and this is what Di Maio seems to want to seek at all costs. Because Professor Paolo Savona has become the symbol of the Lega's battle against Berlin and Brussels. And because the vote in July would penalize the League, which would have to fish for votes from a pool dried up because of the summer vacations. To make clear the new position of the Movement is the deputy Laura Castelli: It is surprising that Savona, a person of great cultural depth and political sensitivity, has not yet matured the decision to take a step back. On the other hand, if in a few hours you can turn back from the loudly shouted request to send the Head of State to jail without paying the price, imagine moving Professor Paolo Savona from the box of Minister of Economy."
" And if the Dexit decision did play a role, it would be an attempt at blackmail, wrote AfD member of parliament Peter Boehringer on his website. Italy, Hungary and Poland are ""strong net beneficiaries of the EU's redistribution of trillions"" and thus of German taxpayers' money. The EU's right-wing parties may therefore want to force the AfD to cancel its Dexit decision.Not only the Dexit drama at the AfD shows that there is not much more consensus among Europe's far-right than the rejection of Muslim migrants, homosexuals and a ""European superstate""."
" And in December, he gave the green light for Rome's concessions to the European Commission in a dispute over Italy's 2019 budget. Despite this, Liga still clings to the image of a strongly Eurosceptic party and wants to 'change the EU from within' (Marine Le Pen is sticking to a similar formula now). The League's ideological bond with Law and Justice would be a strong anti-immigration line (and the threat of pernicious multiculturalism), and probably also demands to limit the powers of EU institutions from Brussels in favor of a stronger role of EU governments in the decision-making process.A minor Italian conundrum for Poles is Salvini's strongly pro-Kremlin inclinations."
" And in contrast to their originators, the right-wing populists are enjoying great success in most European countries. Whether the Front National in France, UKIP in the UK or the AfD in Germany: right-wing populists are on the rise everywhere.For Europe, they are a major threat not only politically but also economically."
" And in the Federation of Austrian Industry there has been a turnaround - as can be heard unofficially: Few people there have anything to do with the FPÖ, and Heinz-Christian Strache - in contrast to Haider - has never actively sought proximity to business people. Above all, however, the FPÖ's anti-EU policy has permanently frightened off the almost EU-euphoric Federation of Austrian Industries. In addition, the current president of the interest group, Georg Kapsch, harbours a deep, personal dislike for the Freedom Party."
" And in the interview with Thulesen Dahl, nothing but predictable trivialities emerged. The 'new' was apparently that the Danish People's Party also wants a referendum on the EU if Britain leaves. Surprise? Not really, is it? Still, the Pilestrasse editors must have thought it was such a big newsstand bash that readers should be treated to it too."
" And it mobilizes society to such solidarity. In addition, the EU, even if it is not particularly keen on getting into further conflicts with Poland, cannot forgive PiS for such blatant and primitive lawlessness. And it is too risky even for the Law and Justice party to struggle with the EU when the budget for Poland is at stake. Especially since, contrary to the bullish declarations, Kaczynski and Morawiecki are afraid of the EU."
" And nobody wants that. The EU official is not alone. Eastern European diplomats, who show little sympathy for the PVV's point of view on their fellow countrymen, agree: on the role that the Netherlands plays in Europe, such an action has little effect. Representatives of member states bordering the Netherlands also giggle at my question of whether we are now on the penalty bench."
" And nothing is being glorified here.S. 21 Harald Vilimsky, the FPÖ's top candidate in the EU elections, tells the press why he accuses George Soros of meddling and why leaving the EU is not an issue at the moment.S. 4In the upper school, ethics is to be compulsory from 2020."
" And of course I hope that Denmark can remain a member of the Dublin cooperation, so that we can register the people who come to Europe. The Danish People's Party also rejects Danish participation in a new common EU distribution system, which only SF and Radikale Venstre support at Christiansborg.-- But this risks Denmark ending up in a legal pickle."
" And only if that doesn't happen do the FPÖ and AfD want to let the citizens of their countries vote on whether to leave. This is what the recently defeated FPÖ presidential candidate Norbert Hofer said now: If the Union is going wrong, then for me the moment would be when one says: So, now one must also ask the Austrians. Similarly, the AfD: If the EU reforms it is calling for cannot be implemented, board member Alice Weidel told Die Welt, then it would have to be clarified whether a third step is necessary: that in Germany, too, the people decide whether our country should belong to an EU that cannot be reformed. Admittedly, there are also other opinions on this within the AfD: Thuringia's AfD leader Björn Höcke wants an immediate referendum and to leave the EU as soon as possible."

But this is not the majority opinion in the AfD for the time being: Weidel's other scenario corresponds to the party programme."
" And our Swedish ally in the European coalition #NowThePeople (the Left Party, editor's note) progresses and reaches 10%! The president of the Rassemblement National, for her part, expressed her delight on the social network at a bad night for the European Union. The democratic revolution in Europe is underway!"
 And penalties imposed by the CJEU will be deducted from other grants. I deeply regret that PiS with its actions deprives Polish society of money from the EU budget. I appeal to the European Union to continue supporting Polish civil society.
" And quite a few want to teach a lesson. 33 per cent of eligible voters (but 49 per cent of SPÖ supporters) want to teach the government in Vienna a lesson, 39 per cent (here predominantly the FPÖ following) want a lesson for the EU Commission. And almost every second Freedom Party and every fifth ÖVP voter wants a lesson for Othmar Karas."
" And since LeU and the Pd, even if they have not yet fully understood it, are middle class parties, preferred by the wealthy and guaranteed, a three-way alliance - M5S, Pd, LeU - would sanction the birth of a plural left, in which popular representation is monopolized by the Five Stars.D. League leader Salvini is back to challenge the European Union: ready to ignore the 3% ceiling. M5S retorts on citizenship income."
" And since the revolutionary year of 2016, when the British voted to leave the EU and Donald Trump was elected president of the USA, support for the EU has increased. In the most recent Eurobarometer survey published by the EU Commission at the end of 2016, 35 per cent of respondents in Austria said that the EU evoked a negative image in them - in 2015, the figure was 41 per cent.The FPÖ's declared goal in the upcoming National Council elections is to do significantly better than in 2013, when 20.5 per cent voted for the Freedom Party. In order to achieve this goal, Strache and Co."

" And so on. Inducing hysteria in Poland around the possible aggression of modern-day Soviets from the ZBiR is supposed to strengthen PiS and help the party on its way to further conflicts with the EU. (Sasin after the EC decision: The effect of these conflicts and our defense of sovereignty is to be, as intended by Moscow's planners, a formal or actual (all the same) split between Poland and the EU and the United States."
" And that probably also applies to the ER. But back to that scale of anger, at the top of which is the policy of the EU .... and the clever FPÖthis is where the FPÖ cleverly comes in. However, to oppose the EU in this particularly difficult situation instead of actively fighting for the greatest possible solidarity within the EU is not only stupid, it also fundamentally endangers the interests of Austria as a powerless small state."
" And the 'Liberal Alliance' is supposedly in favour - without hesitation and political bureaucracy - of ensuring flexible rules for the benefit of both business and employment, i.e. growth. -- But uha, whine the Enhedslisten, Danish People's Party and LA - the new patent rules will move a piece of sovereignty from Denmark to the community in the EU.Uha, da, da."
" And the Greek Margaritis Schinas, Spanish consort, recalled the duties of the moment: the EU funds are not free money, they require reforms. The calm barons, such as Núñez Feijóo and Fernández Mañueco, called to break with those who do not believe in the EU, such as Vox -although they did not mention it-, which supports the Polish illiberal rebellion against the Community Law, the Court and the Commission. A claim that remained testimonial."
" And the Greens to 9.9 per cent - 3.0 percentage points less than in 2004 with Johannes Voggenhuber as the top candidate at the time. Apart from the FPÖ, Hans-Peter Martin will most likely try to win over EU-critical voters once again. Martin announced in the Vorarlberger Nachrichten at the weekend that he wanted to run again."
" And the Mölzer statements do not support mobilisation. This is rather directed at the national core. The FPÖ's top EU candidate had called the EU a negro conglomerate and compared its regulatory rules to the Nazi regime. Wolfgang Bachmayer (OGM) sees a kind of zero-sum game: Exaggeratedly formulated: Mölzer is unfavourable for the FPÖ, Martin is favourable for the FPÖ. Above all, Heinz-Christian Strache's efforts to lead the FPÖ out of the right-wing corner towards the centre - with the disempowerment of Martin Graf, the courtship of decent, well-adjusted immigrants, the abhorrence of the Nazi regime, which has recently been expressed publicly several times - have been counteracted by Mölzer's statements."
" And the acting minister, Celaá, so protective of subsidized education, before, is now intransigent. Is Podemos compatible with the European Union, wonder those who remember that Iglesias premiered his seat in Strasbourg with a strong anti-European discourse and coinciding with the deputies of Le Pen in the vote against the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the EU. The fear of the ultra-right is being exploited so much that even the lehendakari Urkullu has proposed a cordon sanitaire against Vox."
" And the intentions of the EU sceptics , who should more correctly be called EU enemies, have been clearly stated. Marine Le Pen wanted to destroy the EU. The FPÖ politicians Heinz-Christian Strache, Norbert Hofer and Harald Vilimsky have all recently been talking about an Öxit , a withdrawal from the EU.note the past tense."
" And the left in general to criticize pharmaceutical companies. UNO Podemos acknowledged that it was a good thing that the European Union has taken charge of the centralized purchase of medicines, but criticized the agreements reached with the supply companies.The process to constitute the commission and approve the work plan will now depend on the will of the groups."
" And the next greatest difference (45 points) concerns the European Union: the opinion of Law and Justice supporters is that Poland should retain as much independence as possible within the EU, while opposition supporters would like Poland to strive for as much integration as possible within the EU. The dimension of the relationship between Poland and the European Union is closely related to the issue of the rule of law, which was not included in the CBOS survey: after all, the independence within the EU advocated by Law and Justice essentially boils down to the demand that the EU should not interfere in the process of making courts subservient to the executive power, and the demand for greater integration raised by the anti-PiS movement is connected to the expectation that the EU will be quicker and more effective in putting the brakes on this drive of PiS.Whether Poland will be conservative or progressive in its worldview, and, so to speak, Pisowska's and illegitimate or Europe's and legitimate, arouses the greatest emotion in opposition voters and engages them civically."
" And the purpose must not officially be customs or border control, says Gerd Battrup. When the Danish People's Party is presented with the criticism, the defence is that similar control systems are feasible in other EU countries.The party mentions Britain and Sweden, but neither country can be used as a realistic defence of the DF's wishes, says Gerd Battrup."
" And the sceptics in the Danish People's Party in particular are formulating a campaign that this time will have to be much more nuanced than anything we have seen from their side on EU issues in the past. EUROPEAN ANALYSIS The Danish People's Party will have to take a much more nuanced view of the EU in the referendum on the legal reservation.The big challenge for the Danish People's Party is that the government, together with the Social Democrats, the Liberals and the Conservatives, will do everything to make the vote about Denmark's security.At a time when it is obvious to everyone that we are threatened by terrorism."
" And the third possibility, Van der Bellen reiterating what he said in the election campaign, would be questionable in terms of democratic policy. Van der Bellen is right in the matter - the FPÖ is playing with fire, its anti-EU course would harm the export economy. Nevertheless, it should apply: Whoever is elected with a majority and has a majority in parliament behind him is endowed with a mandate by the electorate."
" And the triumph of France's Rassemblement National under Marine Le Pen may have had less to do with a French desire for national uplift than with the frustration of the disengaged and anger at President Emmanuel Macron's power politics. All this will have an impact on the new right-wing parliamentary group, in which various parties in the European Parliament are to join a group of four made up of the AfD and the Austrian FPÖ, the Italian Lega of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and the Rassemblement. In this group, anti-EU nationalism will not play the decisive role."
" And then of course the migrants, we are on the third boat that does not arrive in Italy, but to respond indirectly to criticism from those who point out that a minister of the Interior should also deal with other things, Salvini insists on the war without quarter to the mafias, the cancellation of penalty discounts for murderers and rapists and also tougher penalties for those who mistreat animals. The crowd cries when Salvini remembers the dearly departed by hugging Buonanno's mother in tears and explodes when the Captain announces a League of Leagues to take Brussels. Next year's Europeans will be a referendum between the Europe of elites, banks, finance, immigration and precariousness, and the Europe of the people and work, Salvini says, reiterating that the project of an international alliance of populists that for me is a compliment."
" And then the European Union, once a source of hope for peace and increasing prosperity; now for many the cause of bureaucracy and loss of national identity. In a number of Western European countries - including the Netherlands - opposition to the EU is growing, but except in The Hague and Almere, the PVV, the most outspoken anti-European party, is not participating in the council elections. In fact, in addition to being an opportunity for the citizenry to speak out about local policies, these elections are also an invitation to pass judgment on the general state of affairs, even to give air to a general sense of life."
" And they know it. So the League and 5 Stars are determined to attack the resistance of the EU, even at the cost of returning to the vote in the middle of the storm on the markets. They have set themselves only one limit, and that is precisely the leverage that investors who bet on our debt can activate."
" And they used it to launch the most successful videos. That of Pablo Iglesias doubting the euro in the midst of the Brexit hangover. And that of the leader of Podemos, on [the TV program] La Tuerka, celebrating having beaten up a policeman. Why Facebook, we asked Natalia Basterrechea, the social network's director of public affairs in Spain: The audience is fundamental. 22 million people log on to Facebook in Spain every month, and politics is a major topic of conversation on the platform."
" And they wanted to ensure that Vienna, as the seat of the UN, would remain connected to the international flight network: Without AUA, Vienna would not be a world city. While the SPÖ had chosen the topical hour on the AUA, the FPÖ used the following Europe hour to address the use of Austrian money for EU funding madness, which they feared. Club leader Herbert Kickl again attacked the ÖVP, which had already been afraid in the coalition with the FPÖ if one wanted to deviate from the European majority opinion, as with the UN migration pact."
" And they're so flabbergasted by the fact that they have 5.5 million votes that they're challenging a constitution that was supported by over 6 million. They doubt the sense of Poland's presence in the EU, which 13 million Poles were in favor of, Kwasniewski said.According to the former president, PiS is wrong when it says that the Constitutional Court could block reform proposals announced in the campaign.- On the programmatic issues that PiS talked about during the campaign, there is no threat from TK."
" And this in a time of great turning points. The European Union is in an existential crisis because of the Brexit, economic stagnation, terrorism and mass immigration. Vision is more important than ever.PVV and VNL are somewhere in between. Behind Wilders and Bosma is an army of bank fillers who are incapable of carrying out governmental responsibility."
" And this is still the defining one today. Essentially, the Strache FPÖ has only two issues: immigration and criticism of the EU, which at its core is also criticism of the elite. So it's similar to the US."
" And this would dangerously deepen the Union's divisions between old and new members. Moreover, the EU turning off the tap on funds could strengthen PiS or Fidesz. The ruling parties in Poland or Hungary would then unleash a campaign in defense of national dignity and sovereignty against the EU."
" And to give a positive signal even Europe, Di Maio would commit to present the economic document in Parliament by the end of April (provided that a government with M5S exists), placing some assurances on compliance with the constraint of deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP and the objective of a balanced budget in the medium term. But on this, Di Maio could clash with the League, which instead intends to ask Brussels to exceed the 3% threshold. The doubts that crowd the mind of the M5S leader on the presentation of the Def to the Quirinale in two days will melt in the coming hours."
" And we are sure that the citizens of Trentino have rewarded us in the European elections and especially in the by-elections because they appreciate the government of doing. Whoever was looking for controversy, and whoever wanted to set political issues against the European Union and the national government, throwing everything into the mix, did not find an answer from our side. The League is the first force in the province, stressed the provincial councilor Alessandro Savoi. For the coalition to win again in the Trent constituency was not a foregone conclusion."
" And we can't accept that. Kenneth Kristensen Berth also points out that even in the event of a limited transfer of sovereignty in the area of justice, Denmark will automatically become a member of the Schengen cooperation at a supranational level, with the consequence that Denmark will be bound by the decisions of the European Court of Justice in this area. And the DF is opposed to this.If you have to choose between not being a member of Europol or being subject to Schengen at a supranational level, which would you prefer? I hope I don't get that choice."
" And with the Danish People's Party, they disappear completely. DF has become the epitome of the reactionary and anti-anything mindset in Danish politics. They are anti-EU, anti-gay, anti-Islam, anti-market, anti-globalization and generally anti-ideology. But when the ideology is gone, the vision and principles disappear."
" And with the establishment of an Integration State Secretariat, it was at least signalled that the issue was being taken seriously. Fifth: What remains for the FPÖ is really only criticism of the EU. And this will - what a surprise - also be the main topic of today's party conference."
" And with this ÖVP, perhaps even more is possible. In any case, Sebastian Kurz should have little or no objection to those demands that the FPÖ leader raised on Wednesday: The FPÖ wants border controls in Austria as long as the EU's external borders are not adequately protected. It demands the rapid removal of illegals from the country, measures against Islamisation and tax relief, above all the abolition of the cold progression."
" And you have to go into the eye of the hurricane, so to speak, to actually bring about change. FPÖ politicians hardly say a positive word about the EU: centralist, undemocratic, too liberal - especially towards migrants. Consequently, your party should actually demand Austria's withdrawal."
" Andreas Khol, candidate of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), declared that he would appoint the leader of the party with the strongest mandate if he found a majority in the National Council - unless the government programme provided for the abolition of the independence of the Constitutional Court. Van der Bellen, on the other hand, rejects such an automatism: he maintains that he will not approve a party like the FPÖ, which wants to smash the EU. Richard Lugner, on the other hand, maintains that he rewards declarations of support with a five-euro cinema voucher, although lawyers consider this to be bribery and thus a punishable offence."
" Another alternative would be the EU mandatary Harald Vilimsky. In Brussels, however, the appointment of the EU-critical mandatary would be seen as an affront.Social AffairsIf the FPÖ gets the post, it will be filled by a key figure. If Secretary General Herbert Kickl does not remain in parliament, he would be a candidate."
" Another controversial issue within the AfD is whether the asylum system according to the Dublin rules and the freedom to travel should be maintained, at least if a complete control and rejection regime were to be established at the EU's external borders. The protection of German borders was called for so often and so emphatically in Magdeburg that it seems to become an end in itself in the AfD.Then there is the question of national debt in the EU. In itself, it is clear that the AfD rejects the communitisation of debts in the euro system and, among other reasons, seeks to withdraw from this common currency."
" Another important motive for the non-voters was dissatisfaction with the EU policy, which costs more than it brings. Those EU critics who did go to the polls mostly opted for one party: the FPÖ. 75 per cent of the liberal voters are of the opinion that EU membership brings disadvantages to Austria."
" Another sign of this good relationship is the involvement of Dutch soldiers in Mali alongside the French armed forces. On the domestic front, the two countries, which have been partners in the construction of Europe since the beginning, are experiencing a common distrust of Brussels on the part of their citizens. As in France with the National Front, the Netherlands is experiencing a strong breakthrough of the populist and anti-European far right, notably embodied by Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV). In this context, the current migration crisis in the EU is providing a new breeding ground for these parties."
" Anyone who demands this is moving outside the constitutional arc in Austria, he said on Wednesday at the opening of the Alpbach Law Talks. FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl wants the ECHR either retreaded at EU level or replaced by an Austrian Convention on Human Rights. Kickl plans to include this demand in the announced FPÖ petition for a referendum."
" Anyone who equates the EU's understanding of democracy with that of the North Korean dictator, even if only in isolated cases, should not be a partner for us. The CSU has entered into a contest with the AfD ahead of the European elections to see who will be more critical of the EU. Was that wise?"
" Anyone who wants to stand for isolationist, protectionist policies, I will fight against. Nor does he have much sympathy for the politicians in the Danish People's Party who this summer criticised the EU's demonisation of Vladimir Putin. Fogh mentions that the same views can be seen reflected in places as diverse as Marine Le Pen in France and in the Greek left-wing party Syriza."
" Apparently, the AfD is seeking cooperation with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, to which the British Tories, the Czech ODS, the Polish PiS and other smaller parties joined in 2009. A merger with the EU-critical party of the Briton Nigel Farage, in the meantime some AfD members sought contact, was not, however, capable of gaining a majority in the AfD..""Please consider if something important is missing Bernd Lucke, AfD leader"
" Approved the Mes, a dramatic mortgage on the future of Italy and our children. The rest, such as the Recovery Fund, will be discussed only later, but already outlines a perennial dependence on Berlin and Brussels. So the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, commented on the decisions of the European Council that for Italy, according to Salvini, are: Defeat, failure, defeat. The heads of delegation of the majority parties with Premier Giuseppe Conte and Minister Roberto Gualtieri have finalized the tables of the Def that record a drop in GDP of 8%, a deficit just over 10% and debt up to 155%."

" April 2015, we broke up the joke on page 1, but had to notice that it had since developed an unstoppable momentum of its own. The Upper Austrian FPÖ Federal Councillor Michael Raml still posted months later: ""The EU cannot ban me from eating crispy schnitzel.Then a real problem arose: The EU Commission presented a proposal to reduce acrylamide."
" Aren't you exaggerating? The consistency of the Law and Justice party and the brutality of their scenario indicate that cutting ties with the EU is a fundamental issue that the party will not back down from. In this context, Polexit is a way to overcome one of several obstacles, namely the limitations on the total power to which PiS and Kaczy ski aspire."
" As a Cepremap study has shown, the pyscho-sociology of those who support the ""yellow waistcoats"" is quite similar to that of RN supporters: they are citizens from working-class categories who do not trust politics (""the system""), or even democracy. The RN's score is also a message of defiance against the European Union. One consolation: the frontist party achieves a lower score than in 2014. 4. Jadot fully succeeds (13.4%) Yannick Jadot was much criticised for refusing to merge his list with a left-wing list."
" As a bargaining chip for the EU election campaign, the Blue Party prefers to return to the issue of migration. The FPÖ sees itself as a reform party critical of the EU, emphasises Harald Vilimsky, Secretary General, MEP and election campaign manager.No more talk of the Öxit."
" As a person, she was able to make up for the failed poster campaign and save fourth place. If you take the opposition, the camp of the EU-friendly (Greens, Neos) and the opponents of the Union (FPÖ) is about the same size. The fact that the EU-Stop party was able to register so many votes is one of the surprises of election day."
" As a precautionary measure, the election target has already been lowered from 33 to around 20 per cent. Harder criticism of the EU. The Styrian leader Gerhard Kurzmann has given a hint of where the right-wing core of the FPÖ thinks the journey should go. Even firmer and more consistent criticism of the EU, including concrete steps for an EU exit, should lead those who are dissatisfied with the federal government into the blue camp instead of to Stronach."
" As a reminder: The controversial anti-foreigner referendum Austria first under FPÖ leader Jörg Haider was signed by around 7.4 per cent of those eligible to vote in 1993. Under FPÖ leader Strache, the party achieved 4.28 per cent in 2006 with its Austria Remain Free petition, which was directed against the EU constitution and Turkey's accession to the EU.In fact, only two referendums have been held in the country so far - the one on the commissioning of the Zwentendorf nuclear power plant in 1978 and the one on Austria's accession to the EU in 1994, the outcome of which is generally known."
" As a result of the Danish People's Party's pronounced EU scepticism, the UK government operated in EU policy throughout the 00s with an alternative EU majority with the Social Democrats, the Social Democrats and the Radicals. -- But in recent years, the Left has moved towards the Danish People's Party, not least on the issue of EU citizens' rights to Danish welfare benefits. Mr Løkke said yesterday that the path is now cleared for Danish EU policy, but at the same time he stressed that the agreement contains great flexibility in relation to new patterns of cooperation in EU policy. When it comes to playing the field, there will probably be plenty of situations, both now and in the future, where we play a bit on each other's team when it comes to the concrete shaping of European policy."
" As an EU-sceptical party, it remains the weak link from the EU partner's point of view as long as it is an active member of the ENF group of extreme right parties in the EU Parliament. It was more than piquancy that the dissolution of the EU was called for at the ENF Congress in Prague when FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache presented the coalition pact with Kurz in Vienna.Not only that, the Chancellor will have to explain."
" As can be seen (column G), they differ most in their opinions about the legal regulation of abortion (56 points on a scale of 0-100 points), same-sex partnerships (55 points) and the attitude toward the Concordat (50 points) - that is, the dimensions forming the axis of conservative Poland (which is supported by an overwhelming majority of PiS voters) versus progressive Poland (which is what most opposition voters want). And the next greatest difference (45 points) concerns the European Union: the opinion of Law and Justice supporters is that Poland should retain as much independence as possible within the EU, while opposition supporters would like Poland to strive for as much integration as possible within the EU.The dimension of the relationship between Poland and the European Union is closely related to the issue of the rule of law, which was not included in the CBOS survey: after all, the independence within the EU advocated by Law and Justice essentially boils down to the demand that the EU should not interfere in the process of making courts subservient to the executive power, and the demand for greater integration raised by the anti-PiS movement is connected to the expectation that the EU will be quicker and more effective in putting the brakes on this drive of PiS."
" As for the populist True Finns party, it is calling - like other Northern European parties - for a split in the euro zone so that the 'rich' no longer have to pay for the 'poor'. Can we then find in the refusal of immigration a common trait of Europhobic parties? This is true for far-right parties such as the FN, the Danish People's Party, the Swedish Democrats, or the British Ukip, but not for ""centrist"" sovereignist parties such as the German AfD, the Polish KNP, or even for the Italian Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement (17 MEPs), which is classified more to the left. Finally, there are the divisions that stem from the image of the parties and explain their difficulties in forming a parliamentary group: Ukip refuses to ally itself with far-right formations such as the FN, and the latter finds parties such as the Greek Golden Dawn or the Hungarian Jobbik decidedly unattractive"
" As for the time horizon, Hofer says: ""If we set the course more in the direction of centralism within a year instead of returning to the basic values, then we would have to ask the Austrians whether they still want to be members here. Norbert Hofer has been considered a possible alternative to party leader Heinz-Christian Strache since the election of the Federal President, in which he was narrowly defeated by the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen. His announcement is therefore not uninteresting within the party, as it would also mean a change of strategy within the FPÖ. Up to now, the Freedom Party has always been critical of the EU, but has never called for leaving the Union - not even Hofer. He is not doing that explicitly now either, but he is setting the course for an Öxit campaign."
" As he announced earlier, his party wants the Netherlands out of the EU, out of the euro and back to the guilder (, the euro is not money, the euro costs money). Our country would then have to conclude bilateral trade treaties with the EU, as Switzerland already does. As long as we are still a member of the Union, the PVV in any case wants the EU flag to disappear from public buildings, starting with the Lower House. The PVV also opposes the European emergency fund ESM."
" As in the election campaign, Van der Bellen had already declared in an interview with ARD Tagesthemen on Monday that he would not give the FPÖ the mandate to form a government if it were to be the strongest force in parliament after the next National Council election. The FPÖ is playing with fire, says Van der Bellen with regard to the FPÖ's EU-sceptical course. Van der Bellen did not want to say more before a planned debate with Strache, which is expected to take place next week."
" As long as there is no progress towards peace in this regard in accordance with the Minsk Agreement on Ukraine with President Vladimir Putin, no one in the Union wants to end the sanctions. The FPÖ, however, has long called for the end of punitive measures against Russia and has also taken a position on this in the EU Parliament, where it is part of the group of extreme right-wing parties led by the French Front National of party leader Marine Le Pen.The weeks after the EU summit will be tricky for the Freedom Party, because the decision of the heads of government (still with SPÖ Chancellor Christian Kern) must be formally fixed in the next EU Council of Foreign Ministers in January, i.e. by the new government and presumably with the new Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, who belongs to the Freedom Party."
" As recently as 9 June, EU rapporteur Kenneth Kristensen Berth replied that a referendum is not topical right now. Still not, but now DF is trying to make a possible 'Daxit' stand and blink for years to come. The DF is probably betting that the turmoil will cause EU opposition to grow.Here at the EU's exit is already the Enhedslisten."
" At Christiansborg, Helle Thorning's hard line is received with cheers by the EU sceptics in both Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti. It is absolutely fantastic if Thorning in this way will guarantee that we get the absolutely fair EU rebate. She must certainly go out the line, we will hold her to it, says DF's chairman, Kristian Thulesen Dahl.Both the Left and the Conservatives agree with the demand for a rebate, but they consider it unwise to threaten so bombastically with a veto now."
" At Jan Roos' VNL things are firmer: 5 billion more to meet the NATO standard, conscription back and ordering an aircraft carrier. The pro-Putin nationalists of Forum for Democracy also want two percent defense spending, but do not mention NATO. In addition to the EU, does Baudet also want to leave NATO? For sovereignists it would be consistent: a 'double Nexit', monetary-economic and military. Kindred spirit Marine Le Pen advocates it for France."
" At a glance Italy's Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, will present the alliance of right-wing populist parties with which the head of the right-wing Lega wants to campaign in the EU parliamentary elections in Milan on Monday. Partners include the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National, the German AfD. The motto of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Alliance is Europe of Common Sense."
" At a glance The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Freedom Party (FPÖ) disagree on many key EU issues: While the ÖVP is in favour of trade agreements such as the one with Canada, the FPÖ is against them. There are also differences on foreign policy issues: For example, the People's Party, in contrast to the Freedom Party, wants to support the EU-Russia sanctions."

There are also differences on foreign policy issues: For example, the People's Party, in contrast to the Freedom Party, wants to support the EU-Russia sanctions. FPÖ MEPs voted completely contrary to the ÖVP on the issue of tax transparency for corporations."
" At a glance The FPÖ easily topped the result of the 2009 EU elections - at that time the party achieved 12.7 per cent. The starting position for the Freedom Party was also particularly good: after the crisis, there is widespread EU scepticism among the population."
" At a press conference yesterday, however, the Farmers' Union already let it be known that due to the good results in the election - the farmers will in future have 16 instead of 13 members in the National Council - they could perhaps hold two ministerial offices in future. On the subject of the EU, the FPÖ has already cleared hurdles out of the way. Since last year, there has been an enormous shift - away from an Öxit, i.e. an exit from the EU, on which the former presidential candidate Norbert Hofer wanted the people to vote, towards a commitment by Hofer to European integration in an interview on Sunday."
" At its birth in 2013, the Alternative was a respectable party, even if the establishment derided the AfD as a professorial club. Legitimate and useful after the 2008 crash was their euro-scepticism, poking at the currency's design flaws, criticising policies that broke EU treaties in the panic - for example, the ban on liability for each other's debts. The AfD preached market economy and fiscal discipline.Somewhat Cathedral-like it was at the time, but right-wing not in the German sense, but in the Anglo-Saxon sense, that is, without the national whispering, resentment and racism that runs from the NPD to the Reps."
 At least that's what he thinks. Er addresses his love of his homeland in the film and warns against the paternalism of the EU. Terminology reminiscent of FPÖ rhetoric. Did his political views come up behind the scenes?
" At present, such a group would have about 80 members. On Monday, Louis Alliot, former RN MEP, said he was in negotiations with Nigel Farage's Brexit party, which will have 29 members in the new assembly.The problem is that this alliance, if confirmed, will be short-lived as the UK is supposed to have left the EU by the end of October and will therefore have no MEPs by that date."
" At that time, 46 per cent saw personal disadvantages from EU membership, only 24 per cent said they saw mostly advantages. Over the course of 15 years, the ratio has reversed: today, 48 percent see personal advantages in EU membership, only 22 percent see disadvantages. It is mainly declared FPÖ voters who see the majority of disadvantages in the European Union.This finding is essentially in line with the Eurobarometer survey published the previous week, which placed the EU's standing among Austrians at an all-time high."
" At that time, the group said no to the controversial nationalists from Denmark. But the DF has undergone a political journey, says MEP Syed Kamall of the British Conservatives. There is a difference between being a party that wants to control immigration and demonise immigrants, says Kamall."
" At the EU level, however, it is in no way a suitable partner. The FPÖ is working in Europe with forces that want to abolish the euro, destroy the EU, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, abolish liberal democracy and undermine the debt crisis. All these points are directed against Austrian interests. The mask must finally come off so that people can see that this policy harms Austria."
" At the EU level, however, it is in no way a suitable partner. The FPÖ is working in Europe with forces that want to abolish the euro, destroy the EU, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, abolish liberal democracy and undermine the debt crisis. All these points are directed against Austrian interests.Talking about the now dissolved coalition agreement, in which the FPÖ had also committed itself to a pro-European stance, Karas says that this has already been broken by the Freedom Party's choice of partner."
" At the FPÖ federal party conference in April 2002, she had clearly stated that the FPÖ would not agree to Czech accession to the EU as long as the Czech Republic adhered to the Benegsh Decrees and the impunity law for the crimes committed against the Sudeten Germans. At the same time, she had already agreed with Chancellor Schüssel that the FPÖ would be content with a formal protest and would not offer any real opposition to EU enlargement. When this became known after a few months, a great many delegates felt lied to and betrayed by the party leadership and the desire arose in many places for a special party congress to discuss this question."
" At the RN, they only talked about this (and immigration) during the whole campaign, with superlatives, like ""history with a capital H"", and they assure that ""it's going to be huge. It is the consequence of the inexorable rise of the peoples, it goes beyond the European Union, it is the natural order of things, it will not stop. Within the RN, they praise the ""Europe of nations"", a meeting of nationalist parties entering the future European Parliament, and in Italy, they say ""League of Leagues"". Several Eurosceptic formations, until now scattered in three groups in Strasbourg (ECR, EFDD, ENL), are to be merged into a single group, the largest possible, to, they say, ""replace"" those who are today ""at the head of this totalitarian system that is the EU, and give power back to the people"", warned Le Pen in October, during a press conference with the Italian Minister of the Interior."
" At the same moment, the Czech warned that this would lead to an economic and security meltdown for the Czech Republic. -- But that does not deter the DF from thinking about a new cooperation between Britain, Denmark and like-minded countries with Eurosceptic governments. There is no core left."
" At the same time, an anti-Hofer campaign was launched - financed with money from the industrialist Hans Peter Haselsteiner - which portrayed the FPÖ candidate as a supporter of the Öxit. With disastrous consequences for Austria, as the campaign explained, which with its simple slogans was in no way inferior to the populist election campaign pattern of the FPÖ. But Norbert Hofer, who had to declare umpteen times during the election campaign that he did not want Austria to leave the EU, was thus put on the defensive on this issue.Conversely, Van der Bellen also found himself on the defensive at times during the election campaign."

" At the same time, he acknowledged that the Left and several other parties have contributed in recent years to highlighting the negative elements of Danish EU membership. Søren Gade's statements in the TV debate made such an impression on the TV host that he asked Søren Gade if he would rather be placed on the anti-EU side of the debate table, in the company of Anders Vistisen of the Danish People's Party and Rina Ronja Kari of the People's Movement Against the EU.That Gade did not answer clearly."
" At the same time, parties that used to be firm allies on EU issues are now so divided that a break with 30 years of consensus-oriented Danish European policy is being predicted. One of the reasons why the previous civil peace on EU policy is breaking up may be the fear among pro-EU parties that the Danish People's Party will win votes on the basis of its anti-EU stance. At the same time, many parties perceive Danes to be on the sceptical side when it comes to the EU."
" At the time, few people in Christiansborg were aware that a political crisis was about to engulf the Danish People's Party. Kristian Thulesen Dahl and the other DF leadership had been informed that several media had new details in the case of misuse of money from the European alliance of EU-sceptic parties, Meld, of which the Danish People's Party has been a member. But in the midst of fairyland in the Landstingssalen at Christiansborg, they had no idea at the time how big a problem it would become."
" At this time it is not necessary to be timid with the EU, but to defend the Italians. The M5S must do its part and make its voice heard for the good of citizens, added Buffagni, one of the party's economic experts, who had already pushed other times to force the budget parameters of the EU.Open doors from the opposition. Of course, the League is ready to vote immediately a resolution in Parliament to overcome the European parameters, otherwise you can not allocate the resources needed to address the crisis, said Massimo Garavaglia, former deputy minister of Economy. Even within Forza Italia, the orthodoxy of the Maastricht Treaty breaks down."
" Austria has no close cooperation partners in the EU and should therefore broaden its perspective. Again there are warnings about the EU policy of the expected ÖVP/FPÖ government. This time it's about Visegrád fantasies that are far removed from reality (Paul Schmidt, Der Standard, 23."
" Austria is already undermining the EU by allowing OMV to align itself ever more closely with Russian energy policy. And then, even in this variant, the anti-EU FPÖ remains.Austria would of course do better to side with Merkel/Macron than to join forces with the authoritarian Eastern Europeans."
" Austria's diplomats have done a really good job, as even high-ranking German Social Democrats say. Not a few observers, especially on the left of the narrow centre, expected a mixture of embarrassment and attempts to destroy the European Union from within or above on the political side - especially in the ranks of the FPÖ ministers. This expectation was not fulfilled, there may have been mishaps and failures, such as those experienced by the Minister of Social Affairs, but the big laugh, the big outcry, the big attack did not materialise."
" Autonomies are part of a constitutional system that has given us the best 40 years of peace and prosperity. Vox does not have an alternative model. And I disagree with its position on the EU. Undermining the foundations of our integration in the EU is not the best option.Q.- In the debate on gender violence, what is your position? A.- It is the same as when we did not vote in the Plenary in favor of 8-M, because we understand that the left has hijacked the gender ideology and has hijacked the concept of feminism."
" BBC, CNN, Spiegel, Süddeutsche Zeitung - all pointed it out. Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl had audible trouble distancing herself from the FPÖ and denying any connection between Austria's departure from the EU line and the FPÖ treaty. She could not convince the moderator, as could be heard."
" Back in 2012 during the referendum on the EU Fiscal Treaty, which Sinn Féin strongly campaigned against, McDonald and Farage appeared together calling for a No vote in a national radio debate on Today FM chaired by Matt Cooper. Incidentally, another bizarre link between the Brexit Party and Sinn Féin has become something of an election issue in the north of England."
" Back to the wrangling T-Austrians' relationship to the European Union has always been ambivalent, and the statements coming from the two governing parties in this EU election campaign are also ambivalent: Somebody will like it. coalitionThe FPÖ has a comparatively easier time of it than the ÖVP. Oppositionalism is in their genes, even in their fourth participation in government at the federal level: When in doubt, being against (whatever) goes down well with the liberal voters."
 Bad company The FPÖ is an anti-EU party. Item.
" Bardella (RN): European elections a referendum on Macron's policy Paris (AFP) - The European elections will be a referendum on (the) policy of Emmanuel Macron, says the new head of list of the National Rally Jordan Bardella, whose activists largely support the yellow waistcoats. Of course, European issues will be very present, but more than ever, the national context will determine the election,"" says Mr. Lepage."
" Bardella (RN): European elections a referendum on Macron's policy Paris (AFP) - The European elections will be a referendum on (the) policy of Emmanuel Macron, says the new head of list of the National Rally Jordan Bardella, whose activists largely support the yellow waistcoats. Of course, the European issues will be very present, but more than ever, the national context will make the election, says Le Parisien M. Bardella, also the movement's spokesperson, in a first interview since his appointment to the post a week ago."
" Bardella. Members will be able to vote on issues that divide the Front, such as membership of the EU or leaving the euro. The FN should defend monetary sovereignty and make this issue a priority--these questions divide the party, especially since the departure of Florian Philippot, and the answers of the members could justify a change of line, a possible right-wingization or a gumming up of the anti-euro and anti-EU diatribes.Other traditional FN themes, such as immigration, are addressed: should it remain one of the main themes of the programme? Should it be drastically limited?"
" Barroso out of touch with reality, says Sinn Féin EUROPEAN COMMISSION president Responding to Mr Barroso s call for a European federation of nation states, Senator Reilly said this was a pipe dream . Sinn Féin has consistently warned that a federal Europe is the ultimate goal of those at the helm of the EU project. However we were always dismissed as scaremongers, she said."
" Basically unthinkable for VdB, but also for Sebastian Kurz, who has mentioned a pro-European stance as a prerequisite for a government. Norbert Hofer has already put forward the idea of an Öxit from the EU (as has practically the entire FP cadre), the FPÖ is in a group in the EU parliament with rabid anti-EU parties such as the Front National and also wants to form a bloc in the EU with the right-wing authoritarian and largely anti-EU Visegrád states (Hungary, Poland, now also the Czech Republic). On top of that, the FPÖ has signed a friendship treaty with Putin's party in Russia and expresses sympathy for separatists (Strache for the Brexit, Hofer for the Catalans)."

" Basque, Catalan, Valencian or Galician nationalism is as dangerous and pernicious as Spanish nationalism. Spain must be rid of all nationalists, and the EU is a vaccine against them. Q.- Does Vox seem to you as dangerous for Europe as Salvini or Le Pen? A.- Vox, when it grows up, will become as dangerous for Europe and Spain as Le Pen for France, the Brexit supporters for Great Britain, Salvini for Italy or Podemos for Spain. I do not see in Iglesias or in Tsipras [leader of Syriza in Greece] anything better than in Vox.P.- The poll published yesterday by EL MUNDO predicts a notable fall for the PP in the European elections, from 26.1% to 16.8%."
" Baudet reportedly shocked the House of Representatives by saying that the EU has a preconceived plan to replace the white European race with African immigrants. In the debate, the FvD leader literally said that the EU has turned out to be a kind of immigration machine. That would set up ferry services to transfer immigrants from Africa to Europe to weaken national identity so that there will be no more nation states."
" Bayrou: ""Let's not make Eurosceptics an obsession"" We must stop making them the obsession of this election! Those who only talk about the National Front are campaigning for the Le Pens instead! The message of the pro-Europeans is so strong that we should not fear any opponent: the world speaks for us! The world today is China, it is Putin, it is the arms race and intimidation, and financial superpowers, and terrorist or criminal networks. In this world, the question is simple: will France and the European countries be stronger if they are united or divided, together or each for himself? We answer without hesitation: we will be stronger if we are united."
" Because for the functioning of the internal market with its four freedoms and other principles of the Union, it does not matter who has to work on Good Friday and who does not. And for many, the ECJ ruling is another example of excessive regulation and interference by the EU - a criticism that the FPÖ in particular is likely to take up in the upcoming European election campaign. But the overall picture is much more complex, lawyers stress."
" Because it is very easy for citizens to get the impression that the AfD not only wants to instrumentalise the chaos for itself, but also to make it even bigger. There is a real danger here for the AfD, as was shown at the end of June after the British Brexit referendum. While the AfD gave a friendly to euphoric welcome to the British exit from the EU, the Germans, fearing for the good European order, rejected Brexit by a large majority in polls, leaving the AfD pretty much alone with its criticism of the EU."
 Because it would be a mistake. There is no pressure within the joint EU group from the Front National on the FPÖ?The cooperation at European level is a working level.
" Because one thing is clear: if the EU and national governments do not act effectively together as soon as possible, Europe's citizens will rightly vote this system out of office. The Union and especially our Alpine Republic have gone limp, while hungry political forces to the right of centre and deeply critical of the EU and the system, such as Front National, AfD and the Strache-FPÖ, are growing ever stronger and knocking loudly on the doors of governments. These repositioned parties - I call them social conservatives because they combine socialist social policy with conservative social positions - are currently the future."
" Because the CDU/CSU wants a limit and the SPD is going along, a dispute has arisen between the presumed grand coalition partners on the one hand and the Greens on the other. The AfD was not to be taken seriously because its MP Christian Wirth invented a UN and EU agenda whose aim was to promote migration from Africa and the Middle East in order to break the back of the nation states in Europe.Sometimes it's just a lack of rhetorical skill."
 Because throwing oneself into the arms of Iglesias without being able to make a useful and responsible opposition does not look like good business. The sudden abstention on the EU-Canada free trade agreement has been a first nod to Podemos. And everything indicates that this will be repeated with the refusal to negotiate the spending ceiling.
" Because we also want to gain breadth, said Strache, alluding to Stenzel's anchoring in bourgeois-liberal voter strata: We are using the historic opportunity for a political change (at the provincial level, note). Moreover, Stenzel would show what FPÖ government policy looked like: We were often of the same opinion on the matter, said the FPÖ leader. In her diction, Stenzel had already adapted well to the FPÖ diction on Tuesday: Saudi Arabia has more than enough money, the sanctions against Iran are over: where is their commitment in the refugee crisis? The EU, on the other hand, is paying for 70 per cent of the refugee camps. And with the refugee onslaught, the FPÖ was the only party to show a sense of reality, while the other parties refused to accept reality, said Stenzel: ""This development had been foreseeable for a long time. Nevertheless, the federal government and the EU were completely overwhelmed by it. Stenzel's demand: differentiation between war refugees, who are granted asylum, and economic refugees, who are sent back."
" Because when asked, as in our Ipsos poll, whether they want to end the euro and return to the franc, 70% of them want to remain in the euro zone. This attachment to the European currency is confirmed by PS (79%), MoDem (83%) and UMP (76%) supporters. Only the FN is opposed to the euro (62%), while 34% of its supporters want to keep it. Marine Le Pen is not unanimous within her own political family on a crucial issue."
" Because, he reasoned: I want to have a pro-European government. Hofer eats chalk. The FPÖ candidate defended himself against this. He sees a crisis in the EU, wants to make it a union of the people, to develop it further. The FPÖ is also committed to the EU in its party programme."
" Before long, they may find themselves in government - and responsible for ensuring that Danish law complies with international obligations. By all accounts, a self-confident Danish People's Party will be the government's support party by then. Will the Left and Conservatives then conduct EU policy with Kristian Thulesen Dahl? The Conservatives' EU election campaign claims that the party 'looks after Denmark in the EU'. But who really looks after the EU in Denmark? The parties that have always believed in the European project should."
" Before the accession, he was evasive on this issue, during the debate before the referendum he suggested for some time to vote no, but eventually changed his position. After joining the EU, the only real argument for PiS to accept Poland's membership in the EU were the financial benefits, especially subsidies for farmers, for whose votes Kaczynski's party competed first with Samoobrona and then with PSL.However, the experience of governing in the current term of office has poured into the hearts of Law and Justice leaders the fear that EU membership is blocking the party's key political intentions - with the plan to gradually take over all the sensitive institutional centers and gain full power over the state and control over the life of society (or at least gain the potential opportunity to reach for it) at the forefront."
" Behind them are EU-sceptical to extreme right-wing parties, which until Britain's EU exit had still been relatively clearly demarcated from each other. British Conservatives in the ECR wanted nothing to do with some of the overt racism and some of the ID group's rides, which include Italy's Lega, Marine Le Pen's French ex-Front, the FPÖ and, since the EU elections in May 2019, the AfD. But this chapter is closed with Brexit."
" Belonging to a generation for whom Europe and globalisation are part of the concept of life as an area of opportunity. It is threatened by Trump, AfD and Brexit thinking. Defended by Martin Schulz."
" Beppe Grillo said no (as always) to the Jeanne d'Arc of the French right, while Matteo Salvini (on behalf of the League) appreciated the invitation. It is quite clear that the euro now has many enemies on the continent, and there are many of our compatriots who harbor hostile feelings towards the common currency and also against the bureaucrats and bankers in Brussels and Frankfurt.Allied or not, the 5 Star Movement and the League will set their election campaign on these issues, capable of capturing an important slice of the electorate. Renzi has a month and a half to tick off the weapons of the Euro-sceptics and Euro-enemies: he must act fast to gather consensus in Italy and concessions from the European Commission."
" Beppe Grillo's M5S distanced itself from Ukip allies by passing the resolution. Forza Italia and the other center-right MEPs lined up compactly in opposition, along with the Northern League led by leader Matteo Salvini. With this vote, the EU Parliament has forgotten the value and meaning of the traditional family - said Elisabetta Gardini, on behalf of Forza Italia MEPs -. We strongly reaffirm a child's right to grow up in a family with a dad and a mom."
" Berlusconi begins again with two radio appointments. To say that his government will be deeply pro-European, that in Brussels they are afraid of M5S and not the League, that of Fornero we will correct the injustices, without endangering the accounts.Mentre returns to campaigning there is also his daughter Marina, president of Fininvest, which denies some reconstructions: there was no rant to the staff of his father for having subjected him to too many appointments, indeed there are the highest esteem and total appreciation for the work done, at various levels and in different areas, the people who most closely today are following the father in his business."

" Bernhard Rösch, a member of the Vienna FPÖ parliament, announced on Friday that his party would demand the closure at all levels if the Chamber of Labour and the ÖGB did not refrain from opening the counselling centre. The background for the sharp attacks by the Freedom Party at the beginning of this year is above all the upcoming Chamber of Labour elections in the individual federal provinces in the spring and the EU elections on 25 May 2014. The immediate reason for the increased outcries by FPÖ politicians is the new EU elections, which came into force on 1 January 2014. The opening of the domestic labour market to workers from Romania and Bulgaria has now taken place since 1 January."
" Blue Crimea visit: ÖVP angry Karas: Disavows EU foreign policy Vienna The visit of two FPÖ politicians to the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia seriously irritates the potential coalition partner ÖVP. He was of a completely different opinion than the two, said party leader Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday."
" Blue politicians who hatch Ibizan deals, babble about Umvolkung, Tugendterror and Willkommensklatschern, brown word reports marginalise as individual cases, call migrants rats and the EU a negro conglomerate, and who flirt with the neo-Nazi scene. This also meant FPÖ politicians who use anti-Semitic codes, make stupid puns with - Jewish - names, cultivate creepy songs, would like to put asylum seekers in concentrated departure centres, are outraged by the name Mehmet in schoolbooks, are horrified by faggots and negroes, subsume Holocaust denial under freedom of thought and post grandma's biscuits are the best! to a photo of an elderly woman taking biscuits in the shape of a swastika out of the oven.This brutal list of right-wing monstrosities could go on and on, so please excuse the incompleteness of the list."
" Blue state leaders keep their distance from Mölzer Showdown in the executive committee Lawyers give ads against FPÖ man little chance Vienna Andreas Mölzer's FPÖ top candidacy for the EU elections will remain in limbo until Wednesday, when the blue party executive committee will decide on the matter: Neither he nor the FPÖ leader wanted to comment on Monday on the debate that Heinz-Christian Strache has scheduled for the afternoon. Officially, two FPÖ state leaders distanced themselves from Mölzer's comparison of the EU with the Third Reich and his description of it as a Negro conglomerate. Johann Tschürtz (Burgenland) and Markus Abzwerger (Tyrol) said the statements were unacceptable and necessary."
" Both are wrong. For what we have to decide is whether we as Danes believe in the importance of the EU - and whether we trust our elected politicians in Parliament to manage our membership.The Danish People's Party is leading a No campaign that seems to have as its primary purpose to drown the doubters in a tide of semi-legal claims that Denmark can be part of Europol and its environs, even if we vote No.DF has in a short time reached their third explanation of how to knit it together: First it was a parallel agreement, then it was a limited opt-in, and now we're going to have the EU rewrite the treaty for us."
" Both countries today struggle to present credible interlocutors in Europe: Theresa May has left on the sidelines all the personalities who know the EU, while recently the Hague premier Mark Rutte complained because - he said - in Italy I don't know who to talk to. There is also the common habit of falsehoods: from English inventions about the curvature of cucumbers imposed by Brussels, to the League's accusations that Europe provides for prison for those who sell clams that are too small. In London as in Rome, the highlight of this propaganda is always the how much we pay, the contribution of the country to the EU budget: no one ever says that it is a sort of entrance ticket to a European market in which we export every year fifty times more than we pay."
" Both parties have themselves moved to the right in recent years on immigration policy and can also see that the majority of their voters are no longer opposed to close cooperation with the large Danish People's Party. Today, none of the three parties opposes a government with the DF. Quite the contrary.Factually, many leftists expected the DF to join already after the EU referendum in December. The LA may demand a price in the form of tax cuts and even try to get in."
" Both parties want to appear as protectors of the welfare state, but neither wants to share responsibility for the binding cooperation with the countries that surround us. Yes, the Danish People's Party says it supports the EU's single market, and unlike the Enhedslisten, as you know, it is standing for election to the European Parliament. But the internal market consists first and foremost of all the rules that the Danish People's Party has a party to ridicule, and of the institutions that must ensure that the individual countries respect the rules that we have agreed together."
" Both the estimated costs of the outlined measures and the revenues amount to 17.2 billion euros. For one not insignificant measure, the PVV did not know the financial consequences: exit from the EU. While a study commissioned two years ago still showed that a Nexit would bring in billions more in the long run."
" Brexit Party uses video of McDonald against EU NIGEL FARAGE'S Brexit Party is using video clips of Mary Lou McDonald as part of its campaign to undermine the European Union.The party's YouTube page features a montage including a variety of contributions made by the Sinn Féin leader during her time as a member of the European Parliament. The video dates from 2008 when the Lisbon Treaty was being debated ahead of the first referendum, when it was rejected by Irish voters."
" Britain's 'special status' shakes the most unionist. But it is also a bid to save the EU through necessary change.Take the Danish People's Party, the Danish right wing's most outspoken eurosceptics. The DF has largely inspired Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's (V) strong support for David Cameron in the European negotiations - partly in the hope that the British deal could pave the way for restrictions on European immigrants' social rights in Denmark."
" Browne quizzes McDonald over Sinn Féin policy BROADCASTER Vincent Browne has chaired a public Sinn Féin event dealing with the issue of Brexit.The former TV3 presenter sat at the top table for the gathering alongside Mary Lou McDonald, Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Damian McGenity from Border Communities Against Brexit."
" But British Ukip is within the spectrum of conservative politics; it opposes immigration and Britain's membership of the EU, but is neither racist nor extreme nationalist and wants nothing to do with LePen. The German anti-euro party AfD, on the other hand, takes Ukip's anti-Europeanism too far; after all, the AfD criticises the euro precisely because it believes that the common currency destroys the community. This is how one could think through the other protest parties, from Beppo Grillo's anti-political Five Star Movement in Italy to various central European national liberal parties to the case of Greece, where radical left and extreme right are united in their rejection of the austerity policies imposed on the country."
" But Europe is the longest-running and most successful peace project in world history. Geert Wilders, on the site of the PVV: A departure from the EU will make our country sovereign again and in charge of its own country, money and borders and therefore also economically stronger. Staying in the EU means open borders even longer and importing even more terror and Islam."
" But I would be in favour of a referendum if Turkey joins. The FPÖ's leading motion explicitly states that leaving the EU is not a taboo, but a last resort if the Union develops into a centralised state and tramples on the principles of subsidiarity and democracy.Yes, Ultima Ratio is the last resort."
" But Navalny's affair is proving to be a problem for the Kremlin on the international level: yesterday the EU Parliament passed a resolution condemning the poisoning, calling for an international investigation and inviting member countries to decide on new sanctions against Moscow. The Italians voted in no particular order: the PD in favor, among the 532 yes; the League against, among the 84 no; M5S and Fratelli d'Italia among the 72 abstainers. The hemicycle in Brussels has also approved yesterday by an overwhelming majority a resolution to sanction the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and condemn him for the violent repression of opponents: 574 yes, 37 no and 82 abstentions. The MEPs of the League abstained."
" But Salvini and Meloni contest Renzi But concord and unity of purpose, in Italy, are rare commodities. So much so that the leader of the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, yesterday, after having asked Renzi and the President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, to immediately convene an EU-NATO-Russia summit and immediately withdraw the Brussels sanctions against Moscow, attacked the Prime Minister: Renzi? If you do not control the borders and do not expel illegal immigrants you are an accomplice of terrorists. And Renzi, who together with Europe gives 6 billion to Turkey that finances the Isis, is an accomplice, said the Northern League leader."

" But Stix reports from his travels that the Turquoise-Blue coalition has been well received by investors abroad. The FPÖ is no longer seen as the bad party. Because on the one hand, they would have clearly softened their anti-EU line. On the other hand, the Freedom Party is no longer isolated in the face of a Europe-wide shift to the right."
" But a majority of Danes rejected that scheme in a referendum last December. A central argument from the no side - led by the Danish People's Party - was that Denmark could just make a so-called parallel agreement with the EU instead.Such an agreement would give Danish police less access and influence, but still maintain a link to Europol."
" But according to political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, Ms. Le Pen's speech on Sunday in Fréjus (Var) was written by a megretist executive from the 1990s with immigration and identity at every level. In the south-east, the RN president devoted almost 40 minutes out of 50 to the EU's insane immigration policy and Emmanuel Macron's submission to it.It's a very well-directed speech,"" her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who chaired the party for nearly 40 years before being expelled in 2015, told AFP, although he is usually very critical of his daughter."
" But as far as specifically an EU referendum is concerned, he spoke against launching a new campaign tomorrow. But the Berlin AfD regional association has already begun precisely this campaign. EU referendum in Germany too, they demanded on Twitter. We demand a referendum in Germany immediately. Very similar to Höcke: I demand a referendum on whether Germany should remain in the EU. He knows that the majority of the German people also want out of EU slavery."
" But as for the Italian attacks, it is immediately apparent that he has the proverbial pebble to shake off: The difficulties come from the excessive debt incurred by previous governments, and from the irresponsibility of the national supervisory authorities. Previous governments to the current one, at least as far as Italy is concerned, is a phrase that is synonymous with Berlusconi, PDL and Lega Nord. There is a myth that the EU imposes hard policies - Barroso warns again - but it is not true. And as if to leave no doubt, he then specifies that he knows very well how many have supported such a myth in front of their own public opinion, but this is unfair."
" But at least the large increase in parts of Austria once again provides strong confirmation of blue strongholds, for example in many districts of Styria. And this despite the fact that the FPÖ had to replace its EU front man Andreas Mölzer with Harald Vilimsky, who was actually second in the top duo, because the German-national EU mandate holder compared the EU with the Third Reich and, among other things, used the term Negro conglomerate.Vilimsky also castigated Brussels' centralism and excessive bureaucracy, but in a deliberate tone."
" But detaching responsibility from the exercise of power is impossible when you are the country's second largest party and have built your critique of the EU on a credo about the system's root in the economy, while merrily spending citizens' money. MARK hides its greed behind commercialized philanthropy, the Danish People's Party hides its greed behind criticism of the power elite in Brussels. Both positions have been exposed as hollow."
" But during the campaign you said that if you don't get your plan A, you will support a referendum. My question is: Do you still want to? We will deal with the situation if a parallel agreement is not reached, when it has not been reached, says Thulesen Dahl, who speaks of a political game, where the Danish and the EU system are in a very good position, if it ends with another vote.Other 'no' parties shun DF During the election campaign, the Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance, the Greens and the People's Movement against the EU joined forces in a declaration in which, in addition to the desire for a parallel agreement, they also mentioned the alternative of a limited opt-in system as an emergency solution.Now, however, the message from the DF creates division on the no team."
" But five days after their triumph in the European elections, Marine Le Pen and In a packed press room in Brussels, Le Pen announced Wednesday afternoon that her Front National, along with the PVV and others, wants to start an anti-European group in the European Parliament. And that will be at least at the expense of the alliance Farage himself envisions around his British UKIP."
" But former minister Ida Auken notes in a post on Facebook that it is much shorter to the Left with Kristian Jensen in the lead than to the Danish People's Party, and that Mette Frederiksen must choose whether she wants to lead the country in a progressive and green direction with us, or whether she would rather fight for the past and the status quo with the DF. DF: We support Løkke - right now Party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl (DF) is unable to elaborate on the double interview with Mette Frederiksen due to holidays, but finance spokesman René Christensen (DF) acknowledges that his party may have difficulty reaching agreement with the parties in the red bloc on the EU and immigration and integration policy. This does not change, he explains, that the political landscape seen through DF glasses is in disarray."
" But he didn't bat an eye at the anti-German accents of compatriot Eleftherios Synadinos. Many of the loudest applause came from the benches of the National Front and the Northern League. Tsipras, who listened smugly to Farage and Le Pen, cannot help but realize that he is bringing water to the mill of the Union's enemies. It may not be your goal, but the result is devastating."
" But he does not plan to join him. In 2007, his analysis was simple and has hardly changed since: FN voters are mostly former RPR voters disappointed by Chirac's recentering and pro-European evolution, and the rest are former communists nostalgic for the time when the CP was conservative, authoritarian and nationalist.Patrick Buisson and Philippe de Villiers have much in common: strong Catholic convictions, nostalgia for eternal France, a visceral distrust of Islam and a detestation of a federal Europe."
" But he refuses to be soft. He would like to see future government cooperation with the Danish People's Party and assumes that the supporting party will be willing to compromise on EU policy in this situation. I think it is, he says, adding a not-so-subtle point: But there are some things in the debate that you have to remember to highlight."
" But he remains quite alone in this opinion. In May, the political rebels of the AfD celebrated their entry into the EU Parliament: With their core theme, criticism of the euro, they gained seven percent from a standing start, and Lucke raved about a new people's party. Less than six months later, the euphoria of the seven AfD MPs has given way to disillusionment."
" But he was one of the members of a government with quintessentially pro-European chromosomes. In an M5S-Lega executive, however, it would embody an even theoretical approach against Brussels institutions and European financial constraints. And therefore would fuel fears of a de facto destabilization of Italy and its alliances."
" But he was wrong in several respects: Norbert Hofer lost to the Green candidate, Alexander Van der Bellen. And the FPÖ no longer propagated a referendum on leaving the EU even in this presidential election campaign, because it did not see the mood in Austria sufficiently pronounced for this. But it could have turned out differently: In view of the mass migration experienced in 2015, the mutual blockade of EU member states to solve this problem and growing fears among the Austrian population of a change in their homeland, a victory run by nationalist forces would also have been possible."
" But he, Hofer, does not assume that anyone wants that at the moment. Even the EU Commission President, who is in himself very centrist, Possibly Hofer's clarification that the FPÖ does not want to leave the EU also has to do with the latest findings of opinion research: a recent survey shows that Austrians have changed their minds after the Brexit referendum. At present, significantly fewer citizens are in favour of leaving the EU than two months ago."
" But hey, isn't that the Danish People's Party's policy for Denmark? And after some observations on the explosive population growth in Africa, he continues: The failure of the EU, and therefore of most EU countries, to deal with the migrant crisis is close to catastrophic. Well, it is precisely the DF's policy to make the EU powerless.So with his criticism Peter Skaarup actually only exposes his and his party's double standards and petty populism."
" But his resignation is on the table until each minister does not focus on their areas of competence avoiding overlaps likely to undermine the credibility of the entire government, Conte recalled, stressing that it is necessary to respect the institutional grammar by speaking clearly about the issues to the president of the council and not launching ambiguous signals in the newspapers. On public accounts, then, the premier asks for himself and the Minister of Economy, Giovanni Tria, the role of dialogue with the EU to avoid an infringement procedure that would hurt us a lot. At this stage League and M5s do not intervene to alter this delicate interlocution. This is the most obvious point of Conte's change of pace, perhaps indigestible for the current majority: The European rules remain in force until we manage to change them, he explained, implying that they must be respected. We have never stopped working, avoiding to respond to controversy and even insults, and the Italians have resonated with us with 9 million votes on Sunday, replied piqued the vice-premier and leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, on his Facebook page."
" But his trip to the Var turned into a fiasco. In the sunshine of Châteaudouble, a small village of 500 inhabitants in the Var that will soon host a centre for asylum seekers with 72 places, the president of the Rassemblement National (RN, ex-Front National) succeeded in denouncing in front of the cameras a migratory flood imposed by the European Union. However, the most memorable aspect of his little escapade was the tense and noisy reception he received."
" But how, according to the crucial question, is this to be done? In view of the fundamental criticism of the EU, there is only one either-or for the AfD: either the EU Parliament, which the AfD describes as undemocratic (the election of which will take place at the end of May 2019), and the majority principle are abolished and the interference of the European Court of Justice in the sovereignty of the nation states is ended. Or else a Dexit, a withdrawal of Germany, or an orderly dissolution of the EU will become necessary - albeit as a last option - in which case the consent of the citizens would have to be obtained, as is a matter of course under our model of direct democracy."
" But if everything is seriously worrying, what happened in the recent European elections is even more so. The cover of The Economist of May 31, which highlights very vividly that the electoral bull of the demagogic groups is throwing a lady who represents the European Union and its projects into the air, is right. From the Spanish Podemos to the anti-European party of Great Britain, the UKID, without forgetting the triumph of Marine Le Pen in France, a new force has emerged within the European Union. I repeat that it is demagogic and that is why it is convenient to remember what Ortega wrote in the Prologue for the French of The Revolt of the Masses, because in this electoral environment, the messages of the demagogues have emerged, based on the fact that the circumstances are difficult. This will be another occasion to prove, unfortunately, what Ortega pointed out, when he wrote that the first condition for an improvement of an important and concrete situation is to be well aware of its enormous difficulty."
" But if the EU were to develop in the direction of a central state with a disempowerment of the member states, a referendum in Austria would be constitutionally mandatory. In the National Council, the FPÖ submitted a motion in January for a (non-binding) referendum on leaving the EU. After a No vote by the British on EU membership in June, would you subsequently also support a vote on EU membership in Austria?"
" But if you look at how the party votes on EU issues, it doesn't seem so sceptical at all. --The Danish People's Party has, under the current government, voted yes to all 23 laws that the EU has asked Denmark to implement. EU The Danish People's Party has voted yes to all EU laws under the current government.Under the previous government, the party voted yes to 22 out of 25 EU laws."
" But in politics, things change, as the recent Giallorossi alliance shows. Antonio Tajani of Forza Italia, the most authoritative Italian among the popular groups and former president of the EU Parliament, says: It is not enough to say that you are Christian to be part of the EPP - he explains - But if the League will share our pro-European positions and in favor of the euro, abandoning the sovereignty that is in contrast with our idea of Europe, then a path can be opened. The conditions are not there today."
 But in the evening another defeat for MEP Meuthen. The AfD voted to leave the EU.And Alice Weidel (42)? It's getting tight for the Meuthen opponent.
" But individual responsibility cannot become an optional extra.* * *We like Marine Le Pen with her 30%. If in Italy the anti-system forces (being anti-system means to be against the EU, its rules and the single currency) would get together, M5S, Lega Nord and FdL would dangerously close to half of the votes, at least according to the polls. Are there perhaps substantial differences between these parties and movements? To us it does not seem so.* *The government decides unilaterally to increase the deficit, openly defying the EU."
" But is it democratic if a narrow majority in one member state can block a project decided by the democratically legitimised governments and parliaments of a Union of 500 million citizens? Anti-EU Campaigns Precisely this kind of initiative would be opened up by the proposals of the ÖVP and FPÖ. Of course, EU-relevant matters could be excluded from such referendums."
" But it is also a bid to save the EU through necessary change. Take the Danish People's Party, the Danish right wing's most outspoken EU sceptics. The DF has largely inspired Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's (V) strong support for David Cameron in the European negotiations - partly in the hope that the British deal could pave the way for restrictions on European immigrants' social rights in Denmark.Now Denmark seems to be able to use planned new provisions that will for the first time allow the downward adjustment of child cheques sent abroad."
" But it is precisely this alliance that the AfD wants. The European candidate Anderson pointed out this contradiction and concluded that meaningful parliamentarism in the EU was hardly feasible because the unified people of the state was missing. Therefore, Anderson said, AfD candidates must keep open the possibility of turning away from the European Parliament: Every MEP must be prepared to saw the branch on which he or she is sitting."
" But it requires political will and diplomatic dexterity - not least from David Cameron himself. If successful, Eurosceptics who, like the Danish People's Party, are now riding on the back of the British, must give their full backing to the British yes to the EU and to Denmark's full participation in cooperation with the British.. bl."
 But it should be a stable government. Where would the FPÖ not compromise? EU policy?We are clearly against more centralism in the EU.
" But it was only because the wall was peeling, the party explains to Corrierre Della Serra. The president's decision quickly triggered condemnation, especially from EU critics.Dansk Folkeparti's foreign affairs spokesman, Søren Espersen, noted that Sergio Matterella's decision enjoyed the backing of French president Macron and the shady EU system. Søren Espersen believes that the president's actions smack of a coup d'état."
" But leadership and political identity are cumbersome obstacles. It is true that FI and Carroccio both criticize the EU. In a different way, however, with a League that focuses on the destruction in tune with the French right wing of Marine Le Pen. Berlusconi, however, even through the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, ventures the mending with the EPP."
" But many people are already scolding her. Her name has been used several times in the speeches of the Europe Écologie-Les Verts, Front de gauche or even FN candidates in the European elections, regularly pilloried as the source of Europe's future ills.It is the Transatlantic Free Trade Area, often referred to by the acronym Tafta (for Transatlantic free trade area), recently abandoned in favour of TTIP (for Transatlantic trade and investment partnership)."
" But no matter how the referendum would have turned out, it exhibits a brevet of incompetence on the part of all those insanely well-paid EU administrators. For years they have been unable to prevent the rise of the many more or less anti-EU movements, such as UKIP, AfD, PVV and the Front National, with valid arguments.. View the original page:"
" But nothing as changeable as Eppink. From the VVD to FvD, for which he becomes an MEP to fight for exit from the EU, to then take the same seat to JA21 who do not want to leave the EU. Nice for those who voted for him."
" But now Farage may have to wipe the smile off his face. EP CHOICE Former friends and fierce opponents criticise DF for group change in the EU.In place of EFD, the 605,889 votes cast for the Danish People's Party in the EP elections over the next five years will be translated into policy through membership of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group. More moderate Eurosceptics from the Conservative ruling party in the UK and the Law and Justice party in Poland, which is not opposed to the EU but sceptical about common regulation, dominate."
" But now that we are in opposition to the current government, which is being driven around by the DF, we have no plans to support them either. But what exactly is the consequence of your guarantee if your wish is not granted? That guarantee means that we will only support a government if it is ready to choose a different path on the points I mention here than the one you get with the current government or through cooperation with the DF.We can't wait for all EU member states to agree Mattias Tesfaye (S).0"
" But of course this is taboo. Criticism of the EU and the euro, as we know, was the AfD's original political soup. In committee, the parliamentary group is conspicuous for its unusually long speeches."
" But on Sunday the Italians gave me a mandate to go and recontract these rules that are harmful, Salvini replied. He will not go there in person and neither will the sovereignists who have not broken through at the European elections, apart from the electoral success of the League and the Rassemblement National of Marine Le Pen: in the Strasbourg Parliament they count only about seventy MEPs and are out of the games of the new majority that is emerging between Popular, Socialists and Liberals of the Alde where the French of Emmanuel Macron will sit. Certainly, if the baton of command is now held by the vice-premier of the League, to whom Di Maio is forced to say so many yeses, then it will soon become clear which direction the government will take."
" But opinions among the EU states differ just as much as they do in Austria about what should change. Neos and Greens want a European federal state, SPÖ a social union, FPÖ the dismantling of the EU and ÖVP see above. France, Germany and Poland are similarly divided."
" But she warns that the decision does not clear up doubts about working citizens from other member states and their social rights. It does not provide answers to the challenges that Denmark faces in relation to, for example, the payment of child benefits to EU citizens, says Tørnæs.Dansk Folkeparti's Morten Messerschmidt is pleased that the madness has a limit after all, as he says.At the same time, however, the DF says it is crucial that the government now does everything that can possibly be done to ensure that all Danish welfare services are also defended - just like the German ones."
" But that does not (yet) exist. The AfD serves both the prudent, realpolitik euro critics and those who don't like the EU and want a fortress Germany.This is understandable, because new parties that say no always attract a lot of political ghost riders - in retrospect, the Greens can sing an ugly' song about this."
" But that is the reality, and therefore I hope that the negotiations can be conducted in a checked and business-oriented way, said Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen at the press conference, according to Ritzau. -- The Danish People's Party, the government's support party, is far from impressed with the Danish line in the Brexit negotiations.EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth is disappointed that Lars Løkkes talks with colleagues from the Netherlands and Ireland in his opinion do not lead to a softer Brexit course. It is generally a little unclear how the meetings Løkke has had have affected the government's basis for negotiations."
" But that requires that the person is already an alternate, says Søndergaard, who acknowledges that it is difficult to find a willing and not least suitable candidate for the top post. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS DF criticises the fact that the People's Movement against the EU's Søren Søndergaard has offered to resign early in order to create a platform for a new leading candidate. I think it's an uphill battle for all parties to find well-known leadership candidates, because there's been a tendency for it to be a kind of rush job."
" But that's not all, because in Faraone's sights there is also the measure that replaced the Rome-saver: On the Milleproroghe: new prefects are appointed, brought to 207 when the prefectures are half, 400 million are granted to Rome when all the municipalities are suffering. Two excellent measures to give breath to the tired trumpets of the League. And then the EU money parceled out for the South and for work on a thousand measures without any strategy. Or even the exemptions to the Stability Pact for non-virtuous municipalities, which ask to stabilize the workers even where it exceeds the organic plant and nothing for virtuous municipalities who want to carry out useful works for the community."
" But the EU is using up all its resources for a handful of people who have the physical and financial means to travel to Europe via smuggling gangs. As is well known, combating this form of illegal migration is one of the priorities of the Austrian EU Presidency. Now, a seven-point plan, which Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) presented yesterday (Thursday) together with the Danish Integration Minister Inger Stöjberg (she belongs to the conservative-liberal governing party Venstre) and Collier on the fringes of a conference of the European Migration Network, is to set clear milestones for a better protection system. It is a practical-ethical approach, according to Kickl, who considers the current EU migration system to be the most inhumane ever."
" But the delivery of solutions may be made more difficult by the fact that voters are drifting away from the parties that have so far led the Member States. In Denmark, the Danish People's Party became the largest bourgeois party in the last parliamentary elections. In France, anti-EU Marine Le Pen could win the presidential election this year. In the Netherlands, anti-EU sentiment is strong and in Germany, Angela Merkel could lose power this year."
" But the government seems to be outnumbered. Both Enhedslisten, Dansk Folkeparti, Venstre and Liberal Alliance have refused to support a snus ban.It is crazy that the EU wants to ban snus - and that the government does not put its foot down. The experience from Sweden shows that people are switching from smoking tobacco to snus, Joachim B."
" But the internal market consists first and foremost of all the rules that the Danish People's Party has a party to ridicule, and of the institutions that must ensure that the individual countries respect the rules that we have agreed together. In short, it makes no sense to celebrate the single market if you do not also support the common rules and the EU institutions.Like the Danish People's Party, the Greens have proposed a Danish welfare and labour market opt-out in line with the four existing reservations. Neither party takes a position on the fact that a very large part of Danish welfare and Danish jobs are due to the open European market."
" But the mood for leaving was never that strong in our country. The only good thing about it now is that the British vote has given some 450 million other EU residents food for thought as to whether leaving would be wise. But this flirting, the flirting of the FPÖ, that alone is damaging the economy.Standard:"
" But the move is also tactical. The bourgeois parties do not want their domestic policy positions to be neutralised by a general EU positivity, as this leaves large political platforms to the pure Eurosceptic parties. Which the Danish People's Party has successfully exploited here in the run-up to the 25 May parliamentary elections.The Left and Conservatives do not want this bleeding to the DF to continue and therefore also the more skeptical line."
" But the path ahead is certainly not an easy one. The League must succeed in transforming itself from an exclusively populist party, dedicated to fighting the European Union and immigration, into a conservative and eurorormist party. This means accepting the presence of the European institutions, even though it wants to radically change them. In other words, recognize the legitimacy of the EU, ending the phase of complete aversion."
" But the problem is that the moment you give up sovereignty, we have a very principled position that citizens should be consulted, says Adelsteen. EU spokesperson Lykke Friis points out that in 2006 the Danish People's Party was in favour of giving more power to the EU on patents. Despite the fact that there was a surrender of sovereignty, they said, 'Okay, that's fine, there's not going to be a referendum.'"
" But the procrastination across the Channel on leaving the EU has dampened some spirits. This is an unprecedented situation, which will have designated these 2019 European elections as an edition in which membership of the EU will finally have caused little debate. Contrary to 2014, neither the Rassemblement National nor Debout la France are defending an exit from the common space. As for the die-hard critics of the Union, it is largely marginalised from the public debate that they conclude their campaign."
" But the reality is that, when she is in the European Parliament, she is a slavish supporter in all circumstances of this federalist European construction which aims at the disappearance of nations,"" Le Pen said on RTL. LR president Laurent Wauquiez says that Emmanuel Macron is the symbol of the one who wants to spread migrants all over Europe but LR MEPs voted in Strasbourg for a provision to settle migrants all over Europe, the RN leader detailed.Accused of undermining the fundamental values of the EU and targeted in this regard by an unprecedented procedure in the European Parliament, the Hungarian national-conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, member of the EPP group, denounced Tuesday in Strasbourg any blackmail aimed at making him deviate from his intransigent position on migrants.Marine Le Pen said there was much she disagreed with in the report by MEP Judith Sargentini (Greens), which set out a long list of concerns about Hungary's disregard for the freedoms and values promoted by the EU."
" But the red and black losses on the border with Hungary only look less dramatic in comparison to the Styrian earthquake. Zwar governor Hans Niessl has also called for border controls, but in a less anti-EU way than the FPÖ, which is calling for a permanent border guard, although statistically the lowest crime rate in Austria was registered between Neusiedl and Güssing. Many say that these are the positive effects of the assistance mission of the Austrian Armed Forces, which has been abolished in the meantime."
" But the reforms that have been put in place we do not believe will be reversed. If that is their intention, we will explain to them why it is a bad idea, says a senior Commission source.So if Podemos governs, and as long as it wants Spain to remain in the EU and the euro, its hands are tied in many areas. And more and more."
" But the surrender of sovereignty is the same, says Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, member of the European Affairs Committee for the Left. The conservative EU spokesperson, Lene Espersen, is also out with a vengeance.I think the Danish People's Party is showing an extreme degree of hypocrisy. It's strange that once you say yes to giving up sovereignty, and now suddenly you don't want to."
" But their essential message was different: One had to reject efforts to rely on a repressive surveillance state as a consequence. She also spoke out against agitators against refugees and those who were pushing for the disintegration of the EU, specifically naming FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache. Refugees are by no means invaders on behalf of IS, Glawischnig stressed."
" But there is no doubt that Europe has also moved a lot. Your party leader, Anders Samuelsen, has previously said that you are actually more Eurosceptic than the Danish People's Party. Are you proud of that position? We are proud that we have the policy we have.And that we have the same approach to the EU as to Danish politics: that when the powers that be once again come and make stupid rules, we are the ones who fight back."
" But there is still the other camp, for whom Strache is evil personified and a red-blue coalition would be a reason to leave the party. A camp that does not want to trust the FPÖ's assurances that it is not in favour of leaving the EU anyway. Which cannot and will not accept the recurring individual cases of FPÖ functionaries who straddle the extreme right-wing fringe."
" But these two electorates are more likely to end up arguing over increasingly scarce resources than inventing a new socioeconomic paradigm. Fiscal expansion is not sustainable, not because of EU rules or institutional limits, but because of Italy's fragile fiscal outlook. The League's electorate remains in the industrial North, although thanks to the immigration issue it has gained votes in the South for the first time. M5S has a more national base, but its support is rooted in the South."
" But this is no longer a priority. The big bang that was proposed on the exit from the euro in a brutal way (during the presidential elections, editor's note) created a lot of concern among the French, explains the spokesman, also a member of the national bureau (enlarged leadership) of the RN.This kind of institutional big bang on the euro and the EU, was proposed in a period when we were relatively isolated on the European scene, he argues.And he said: Today, the arrival in power of our sovereignist allies throughout Europe has made things happen."
" But this is one-dimensional thinking, and it comes from people who themselves feel that they do not benefit from freedom of movement. Instead of explaining the advantages to them, instead of reminding them of the youth who can study or gain professional experience in any EU country, FPÖ Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache promotes this one-dimensionality with his demand to restrict the free movement of labour migrants from the East. Workers from EU countries can lead to distortions if they force nationals out of the labour market in too many cases."
" But three major European economies still put this Europhobic current in the lead: the United Kingdom, where Nigel Farage's Brexit party reached 31.7% of the vote, Italy, where the League came first (34.3%) as did the Rassemblement National (RN) in France (23.3%). The question for European national-populists is whether they want to join forces with the European Parliament. And there is no obvious answer. The French RN, the Italian League, the German AfD, the Austrian FPö, the True Finns Party, the Belgians of Vlaams Belang and other European formations intend to form a large group in Brussels and Strasbourg. At present, such a group would have about 80 members."
" But to do so, it is excessive to affirm that they want power to return to the streets and that it is the people, with their vote, who decide whether or not they want to change this constitutional framework. This must be so in any case, which requires something that Podemos does not include in its Program, the reform of Article 167 of the Constitution, in order to radically exclude the possibility of the reform imposed by the PP Government, with the support of the PSOE, to submit Spain to the dictates of the austerity policies of the European Union.We respect and, to a large extent, share the program of Podemos, but the 20.66% of the votes obtained obliges it to yield, to reconcile and widen the spaces of understanding and to forge or support a Government with the party or parties with which it has the greatest coincidences. Then we will be truly opening a new stage."
" But unlike a normal referendum, Wilders has no intention of acquiescing if any majority votes against his ideas. We will continue regardless. The PVV is completely done with the EU, according to Hún Brussel, óns Nederland, which is actually more of a declaration of independence than an election program, Wilders believes. The Netherlands should leave the EU, stop using the euro and remove the European flag from Dutch government buildings."
" But we also feel guaranteed by the authoritativeness of Prime Minister Draghi, who we count on to have verified and, if necessary, improved the contents of the treaty. Is the difference in attitude between FI and FdI and Lega due to a different approach towards the EU, to their difficulty in ceding shares of sovereignty? Parliaments will also be called upon to collaborate. They are known to have a greater distrust of the idea of Europe working for the good of the citizens of different states."
" But we are not in the same situation, said the leader of the French radical left in an interview with EL PAÍS. In the European left, there are Euro-critics like Syriza or Podemos, who want to reform the EU, and Eurosceptics like La Francia Insumisa, explains Héctor Sánchez Margalef, researcher at Cidob. The key, he adds, will be to see who will take the reins of the parliamentary group to observe the direction the group takes."
" But we have to put the possibility of a Dexit on the table so that there are reforms, as Cameron has done. The AfD election manifesto states that a Dexit is necessary if the EU cannot be reformed in a reasonable time. How much time is appropriate?"
" But we will not hear his name again in the future. The anti-EU, anti-immigration and anti-globalisation slogans (of the FPÖ) are all the more so.Newspaper : Delo"
" But what exactly does Denmark need a British no for? DF counting on goodbye to Cameron Denmark's largest Eurosceptic party no longer identifies with Nigel Farage & Co, even though Morten Messerschmidt shared a group with Ukip in the European Parliament until the 2014 elections. Today, the DFs instead sit in a group led by the British Conservatives, who are deeply divided on the issue of the EU and whose scepticism is more pragmatic.Thulesen Dahl's change of course is, by all accounts, due to the DF top's study trips to Britain having convinced them that David Cameron will resign after a no vote and leave Downing Street no. 10 to former London Mayor Boris Johnson or another leading naysayer from the Conservative Party."
" But what if it doesn't? Analyses on the possible effects of a Grexit have focused on the future of the euro, but the political consequences risk going beyond an economic picture that is problematic in itself. Those who think that a Europe without Greece could recover greater cohesion are wrong: a Grexit would exacerbate tensions within the eurozone, put the entire integration process in crisis, and provide a formidable assist to those - from Podemos in Spain, to Syriza, to Alternative fur Deutschland in Germany, to the League, to Ukip in Britain, to groups in the Netherlands and Finland - who are riding the wave of skepticism about European institutions sick with bureaucratism, to contest the euro and in some cases call for the dissolution of the EU. They forget that it is thanks to the European Community first, and then to the Union, that for 60 years the continent has been living a season of freedom and well-being never known before."
" But what is the difference? In recent weeks, Stronach has been increasingly quiet on the issue - because the euro has probably not turned out to be the campaign hit it looked like before. Even the FPÖ and BZÖ were very quiet on the euro and EU issues during the election campaign. Stronach's new reticence is also surprising because the issue of the common currency can certainly be counted among the core competence of the economy - to which the billionaire likes to refer."
" But when a majority of voters rejected the opt-in, that plan fell apart. Instead, the Japanese parties, with the exception of the SF, together with the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance, agreed that Denmark should go for three parallel agreements. In Brussels, the Danish diplomacy should, in addition to an agreement on Europol, focus on an agreement on the air passenger register and Eurojust.After several months of negotiations, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V) was able to inform the party leaders in Parliament on Thursday that he had an offer for a special agreement on Europol."
" But when you're under fire, you can blow a fuse, as he said: So yes, call it rash, but sorry: I'm not a robot, I'm a human being like everyone else. However, BT's editorial writer still found his statements embarrassingly disappointing: The Danish People's Party has just voted against the EU and the centralisation of power, after which the big vote winner in the EU elections chooses to blame Rikke Karlsson's lack of understanding of how the smart ones manage in Europe's capital.--and thus indicates that he is just part of the pairing after years in Brussels."
" But you also have to show that Does the impression that the FPÖ is not calling for an EU exit so that it can continue to make its mark in domestic politics at the expense of the Union?This is not about tactical antics, but about something of principle: I vigorously oppose a politically correct dictatorship of opinion creating a centralist entity with countless moronic regulations in which Europe's diversity is drowned."
" But, at the end of the Eurogroup, he would not comment specifically on the possible effects of a strong investment push in Italy already included in the Def in April. Italy was not on the agenda, premised Portuguese Eurogroup President Mario Centeno, downplaying the critical intervention of Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, who called the compromise between the M5S-Lega government and the EU Commission on the 2019 maneuver not sufficiently convincing. Centeno recalled the doubts of three years ago about my Portugal, which has since achieved excellent results in relaunching the economy."
" By a majority of almost two to one, our TDs backed a policy which, if implemented, would undermine the basis of our prosperity. What was most striking about the vote against the EU trade deal with South America was not the stance of Sinn Féin and the hard left, who oppose free trade deals as a matter of principle, but the spinelessness of so many mainstream politicians who either didn't understand the fundamental principle at stake or, even worse, didn't have the courage to defend it. The whole performance raises worrying questions about how the political system will respond to the next serious crisis that hits this country."
" By openly welcoming Marine Le Pen to the Binnenhof, he is sending a clear message: this European cooperation is worth a lot to him. This newspaper asked the PVV about its reasons for inviting Marine Le Pen to The Hague, about the other European parties Wilders has contact with, and about its plans to form a large anti-Europe faction. Yesterday afternoon, despite repeated requests, there had been no response."
 CDA: raise age limit for sale of alcohol and tobacco to eighteen. PVV: Netherlands out of the EU. SP: not to pay fine to Europe when budget deficit exceeds 3%.
" CSU loses dramatically in Bavaria. Higher voter turnout than in 2009. Far-right Front National becomes strongest party in France The SPD has made significant gains in the European elections in Germany and is hoping to become the new President of the EU Commission. At the same time, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) managed around seven percent from a standing start and enters parliament for the first time.Despite losses, the Union remained the strongest force with more than 35 percent, which was, however, its worst result in a European election so far."
" Cameron has led the most anti-EU government in Britain since Margaret Thatcher's in the 1980s. His party has allied itself in the EU Parliament with parties that are strongly critical of the EU, including the Danish People's Party, the right-wing Catholic Polish ruling party PiS and the xenophobic Alternative for Germany. A British no is on the cards."
" Can it be done after the vote? Yes, that is the question. I would certainly encourage the government to interpret a divided population as not having support for bringing Denmark into the core of the EU, says Thulesen Dahl.He refers to the fact that the Left, the Danish Liberal Democrats, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives agreed on a common course in EU policy during the election campaign.With a written declaration printed as advertisements in the country's newspapers, the four parties gave each other the go-ahead for a new bourgeois government to support the EU scepticism advocated by Britain, among others."
" Certainly, for Salvini for the remain have voted the rich (the under 24, all millionaires?), while the people have chosen isolation, hoping that it is also splendid. Meanwhile, the League continues on its way. The Italian way to Brexit, promises Salvini, starts tomorrow (today for those who read, ed.) from Parma, at the convention listening to the real country: We rebuild. But it's another verb that's not really a wrecking ball."
" Chagrin over the European Union is widely felt in Dutch politics, but a member state's departure from the EU was thought to be impossible. It is ominous, especially for middle parties VVD, PvdA, CDA and D66. A Nexit, as proposed by PVV leader Geert Wilders, is out of sight. The other major parties consider canceling EU membership many bridges too far. The chaos that has ensued in the United Kingdom only reinforces their belief that such an experiment should not be repeated here."
" Chancellor Christian Kern expresses concern in the circle of his EU counterparts about a possible participation of the FPÖ in government after the National Council elections. It is considered blatantly anti-European, the SPÖ politician told journalists in Tallinn on Friday when asked if he had been approached about the FPÖ at the EU summit. You have that as a concern, of course, Kern said."
" Chancellor: EU leaders worried about FPÖ government participation. In Brussels, the Freedom Party is considered blatantly anti-European, Kern said."
" Classical media play a secondary role. The news of Karas' candidacy broke just as the FPÖ was holding its New Year's meeting in Vienna, where it also launched its EU election campaign. Karas had declared that he wanted to fight in the election campaign against the anti-EU populists who want to destroy Europe and that he wanted to stand up for more cohesion instead of nationalism."
" Comment The FPÖ's international world view Detour profitability is not necessarily the word that plays a big role in the language used by FPÖ politicians. That is why the EU net contribution is also readily viewed in isolation from participation in the EU's internal market. Therefore, the FPÖ negates the fact that foreign workers contribute to the country's economic performance as well as to social security."
" Conflicts today are no longer national-military, but international-digital, Karas said. Leitl also spoke out in favour of more international cooperation and criticised the FPÖ's EU election campaign: ""I am at an age where you can get to the heart of things. The future of Europe is not about what Mr Vilimsky says, who thinks Europe needs less cooperation."
" Congratulations to the coalition of @matteosalvini and the League who finally form the new Italian government. This is a victory for democracy over the intimidation and threats of the European Union. Nothing will prevent the return of the people to the stage of history!The FN deputy for the Gard, Gilbert Collard, hailed on franceinfo a very central political experience."
" Consequently, member states are doing plenty of that. This is also true for Dutch politics: each party sees in the agreement on the European multiannual budget and the recovery fund a confirmation of its own view of the European Union. PVV leader Wilders immediately tweeted madness, Forum for Democracy needed a little more words for the same statement, and the SP and SGP were also critical. D66 sees it as an encouraging step towards a federal Europe: Today a great leap forward in European integration, jubilated group leader Jetten."
" Consequently, this Union for many young people is some ossified creation that is far away and, importantly, that they do not understand. They have also succeeded in building the image of the EU as one that carries all western ideologies: LGBT, abortion, gender. Politicians of the Law and Justice party and the national movements have succeeded in convincing young people that the main goal of the EU is to make everyone homosexual and that this is what the EU is mainly associated with by young people with conservative views.Can such high support for Bosak and Konfederacja augur that in a few years Poland will be ruled by the extreme right?"
" Conte explained that on citizenship income and quota 100 there are no changes neither in the audience, nor in the number of interventions. In light of the technical estimates, concluded the Prime Minister, justifying the shift from 2.4% to 2.04 in the deficit/GDP ratio, a revision of the final balance has been duly imposed because resources have been recovered and some interventions have been refined, but which fully respect the reform project both in terms of the number of recipients of the measures and for the interventions made available as well as for the timing While Conte and Giovanni Tria negotiate the agreement with the EU, the tension between M5s and Lega on the measures of the maneuver continues. It will be reformulated, sources of the League know, the amendment on cutting golden pensions, presented in the Senate by the group leader M5s Stefano Patuanelli."
" Conte reported that the dialogue with the president of the Eurogroup was constructive and serene. Centeno, in half an hour of confidential two-way dialogue with Tria, verified the margins of political compromise between Italy and the EU. The Eurogroup is asking the M5S-Lega government to negotiate as much budgetary flexibility as possible - like the many others that ended up in excessive deficit proceedings - without, however, challenging the principle that EU rules must be respected. Some initial signs are there."

" Contrary to what his fiercest critics say, Kaczynski is not at all assuming a polexit. He is aware of the benefits Poland has gained, including under the PiS government, from its presence in the EU. But he will only step back when that Union sword of Damocles is flying at his head."
" Control must remain with the nation states, there must be no setting back of the sovereignty of the individual countries, he says. This is a good basis for the failure of a common protection of the EU's external borders.The FPÖ thrives on problems, not on solving them. Without problems, there would be no one to blame, and that is a cornerstone of liberal politics."
" Control of currency, borders, and agriculture. Those who ally themselves with the League must be clear that we will make a last attempt to change the rules of the EU. But if that doesn't work, we're ready to get out of it and start counting again."
" Conversely, the AK under Tumpel was criticised for steering too much in the red. Tumpel made himself vulnerable by saying no to the opening of the labour market to the East, which was in line with the FPÖ."
" Cota, Fassino and Saitta are ready to receive them, but the reopening of the confrontation can take place only if we don't talk about Yes Tav or No Tav, but we discuss how to best implement the decisions confirmed by the government. . And Cota, newly re-elected secretary of the Piedmont League, attacks: Nobody thinks that the money allocated by the European Union is wasted or spent on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria or the bridge over the Strait.0"
" Craftsmen and software entrepreneurs are there, owners of metal and construction companies - classic German SMEs. The AfD has always attracted them: The party leadership around the economics professors Bernd Lucke and Joachim Starbatty promised economic expertise, their clear edge against Brussels stroked the souls of entrepreneurs, who had become unaffected by bureaucratic Together they wanted to fill a gap in the party spectrum: where those entrepreneurs who no longer felt understood by the CDU and FDP were addressed."
" Crisis of acute euroscepticism in the UMP The polls still show the National Front in the lead in the next European elections, and it shows. The leaders of the UMP are not done with the war of the leaders, even behind the screen of the debate of ideas, and it shows."
" Criticism of Gudenus appearance The speech by Viennese FPÖ club leader Johann Gudenus in Moscow, in which he criticised EU policy towards Russia and railed against an alleged homosexual lobby, has provoked sharp criticism. Gudenus was undermining joint efforts for a peaceful solution in the Ukraine conflict, the SPÖ criticised."
" Criticism of the results of the EU special summit on the refugee issue abounded yesterday, Friday. While the current EU plans did not go far enough for the aid organisations, the FPÖ, for example, emphasised that African asylum problems had to be solved on their own continent. As reported, the EU heads of state and government had agreed on Thursday to triple the funding for the EU missions Triton and Poseidon."
" D. Are we at the turning point of the League? From the sovereignist group in Europe, with Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement national, to the Popular group with Angela Merkel's Cdu? We are at the beginning of a movement that in time could mark a turning point."
" D66 in particular is an enthusiastic advocate of a federal Europe. Others see this new EU project as a totalitarian power grab by Brussels to wring the neck of national sovereignty. The PVV in particular is mordantly opposed. Other parties, such as the CDA and the VVD and PvdA, do not take a clear position."
" DENMARK AND THE EU Growing EU scepticism in Europe strengthens the Danish People's Party, but if it leads Britain out of the EU, it also gives the party a problem. Now, however, the British may be going where the DF has set the limit in relation to the EU. Where scepticism turns into outright opposition.The Danish People's Party has always had fighting more EU as an absolute key issue.On the other hand, it has been far less clear what the party itself actually wants from EU membership."
" Dangerous! Proposal of EU referendum--Nothing is too crazy for FvD, it seems'EU Parliament turns heel' (AD 24-7)."
" Danish People's Party MEP Morten Messerschmidt announced to Politiken on Sunday that the acting prime minister will use the trip to Brussels to establish that there is a new Danish government on the way, which is expected to be sympathetic to the British point of view. Morten Messerschmidt therefore expected Thorning to bring the EU paper that the four bourgeois parties, Venstre, Dansk Folkeparti, Liberal Alliance and Conservatives, drew up together during the election campaign, in which they emphasised that they would fight, together with the UK, against the EU becoming a social union in which EU citizens could receive unlimited welfare benefits in all EU countries.However, the chair of the European Affairs Committee, Eva Kjer Hansen (V), felt that it was more appropriate for the future prime minister to present the new government's policy, and when Lars Løkke Rasmussen came out of the meeting with the acting prime minister today, he emphasised that the prime minister had just stressed that she would keep a low profile at the meeting."
 Danish bourgeois parties reject Herman Van Rompuy: There is a problem with social benefits for EU citizens. The foreign minister is on the side of the EU president.But party chair Kristian Thulesen Dahl (DF) says with biting irony that the EU president deserves an award for his timely diligence in the EU debate. He comes in the middle of the European election campaign and acts like an elephant in a glass shop.
" Debout la France thus belongs to a real network of 23 political parties, moderate Eurosceptics, the third force in the Parliament. By voting for our candidates, the voters will have the certainty of having a real influence, much more so than isolated RN deputies.A moderate eurosceptic, you who promise to dynamite the European Commission from the inside?Yes, moderate because I want to rebuild Europe by suppressing this Brussels Commission which has disfigured it, not leave it completely. Besides, why should we have no choice but to suffer it or leave? France is at the heart of Europe, we just have to reshape it to suit our interests."
" Delinquent refugees: Brussels ready to decide on rapid deportation EU asylum law. Since June 2018, a tightening of deportation rules has been ready for decision, which the ÖVP and FPÖ are now demanding.Brussels."
" Denmark. The EU unit has been criticised by MP Marie Krarup (DF), among others, while Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen (LA) stated during a hearing in the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee in December that Russia is using misinformation to seek to obstruct a democratic debate based on facts and objectivity and is using myths and lies that can and must be torn apart.And the East StratCom Task Force contributes to that."
" Destroy Europe from within was the goal announced by anti-system forces after their success in the elections last May 25. The program soon turned out to be less feasible than expected for the parties that remained outside the political groups of the hemicycle, a galaxy ranging from the French nationalist right Front National to the first neo-Nazi German MEP Udo Voigt, from the Hungarian extremists of Jobbik to the Northern League: without alliances, the populists have lost weight and ability to affect EU policies, but multiplied their efforts to attract attention. Thus in the Strasbourg plenary session, the 71-year-old mathematician Janusz Korwin-Mikke, leader of the Congress of the new Polish right, did not hesitate to use the English term nigger several times in a speech on young unemployed slaves of the 21st century, and then explained candidly: In my country it is not a derogatory word, even John Lennon used it."
" Directional dispute in the FPÖ over the attitude to the EU Öxit. Austria should not speculate on leaving the EU, warns Manfred Haimbuchner, leader of the FPÖ in Upper Austria, distancing himself from federal party leader Heinz-Christian Strache. Linz/Innsbruck."
" Dissatisfaction with the Union has spread across virtually the entire continent of Europe. In the eyes of millions of people, the EU is an insatiable glutton that appropriates more and more power. Thus, the picture painted by the PVV and Front National, a monster that enslaves member states, finds widespread support. It is up to the proponents of the Union to parry this presentation."
" Do members of the opposition criticize the reform of the judiciary or Polish foreign policy? Make them look like Targowica working for Germany (not for Russia, as it used to be) and the case will be closed. The Law and Justice party demands that Polish interests in the EU be taken into account to a greater extent and thus is pursuing a partially confrontational course towards the biggest powers. It will say that it is taking Poland out of the EU, which is in Putin's interest - and the debate is over. Are you criticizing LGBT expansion? These will form an alliance with Putin, because Putin is the one who creates value."
 Do not leave key ministries to the FPÖ! Call: Austria must remain a reliable partner in the EU Dvoters have decided. The ÖVP was elected the party with the largest number of votes and mandates in Austria.
" Do we ourselves also have to abide by the requirement of a budget deficit of no more than 3%, which Brussels, under strong pressure from the Netherlands and Germany, has imposed on the poor members of the euro zone? This seems to me an eminently political question, to which different parties will give different answers. The new five-party coalition does want to and PvdA, SP and PVV do not want to abide by the European 3% rule.The European Union was traditionally a project of a small idealistic elite of Europeans who had deliberately formulated their dream of European unity in economic terms. The European Community was initially one of Coal and Steel (ECSC 1952)."
" Do you know what a difference is between Switzerland and the Netherlands? They have direct democracy and binding referendums there. Less immigration, less EU and much more confidence in politics.' Baudet vs. Rutte IslamBaudet (FvD): 'The prime minister just said: the word teacher shortage is not in the coalition agreement, nor is the word Islam, but we are going to work on the teacher shortage. So is the prime minister going to deal with Islam as well or did I misunderstand that?"
" Does she not manage to communicate clearly? The constant discussion about which party could demand EU exit as the last measure is something we wouldn't have if the EU itself hadn't often broken treaties.Wouldn't the FPÖ also end the discussion if it said: We brought this into play earlier, but now things have changed?We did not bring it into play."
" Don't close any chapters and don't open any new ones, says the German coalition agreement of SPD and CDU/CSU. Visa liberalisation or an expansion of the Customs Union is only possible when Turkey fulfils the necessary conditions. The government programme of the ÖVP and FPÖ is even clearer: no consent to Turkey joining the EU. Allies are being sought to achieve the final termination of the EU accession negotiations in favour of a European-Turkish neighbourhood concept. The Dutch government agreement also speaks only of a new relationship towards Ankara."
" Don't know? Don't show LETTERS AS WE approach the latest referendum for greater EU integration, its opponents, such as Sinn Féin, will give voice, as in the past, to the dishonest slogan: 'If you don't know, vote No.'If undecided how to vote, it's more honourable to abstain than to vote neither yes or no."
" Don't you think pan-European lists make it easier to focus on substance? No, I actually think it's the other way around. The People's Movement against the EU and the Danish People's Party will thunder against it and say: 'There you see, there will be even more EU'. It is true that there is a lot of 'for and against' discussion in Denmark, but there is less now than there has been - if you look at the support of the opposition."
" Dropping to 4.08 % in the 2013 elections, this year in the European elections, led by Salvini, it reached 6.16. And the current polls see it growing (they talk about 9 %). Why? Extremist and unrestrained, Salvini has not changed his method: exasperated and sometimes unprovoked attacks, by means of an aggressive and heavy language, on the traditional targets of the League: Roman centralism and southern welfare, tax robbery, extra-community, European Union and euro currency. However, if you look closely underneath these trade shenanigans, it's not hard to see that Salvini is cleverly enunciating a new method of presence and conquest for his party.He proposes to reduce some of our country's greatest ills."
" During his meeting with Serbian President Tomislav Nikoli, the refugee crisis also came up. According to Serbian media, Hofer proposed to create a zone in North Africa where asylum in the EU would be decided. The connection between the FPÖ and Nikoli dates back to the time when Nikoli was head of the Serbian Radical Party. Today, the nationalist is considered the pro-Russian part of the ruling Progressive Party."

" During the 80 minutes allocated to the Free Debate, one has to look far for critical objections to the party line. The common denominator of the speeches is harsh criticism of the EU, Eastern workers, immigration and not least halal food in day-care centres.Dansk Folkeparti's Youth Chairman, Anders Vistisen, draws great applause when he performs a kind of stand-up show in his speech, in which he ironises about the population explosion and the causes of poverty in Egypt. He concludes by proposing an end to development aid."
" During the short period of the short government, the ÖVP has become more and more similar to the FPÖ. There are people who claim that the ÖVP is disenchanting the FPÖ . A look at the rhetoric of the ÖVP in the EU election campaign makes it clear: it is exactly the other way round.--one has to ask: What is bourgeois about the majority? The right-wing populist, anti-European policies of the ÖVP, the undermining of democracy and freedom of the press lack any bourgeois programme."
" EP-VALG Several S candidates for the European Parliament blame the Prime Minister for ignoring the EU elections in her May Day speeches. According to him, the pro-EU parties are thus leaving the field to the leaders of the no parties in the Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten and Liberal Alliance, who in turn often use national parliamentary speeches and other political platforms to talk thunder about, for example, welfare tourism in the EU. The consequence, says the MEP, is that we are moving towards the UK, where there is a really negative mood about the EU."
" EU AGREEMENT It will not take a new general election to see the Danish People's Party in government if the party can agree with the Left on a common EU line after the referendum, says the DF leader. -- But if a majority of voters votes against transforming the legal reservation into an opt-in system, it may be easier for the Danish People's Party and the Left to agree on Denmark's relationship with the EU, the DF leader estimates.At the moment, he finds it difficult to see any indications that the Left is changing course in a way that would bring the two parties seriously close to each other."
" EU Exit? Must be discussed Interview. Dominik Nepp, party leader of the FPÖ Vienna, initiates an EU exit debate. Despite a series of blue scandals, he wants up to 20 per cent in the Vienna election."
" EU Policy: Into the Future with the Retro-Gang None can deny that the FPÖ has shown an independent foreign and European policy profile in recent years. She repeatedly flirted with the Öxit and the unwinding of the Eurozone, fraternised with Le Pen and Wilders in the joint group in the European Parliament and supported the Visegrád states in refusing to accept refugees."
" EU SKEPSIS In a rare interview, the Secretary General of the EU Council of Ministers, Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, warns that further gains for anti-EU parties will weaken Europe's ability to solve today's biggest crises. It is completely misunderstood, says the Danish People's Party.In a major interview in today's PS, Tranholm-Mikkelsen gives a rare insight into how the top in Brussels views the wave of popular scepticism towards cooperation that has washed over Europe in recent years.The EU leadership is aware of a real crisis of confidence, which is not only European but could have dramatic consequences for Europe, says Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen."
" EU STANDARD Enhedslisten seems to be caught by the old DKP-view, which also prevails in the People's Movement against the EU (and in DF), that the national sovereignty is inviolable, and that the Danish state must not be bound by a European cooperation, but must be free to choose its cooperation partners all over the world (which you can also do as a member of the EU). Denmark should be expelled from the EU, says Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen (Pol."
" EU The Left rules out the Danish People's Party in a bourgeois government, but the DF believes that disagreements on EU policy are manageable. The British can handle having a government with a Eurosceptic party that has views similar to those of the Danish People's Party and a liberal party that is pro-EU.Sure you can handle it if you want to."
" EU election campaign launched FPÖ and SPÖ critical of ÖVP top candidate Karas Vienna Othmar Karas as the ÖVP's top candidate for the EU election campaign is a challenge not only for the EU-critical coalition partner FPÖ, but also for the opposition SPÖ."
" EU partners delighted about Austria, worried about Italy Brussels fears with Am evening still joy and relief about the election victory of the EU-friendly Alexander Van der Bellen in Austria, then shortly after midnight disillusionment when news came from Rome that Italy's prime minister had been elected. Both events were considered very important because of their possible consequences for the entire Union, as a gauge of whether or not the EU sceptics such as the FPÖ will gain further momentum after Brexit in June. Regarding Austria, the German Chancellor said"
" EU party funding: FPÖ fears cancellation FPÖ MEPs Andreas Mölzer and Franz Obermayer criticise a review of party funding for non-attached mandataries in the EU Parliament initiated by Socialist Group Leader Hannes Swoboda. It cannot be a punishable offence to say we want less Europe, Obermayer said."
" EU policy as a hurdle to coalition ÖVP insists on clear pro-European stance of FPÖ Beven before the official start of talks between ÖVP and FPÖ on the content of a cooperation, it is becoming apparent that European policy could be one of the major stumbling blocks in the formation of a government. The line of a pro-European government set by ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz means that there must be an agreement with a partner that Austria must not be weakened in Europe , said the head of the ÖVP delegation in the EU Parliament, Othmar Karas, in Strasbourg on Tuesday."
" EU private sector investments have allowed Poland to significantly change its position on international markets, raise the technological level, wages and employment, which has changed the face of our economy. Minister Kowalski's omission of these facts can be interpreted as a politically motivated encouragement of Polish voters to change their - now overwhelmingly positive - assessment of the EU, i.e. to encourage polexit.The leadership of the Law and Justice Party and the Agreements, including the Prime Minister of the government, stress at every opportunity that accusing them of seeking to take Poland out of the EU is a misunderstanding, perhaps even a political instrument of the opposition in the struggle for power. Minister Kowalski is providing an opportunity for President Kaczynski, Prime Minister Morawiecki, and Deputy Prime Minister Gowin to note his rather fundamental errors as a party propagandist in the area of Poland's relations with the EU."
" EU referendum in Germany too, he demanded on Twitter. We demand a referendum in Germany immediately. Very similar to Höcke: I demand a referendum on whether Germany should remain in the EU. He knows that the majority of the German people also want to get out of EU slavery. His request does not correspond to the AfD's basic programme. There, only fundamental reforms of the EU - with Germany's continued membership - are demanded."
" EU trade deal carve-up on quotas 'dangerous' for farmers, warns Carthy A ROW over post-Brexit import quotas has reared its head again, with the EU fighting battles both internally and internationally.Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy (right), the agriculture committee's lead MEP on the subject, says the Commission has too often thrown farmers under the bus in trade talks, and fears the same will happen when the EU and UK divvy up their agriculture quotas at the World Trade Organisation. I'm very critical of the overall EU trade agenda, it's very dangerous, Mr Carthy told Farming Independent."
" EU would bring Chancellor Kurz a win-win situation with preferential voting model Man Othmar Karas cannot be accused of being a media-shy politician. Whenever there is a need to stand up for the common Europe or to criticise the EU-scepticism of the coalition partner FPÖ, he is there. It is all the more astonishing that the head of the delegation of the five MEPs of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth at the start of an EU election year."
" EU: How the parties want to mobilise Election campaign. The match for Europe has begun. While the FPÖ is backing the EU opponents, the SPÖ, ÖVP, Neos and Greens are taking a more or less pronounced pro-EU course. Vienna."
" EUROPEAN POLICY The British vote on the EU could change the nature of cooperation to such an extent that Denmark should reconsider its membership of the Union, says the Danish People's Party. --At a time of growing EU scepticism in several countries and a controversial Dutch 'no' vote in an EU referendum last week, voters in Britain go to the polls on 23 June to decide whether to say 'yes' to the country's new deal with the EU or leave the bloc altogether. The result could have major consequences across Europe.In the DF leadership, political vice-president Søren Espersen points out, like Kenneth Kristensen Berth, that the party hopes for a British yes to the new agreement with the EU, which is a rejection of the idea that the Union should constantly move towards closer cooperation. They also both point out that a no vote in the referendum does not necessarily lead to a British goodbye to the EU."
" Each will preside over individual specializations such as taxation or European policies, but it goes without saying that the names that most color the Salvinian scrum pack are once again the two No Euro parliamentarians, Claudio Borghi and Alberto Bagnai (also a professor in Pescara). The signal that comes out for the European chancelleries and for the area of the center-right moderates is clear: for now, no self-criticism on the old watchwords on the euro and Brexit. And so if there is a lowest common denominator between the choices of the PD and the Lega, it is that the pro-market exponents of both parties come to a halt..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" Earlier, Baudet let it be known that he wanted to put leaving the EU to the people first through a referendum. . As long as there is no corrective referendum, the question in or out of the EU is theoretical, the FvD leader justified his party's ambiguity about the Dutch position in the EU.0"
" Earlier, French President Hollande also railed against the rise of radical right-wing populism in Europe. A European victory by parties like the PVV, the Front National and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) could lead to ''regression and paralysis,'' he said. Herman van Rompuy, President of the European Council, stated that populism and nationalism do not provide answers to EU challenges."
" Economists and investors yesterday took note, at most, with astonishment. Instead, the substance is that yesterday Conte presented to Brussels a draft budget unchanged or little more. Neither M5S nor the League are giving up a cent of the spending plans for citizenship income (9 billion per year) and early retirement (7 billion per year); as for that, the only difference is that the League now accepts that withdrawal to quota 100 (62 years of age, 38 of contributions) remains possible only until 2021. After that, at least in theory, it would return to the current regime.This is a budget structure similar to what the EU Commission had called an unprecedented violation."
" Economy Minister Giovanni Tria has promised that debt reduction will continue and will be a crucial objective in regaining investor confidence. But it will have to reckon, on the one hand, with the costly electoral promises of the Lega and Movimento Cinque Stelle, and on the other with European constraints. The confrontation with the EU Commission will resume at the Ecofin in Vienna on September 8.In the meantime, foreign buyers prefer to keep away from Italian risk."

" Eighty percent of our legislation comes from the EU. So if you don't vote now, you are giving away 80 percent of your influence on what happens in the Netherlands.' What would change if the PVV were to get an absolute majority in the European Parliament? 'Then we would dismantle the EU. We are in favor of economic cooperation with all those European countries, the location of the Netherlands is ideal for this."
" Elections are poll on Europe brussels The elections on September 12 are to be a major referendum on the future of the Netherlands in the European Union. We can no longer be the ATM of corrupt member states, says front man Barry Madlener of the PVV in Brussels and confidant of Geert Wilders. This week he expressed the wish that our country would leave the EU. Leader PVV in Brussels happy with anti-EU position Wilders Madlener (43) is very pleased that his party leader has once again thrown the cudgel into the fire."
 End of the Brettljause. A recurring rumour is also related to EU hygiene rules. Tabloids and the FPÖ went into a tizzy when it was said that Brussels banned the serving of food on wooden boards. The truth: There is actually a hygiene regulation that advises against using wood in the preparation of food.
" Entering, after the rising phase, the mature phase means, as sovereignists, becoming national-conservatives and speaking to social groups, groups and sensibilities different from the original nucleus, which has also expanded a lot.This is a lesson to which the sovereignist political forces must also pay attention, even though they have been able to gain access to power thanks to a parliamentary system, such as the Fpo in Austria and the Lega in Italy, or could enter it, such as the True Finns, the Swedish Democrats and the Dutch Forum for Democracy, which already represents a more mature evolution of the sovereignist movement. In Italy the sovereignists, i.e. the League (we don't know what the 5 stars are, but they are certainly not anti-EU) are in government, but it is time for them to fully assume the role of right-wing forces, without chasing vague slogans such as neither right nor left. It is then time for a new hegemony (and new elites) to begin to be built in addition to the power of government."
" Enthusiasm is particularly high among Green party supporters (94 per cent), followed by supporters of the SPD (79), Left Party (78) and CDU/CSU (75). Supporters of the FDP are somewhat more sceptical: two-thirds support the EU-wide approach; for the AfD it is only about one in three.The slight majority of respondents are more critical about the speed of the vaccinations that began in Germany at the end of December."
" Especially since, contrary to the bullish declarations, Kaczynski and Morawiecki are afraid of the EU. They may veto EU climate policy, they may cry out that they will not allow the EU to poison Poland with Western miasmas, but they know one thing: if it came to a sharp confrontation between the government and the EU, most Poles will leave PiS, not wanting Polexit. And the muzzle bill could lead to such a confrontation at the height of the presidential election campaign."
" Europe as seen by the National Front Louis Aliot, vice-president of the National Front, was in Bergerac on Monday as part of his campaign for the European elections. In each of the 18 departments of the region, the general councillor of Languedoc-Roussillon visits a local company and meets the militants."
" Europe is a continent - it doesn't make much sense to be for or against it. Why shouldn't the elections be about what kind of Europe we want: strong and self-confident, or weak and divided? Democratic, or intergovernmental? Voters don't want progressive politicians to keep explaining why they want to cede all power to bigbrother-Brussels; they also want to hear why SP leader Emile Roemer and PVV leader Geert Wilders are so eager to weaken Europe and what price they are willing to pay for our isolation.The middle parties are the most to blame in the debate over Europe."
" Europe is becoming an easy target for populism. Yet, between the Italian government's backtracking on budgetary issues, and the RN's backtracking on abandoning the euro, one gets the impression that no one is thinking of dismantling the EU or leaving it. Why worry today? Of course they are."
" Europe's right-wing parties, which want to form a joint group in the EU Parliament after the European elections, show clear similarities in their choice of language. Controversial statements such as Negro conglomerate or the comparison of EU/national socialism by FPÖ MEP Andreas Mölzer are part of their repertoire. In the current European election campaign, from the Front National to the Sweden Democrats, some of these groups are trying to present themselves more seriously."
" Europe's right-wingers are struggling with their own nationalism For the new group in the EU Parliament, a common denominator across borders is being sought A Europe of fatherlands was propagated by the AfD in the election campaign. Against the EU, the nations should be strengthened. But on Monday morning after the election, party leader Jörg Meuthen, when asked whether the AfD would run again under such a slogan, swerved into technical terms: In the spirit of subsidiarity, he said, a wise distribution of competences between the regional authorities had to be sought."
" Europe, now what? This is the question Politiken has been trying to answer for the past week. But the EU project has already failed, says Søren Espersen (DF), who in this email correspondence with former Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard (R) lashes out at EU supporters.Because the EU economists knew that the euro was not suited to Greece's economic capacity or its way of conducting economic policy."
" Europe: after the elections, what place for Europhobes? ""We're coming!"" The Rassemblement National's campaign slogan for the European elections on 26 May suggests that, for the first time, Eurosceptics and Europhobes will enter the European Parliament, and even win a majority. In reality, it is mainly a question of making people forget that they are already widely represented but that they carry no weight because they have not been able to unite, and that, as a result, their record is nil."
" Europe: how Le Pen wants to regain credibility The campaign for the European elections is gathering pace in the National Rally (RN, ex-FN). Given the lead in several polls, the party is facing a slight rise of La République En Marche (LREM) since mid-January, which its leaders blame on the airtime available to the President of the Republic with the great national debate."
" European banks and insurance companies are pushing to reopen the financial markets, which were strictly regulated after the crisis in the USA. It is therefore to be feared that the markets will again be withdrawn from democratic control. Criticism of the EU Commission's new proposals came on Tuesday from the SPÖ, the Greens and the FPÖ."
" European elections: Marine Le Pen wants to put a stop to the EU Châlons-en-Champagne (AFP) - Marine Le Pen said Friday that the European elections could be an opportunity to put a stop to the European Union and tip the majority in the European Parliament, facing a weakened Emmanuel Macron and who panics. The president of the National Rally (RN, ex-FN) was Friday his first trip since the summer holidays to the Fair in Châlons-en-Champagne (Marne), in the presence of MEPs RN, before his political return on September 16 at a meeting in Frejus (Var).Asked whether the RN was already campaigning for the May 2019 elections, she stressed that it is in a permanent campaign: ""We are fighting a daily battle against this European Union and it is obvious that we are already ready to explain to the French people the reasons why, more than ever, the European Union must stop,"" she added, in front of the press."
" European elections: the FN calls on ""the people to express their anger at the ballot box"" Because the far-right party benefits from the momentum recorded at the municipal level - the mayors were in fact put forward and acclaimed yesterday. On the other hand, in the midst of a surge of Euroscepticism, he benefits from polls that give him 20% to 25% of voting intentions, i.e. a potential of around twenty MEPs (compared to 3 in 2009, with 6.3% of the vote)."
" European legislation must be reduced to the core: the common market and to some extent environmental issues. But no one can tell us how to regulate marriage or treat sexual orientation, said the Law and Justice president, complaining about tendencies to radically restrict freedom of speech and religion in the EU. They are manifesting themselves by closing Catholic adoption centres in the UK that refuse to help homosexuals."
" Even Beata Szydlo, in exultation, said that Poland and Europe are our home, although at one time she brought the EU flag out of the prime minister's office. PiS tried to combine two conflicting messages: we are not leaving the EU, but we remain Eurosceptic. It is us Europe is imitating, not us Europe."
" Even Neos top candidate Angelika Mlinar, who wants a United States of Europe, does not want to disempower Austrian politics in education policy, for example. Only FPÖ top candidate Harald Vilimsky spoke out against more EU. He called for decision-making authority to be brought back to Austria."
" Even after repeated enquiries, the opinion remains that the amount is not reflected in the budget. Even Peter Boehringer, budgetary spokesman for the AfD, sees things differently. He shares Weidel's fundamental criticism of the listing of EU expenditures. Even though he says that the post can certainly be found."
" Even half a year later, he was still upset when Van der Bellen confronted him. When the British voted to leave the EU at the end of June, to the applause of the FPÖ, Hofer had to distance himself from it a little later when it became clear that the Brexit was not well received. In doing so, however, he let down those voters who had hoped for exactly that from him."
" Even if her actions were slow, she forced people in power to constantly react to the procedures being implemented. It is easy to imagine that for the preachers of the philosophy of getting up from one's knees and people posing as the embodiment of national pride and sovereignty every necessity of responding to the letters of the European Commission, every debate in the European Parliament, every report of the Venice Commission (an institution of the Council of Europe, whose reports were used within the EU in the processes undertaken) was a humiliation. There was a growing internal fury in the people of the Law and Justice party, initially unleashed on opposition politicians, who were accused of being informers, hagglers and national traitors. However, when this became too much, the blade of frustration-driven criticism was directed at EU officials: Timmermans, Juncker and Verhofstadt."
" Even if there are hardly any historical parallels between the formerly regionalist farmer's party SVP and Austria's once German-nationalist third camp, both groups today rely on the same slogans. They demand a stop to asylum and immigration, the reintroduction of border controls, a strong nation state and a tough stance towards the EU. Like the FPÖ, the SVP is gaining more votes in urban centres. It is penetrating ever deeper into traditional strongholds of the left and liberal bourgeoisie."
" Even in the case of a negative asylum decision, the alleged Kurdish fighter should have been granted toleration, according to the Ministry of the Interior. The day after the crime, Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) had already spoken of inadequacies in the existing international asylum system that needed to be repaired at EU level. Preventive detention impossible"
" Even more so after becoming the target of its rivals, who presented populism as another danger of destabilization of the Eurozone, for its forceful speech against austerity and for its claim of recovering sovereignty by the States.Uncertainty and fear of a crisis are not usually good allies and that has put fear in the body of the coalition, which until Thursday was convinced of overcoming the PSOE. It even seemed that she was going to be the main beneficiary of the scandal of the recordings of the Minister of the Interior.Brexit poisons two issues already recurrent in Podemos: an economic program based on shooting up public spending by 60,000 million euros -in full financial alert- and the promise to call a referendum on the independence of Catalonia. The British experience has shown that this type of consultation can be lost and unleash harsh economic consequences, but expectations in Unidos Podemos remain high."
" Even on the subject of EU enlargement, the FPÖ has to jump over its shadow. The new government is committed to the admission of the Western Balkan countries to the EU. Although the FPÖ has so far supported the accession of Serbia, it has been hostile to the other countries in the region."
" Even parties that are in principle positive about the European Union say yes, but .... The SPÖ, for example, hopes that this will help them to win protest votes from potential FPÖ voters who blame the EU for all the misfortune. It is an old but still popular game of politicians, also in other EU countries, to always blame the EU for their own failures."
" Even the national wing, whose representatives saw it as a kind of (re)affiliation with Germany, at least of an economic nature. The young Jörg Haider was also an ardent supporter of the EU. At election rallies in Carinthia in the 1980s, the acclaimed FPÖ regional party leader told his supporters that South Tyrolean farmers were so much better off than Austrian farmers because they were in the EU. When the time came for the EU referendum, Jörg Haider was the most vehement opponent of EU accession."
" Even though there are rumors of numerous troublemakers, Juncker had to defend himself in the Europarliament - for the second time in just 24 days of his mandate - due to his involvement in the LuxLeaks scandal on the favoritism granted to multinationals, banks and foreign companies when he was premier of the Grand Duchy. This time the motion of censure of the M5S, supported by the Eurosceptic parties Ukip of the British Nigel Farage, Front National of the French Le Pen and Lega Nord of Matteo Salvini, has produced a session based on very harsh accusations and embarrassed defenses You represent the worst image of Europe, if you have a shred of dignity if you leave immediately - attacked Marco Zanni of M5S presenting the motion of no confidence in the classroom -. You are not on the side of European citizens."
" Even when we put issues on the agenda and address them that they too see, they usually don't cooperate with anything. Laurence Stassen (PVV) sees it differently. Criticism of the EU by citizens and the PVV is generally ignored. Voices of dissent are ridiculed in the EP, but we will not be silenced."
" Ever hear anyone say that Merkel now has less to say at the European meeting table? Has Poland's role been played out because Warsaw is frustrating European climate policy? Or Paris' because it protects its farmers? The fear of the Netherlands in Brussels is a different one. Namely, that we are a guide country. That PVV-like parties will soon be keeping a government afloat in many more member states. And this, according to eurocrats, cannot be warned against early enough."
 Everyone can say what they want. What if the FPÖ's course on the EU continues to tighten? Where are the red lines of the ÖVP?The FPÖ is clearly on course in terms of European policy.
" Everything else comes later, and matters little. If it served to reduce immigrants, Salvini would not hesitate to blow up the European Union. The League has a worldview and an ideology, sovereignism; it therefore has a network of international connections, from Putin to Le Pen. The League has a leader, or rather a captain, it moves like a Macedonian phalanx and razes the currents to the ground."
" Everything we want to do passes through the renegotiation of the European treaties - said Saturday evening Matteo Salvini at the end of the meetings with Luigi Di Maio - Because if they do not change the European rules, do not change the parameters, the constraints imposed by Europe, Italy suffocates and on this it seems to me that the commitment is common. If so, the possible next Lega and Cinque Stelle government will go to Brussels and European capitals with a demand to change the treaties. One can imagine that they are those of Maastricht and Lisbon and that the objective is to reduce the Stability Pact to zero (although it is not entirely clear)."
" Ex. Europol, while sovereignty in the other areas of EU legal policy is retained in Denmark. Since then, the Danish People's Party has put forward various alternative proposals.A few days ago, Danish MEP Morten Messerschmidt (DF) proposed a model where Denmark, following the British example, would renegotiate the Lisbon Treaty's Protocol 22, which links Europol cooperation to the Schengen Agreement."
" Exactly, a jackal, says Cicchitto. Exactly, adds Dem Fiano: For the League, deaths and votes are the same thing. Of course, they recognize in the majority, there is much work to be done, the EU has left Italy alone, in Libya you can not get to the head of a political and military situation out of control. But all this does not depend on the Italian government."
" Experts consider such a restriction to be justifiable. However, to be on the safe side, they plead for an EU-wide solution. The FPÖ has tabled a resolution to this effect in the House. Within the government, Foreign Minister Kurz has driven the debate in Austria on changes to the social systems in the EU."
" FF backs SF in bid to reject EU beef deal Call for Government to 'listen' after 84 to 46 defeat A BRUISING defeat was last night inflicted on the Government over the controversial Mercosur beef deal.Fianna Fáil, among others, yesterday supported a Sinn Féin motion which stated that the EU trade deal 'is a bad deal for Ireland and for the planet', calling for its rejection."
" FPÖ EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky, on the other hand, announced that he would vote against the Commission. The FPÖ considers one commissioner per EU member state to be too many."
" FPÖ MPs have so far not supported any further development of the EU, even if this would have been in line with their own party line. For example, FPÖ MEPs abstained from a vote on more competences for the EU border protection agency Frontex, voted against stricter controls on persons at the EU's external border and rejected (with the exception of one MEP) a stronger exchange of information between the 28 national tax authorities to fight tax avoidance by international corporations. @JV Extension."
" FPÖ against EU and against exit study. The FPÖ is attempting a balancing act with its criticism of Europe: on the one hand it is raging against Brussels, but on the other hand it does not want to offend those voters who are afraid of a break with Europe."
 FPÖ believes in EU Group Common goals defined with six right-wing parties Vienna The euro is a misconstruction for them. They fear an Islamisation of the Union through mass immigration.
" FPÖ confirms its strict course against the power of the EU After the traditionally politics-free Blue Monday for the Freedom Party after winning the elections, the FPÖ bodies met on Tuesday and confirmed their strongly EU-critical course. MEP Andreas Mölzer: ""In the next five years, the FPÖ will continue to be the only party for which the interests of our homeland have priority and not the guidelines of the Brussels headquarters. However, EU-friendliness is a coalition condition of the ÖVP."
" FPÖ does not advocate EU-wide speed limit 140 Third on the list Petra Steger explained positions in Chat Vienna Petra Steger, third on the FPÖ list for the EU elections, outlined in a STANDARD chat on Monday how her party would have handled the refugee influx in 2015 better."
 FPÖ has EU action against Hungary examined Kneissl requests legal clarification ÖVP voted unanimously for proceedings Vienna/Brussels Austria's governing parties have not found a common position on the EU's action against Hungary over the weekend.
" FPÖ has Hungary vote in EU Parliament examined Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Office have parliamentary resolution against Hungary examined, which ÖVP had approved Brussels/Vienna The position on Hungary is again causing contradictions in Austria's government."
 FPÖ insists on Viennese veto in EU foreign policy Conflict in the government: Secretary General Vilimsky rejects abolition of the unanimity principle The European Union should retain the principle of unanimity in common foreign policy. It is important that all Member States continue to be involved in the decision-making process and have the possibility to veto decisions in the EU Foreign Affairs Council. This is what MEP Harald Vilimsky demanded on Tuesday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
" FPÖ leader Strache: We are guided by the power of love Speech II. Against the SPÖ, against the EU: Strache calls for duel with[Vienna/UW] Flags behind the lectern, red-white-red badges for the audience, the ambience discreet, almost intimate: Heinz-Christian Strache strives for a statesmanlike staging at his keynote speech before the bank holidays at Palais Epstein."
" FPÖ mobilises against EU, SPÖ tries to calm down Tthe Austrian parties reacted to the Greek vote according to a familiar pattern: while the government side tried to calm down and score points with understanding and restraint, the Freedom Party went on the attack: For them, the outcome of the referendum is an incentive to demand a referendum for Austria as well. It is not acceptable that the debtors are asked whether they want to pay, but that the sovereign is left out of the equation when it comes to the payers, said FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl on Monday: ""Before even one more Austrian cent is promised or even transferred, the Austrians must therefore be asked whether they want it."
" FPÖ no longer wants political union Norbert Hofer wants a different EU Vienna. The European Union has so far presented a pathetic and frightening picture in its handling of the Corona crisis, FPÖ leader Norbert Hofer stated on Sunday in ORF Press Hour. Therefore, the question arises as to why one still needs a political union at all, said the party leader and immediately gave his answer: I am very much in favour of withdrawing from the political union project."
" FPÖ politicians have frequently visited Moscow in the past and even signed a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party in 2016. FPÖ representatives have already travelled several times to the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia. The EU sanctions against Russia have been criticised several times by FPÖ politicians. The passage in the government programme that Austria sees itself as a mediator with Russia is considered to have been pushed through by the FPÖ."
" FPÖ reaffirms its strict course against the power of the EU After the traditionally politically-free Blue Monday for the Freedom Party after winning elections, the FPÖ bodies met on Tuesday and reaffirmed their strongly anti-EU course. MEP Andreas Mölzer: ""In the next five years, the FPÖ will continue to be the only party for which the interests of our homeland have priority and not the guidelines of the Brussels headquarters."
" FPÖ strongest EU-sceptical force? Study. Up to 203 EU-critical mandataries could enter the EU Parliament. Consequences for EU policy likely to be amplified by establishment, says Deutsche Bank study."
 FPÖ top candidate: You have to go into the eye of the hurricane EU election. Harald Vilimsky wants to change the undemocratic EU and defend the Christian West.
 FPÖ wants right-wing group at EU level Mölzer stands again in election to European Parliament. FPÖ wants to reach 20 per cent next year.
 FPÖ wants to enter EU elections with Salvini at the helm Harald Vilimsky seems really excited as he reports on the progress of his group's preparations for the European elections in May 2019 on Tuesday on the sidelines of the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg. In front of him is a STANDARD article from the day before about a detailed forecast by the Jacques Delors Institute in Berlin.
 FPÖ wants to reopen agreement with London EU Parliament. FPÖ delegation leader Vilimsky claims that his party has never made Öxit an issue.
 FPÖ warns against new EU treaty Election campaign. Chancellor Kurz's proposal was not well received by the coalition partner.
" FPÖ young star Johann Gudenus had originally accepted, but then stayed at home. Wwhy does the far right (as well as the benighted left) of Europe cuddle up to Putin's Russia? Because they see in him a champion against democracy and the hated EU. Putin wants to divide the EU and therefore finances, among others, the Front National.The FPÖ leadership was not there this time, but otherwise likes to curl up purring in Putin's lap. Recently, Heinz-Christian Strache gave a remarkable speech to the Russian-Austrian Friendship Society."
" FPÖ: Austria is being trampled underfoot by the EU Vienna On Friday, the FPÖ presented its contrast programme for the 20th anniversary of the EU referendum in 1994: In a 20-minute promotional film entitled Democracy under Pressure, the party summarises its criticisms of the Union."
" FPÖ: Kern orders new EU sanctions Tallinn/Vienna. Among his EU colleagues, SPÖ Chancellor Christian Kern expresses concern about the possibility of the FPÖ joining the government after the National Council elections."
" Faithful to the conviction that has been his since, as a Gaullo-chevènementiste student, he had switched to the No and to a pure and hard sovereignism. There is no longer any question of Frexit in the Rassemblement National. The head of the RN list, Jordan Bardella, is riding the wave of European populists while extolling the benefits of Brexit. It is not a contradiction in terms."
" Far behind are calls for the EU to work for tax payments from multinationals, stronger action against social dumping and binding climate targets for all member states. It was at the initiative of the Danish People's Party that the four parties Venstre, DF, Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives suddenly announced a joint EU proposal during the election campaign.--including that Denmark should introduce accrual principles so that EU citizens can only be entitled to welfare benefits after a period in Denmark."
 Farage and SF bedfellows when it comes to Europe One of the longest running fake news stories in Irish politics is the canard that the country is about to be forced into a non-existent European army. Sinn Féin and a variety of other anti-EU campaigners have been proclaiming it since the very first referendum on membership in 1972.
" Fears of an increase in crime did not materialise The opening of the borders would lead to a sharp increase in crime: This was the fear formulated in the tabloids and politically, especially by the FPÖ, on the occasion of the 2004 EU enlargement round. Ten years later, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BK) draws the opposite conclusion: The number of burglaries in flats and houses as well as vehicle thefts with a high proportion of foreign perpetrators has decreased, explains BK spokeswoman Silvia Strasser."
" Feldmann continued: The lack of interest in EU issues is also shown by the fact that Vienna does not have its own European Committee in the City Council. The second opposition party, the EU-critical FPÖ, is particularly thorny about the issues dealt with in this committee. This is a token construct."
" Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin called for more information on where clusters of cases are breaking out. Sinn Féin TD Louise O'Reilly said there should be a relaxation in EU state aid rules that would allow the Government to help companies financially to scale up the production of the required clothing for health workers.As the impact of the coronavirus intensifies, further decisions will be more open to critical scrutiny from politicians and medics, particularly in relation to the pace at which the country moves to tougher restrictions."
" Fianna Fáil operated a similar tooth-and-claw regime during the economic downturn of the 1980s, before the realities of government and Fine Gael s Tallaght strategy brought change to its fiscal approach. This time, Micheál Martin has offered constructive opposition to a struggling Government and, as a consequence, has created space for Sinn Féin and for politicians from the United Left Alliance. His support for the EU fiscal treaty has sharpened that divide, allowing Sinn Féin to lead the charge for a No vote in the referendum campaign.There are major differences on this occasion."
" Fianna Fáil, having had a rather uncomfortable relationship with the French Gaullists for many years, is for its part now a member of a rather amorphous and ineffectual grouping called the European Liberal Democratic and Reform Party. Sinn Féin, meanwhile, claims allegiance to something called the United European Left and Nordic Green Alliance - although, given their mutual jingoistic dislike of Europe, it is tempting to suggest the Shinners might find more congenial bedfellows in UKIP!The bottom line, however, is that even if we were to return 11 Fianna Fáil or 11 Sinn Féin MEPs, whatever message it would send to the Government at home, their influence in the Parliament would be minimal. An Independent, God help them, will be completely lost."
" Fidesz currently has 14 mandates. How is this supposed to succeed, when the ENF is excluded as a partner by all other groups in the European Parliament? That is what the FPÖ said a year ago,"" Vilimsky replied. Today we are in the government. For the EU elections, he wants to achieve the turnaround through an electoral platform, with Matteo Salvini at the head: ""He should not run as a top candidate to become Commission President,"" he explains, ""but we want to make him the face of the emerging movement. Soon the FPÖ Secretary General will travel to Rome to discuss all this."
" Finally, Angela Merkel, portrayed as the icon of German selfishness and narrow-mindedness, has actually had to play, in the front row but certainly not alone, a delicate and difficult role of mediation between the continuous requests for credit from a bankrupt country and the reasons of those who should have advanced the money (with little hope of seeing it back). Knowing that accepting the Greek demands meant legitimizing the same unsustainable claims in Spain (Podemos), Italy (Grillo, Lega) and who knows what other countries, and leading the European Union to disintegration.. © Reserved reproduction"
" Finally, previous CJEU rulings have warned. PiS rings the bell of sovereignty. It claims that the European Union is interfering in the right to organize courts, a prerogative of member states only. And that the good change is about not having sentences handed down by a judge who stole the sausage, as was the case under PO-PSL."
" Financial assistance from non-European countries is now being considered, but the challenge is so complex, and has so many worrying dimensions, that it may lead to a generalised retreat from free movement. Already, borders are closing in Belgium, Hungary and Austria; and in countries like France, European deconstruction is the main thrust of the programme of the Front National, the leading political party in the recent regional elections.This extreme logic, in every sense of the word, could be even more triumphant if it were to become the strategy of an entire country, and not the least in this case: the United Kingdom."
" First Brussels strips European countries of their national sovereignty, then it knocks hard-earned pennies out of their pockets. The fight against Brussels is presented by the PVV as a nationalistic revival. The PVV is giving a foretaste of this in the Lower House these days. Yesterday's debates on the EU emergency fund culminated in a rebellious Wilders."
" First there was Jörg Haider, who had introduced a motion for EC accession in the National Council in 1987. Shortly before actually joining the EU in 1993, the FPÖ leader turned his party towards opposition to the EU and warned of negative consequences for Austria in a televised debate with Schildlausjoghurt: first Axel.Now FPÖ Secretary General and MEP Harald Vilimsky claims that his party never made an EU exit an issue - as if he could retrospectively correct his own involvement in the Öxit course."
" Firstly, because they are not all aimed at the same targets. For the British Ukip, with its 24 MPs, the issue is clear: it is to get the United Kingdom out of the European Union. The National Front, another heavyweight of Euroscepticism with 24 MPs, wants France to leave the euro, but is more nuanced about the Union: its project is to transform it into a ""free association of states"", with a common policy on subjects such as immigration or foreign trade. Curiously, the young German AfD (7 MPs), created on the initiative of lawyers and economists, cannot be classified as far-right: it too militates for the exit from the euro, but for the maintenance of Germany in the Union."
" Firstly, the CDU/CSU parties are not very pleased that after the CDU politician Schäuble, a Social Democrat is now to lead the Ministry of Finance. Secondly, the CDU/CSU does not think much of new financial programmes for Brussels - because Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) party is afraid of being paraded in parliamentary debates by the anti-euro AfD and the at least sceptical FDP. Thus, the statements on the EU in the coalition agreement are also viewed with unease in the CDU/CSU. The word Europe appears 298 times in the 177 pages of text."
" Fischler calls for clarification on coalition with FPÖ Kickl and Vilimsky are unacceptable Coalition conflict over Kurz plans for EU Innsbruck For Franz Fischler, the upcoming European elections are a decision on the direction to take: for the first time, a break-up of the Union is a possibility to be considered."
" Florian Philippot supports Syriza against the EU For the FN vice-president, the Greek political crisis reflects the ""springtime of the European people"". Regarding the New Year's Eve affair between young people from the UMP and the FN, Florian Philippot sees it as a non-event."
" Florian Philippot supports Syriza against the EU For the FN vice-president, the Greek political crisis reflects the ""springtime of the European people"". Regarding the New Year's Eve affair between young people from the UMP and the FN, Florian Philippot sees it as a non-event. Florian Philippot, Tuesday, in the Figaro studio."
" For Brussels, the worst case has been averted The head of the EU Commission had also warned against the FPÖ.Brussels."
" For Claes de Vreese of the University of Amsterdam, the nuance of a hard Nexit wish from supporters is understandable. The professor of political communication researches the attitude of voters towards the EU. His figures show that FvD supporters are rather divided on Nexit: about 60 percent are in favor, 35 to 40 percent against. In addition, the party is targeting entrepreneurs in financial-economic terms."
" For Karas, in any case, it is clear that there must be a clear rejection of the Öxit, Austria's exit from the EU, which the FPÖ demanded a year ago, as well as of gimmicks such as flirting with an exit from the euro. Karas accuses the SPÖ of irresponsibility, of having withdrawn. SPÖ head of delegation Evelyn Regner pointed to memory lapses on the part of the FPÖ. The latter belonged to the group of extreme right-wing parties in the EU Parliament, which it had co-founded with the leader of the Front National, Marine Le Pen. She had never committed herself to the integration of Europe."
" For Kurz himself, the EU is less a grand vision than a construct that needs to be pruned. Regarding the fact that his partner, the FPÖ, is making common cause with EU destroyers like Le Pen, Orbán, Salvini et cetera, all we ever hear from Kurz is that there are those in the EU who are morally superior and believe they have to educate others .sounds like great tolerance for the intolerant. This does not mean that Kurz himself is an anti-democrat."
" For MEP Luca Fontana, ideologue of the Salvini League, Britain's exit from the EU would be proof that the European choice is not irreversible. We will send a delegation to London to express our support, Pini announced, although relations with Ukip are bad after Farage decided not to join the ENF, the anti-EU group in the Parliament in Brussels. Here the League gets along well with its traditional allies, primarily the Front National of Madame Le Pen with whom Salvini never misses an opportunity to exchange visits, appreciations and even dance steps, as at the Lyon congress. Then there are the Austrian liberals of the Fpo, the Flemish of the Vlaams Belang, the Dutch of the charismatic Geert Wilders and a little bit of Romanians, Poles and Czechs who can hardly be deciphered."
" For example, a clear majority of 59 percent of the population rejects a deepening of the Eurozone with its own finance minister and a common budget. On the other hand, the idea of leaving the euro or the EU does not have the support of the majority. This was one of the reasons why the FPÖ already changed its European policy line during the presidential election campaign. Statements on the Öxit were revised, proposals for a new EU vote in Austria were no longer pursued by liberal politicians."
" For example, in 2015, 82% of Dutch people still indicated that Switzerland was a member state of the EU, while this is not the case. Over 40% said they did not know what the EU does. Especially supporters of the PVV think that membership of the EU costs them tons of money and that a Nexit will be good for their pockets.Incorrect"
" For example, in terms of fighting tax havens and fighting the race to the bottom between countries in corporate taxes, says Hummelgaard. In Denmark's largest declared EU-sceptic party, the Danish People's Party, there is positive surprise that the Commission President now also openly presents options for less union. It is, after all, a step towards setting some limits on what the EU should deal with."
" For example, the VVD suggests expelling Italy from the Schengen zone if it does not register foreigners properly. The CDA calls for more intensive border controls, even though they are prohibited at the EU's internal borders. And the PVV proposes to abolish just about all treaties. We are in the middle of an asylum crisis, rants PVV member Sietse Fritsma, who is in favor of reintroducing border controls but would rather close the Dutch borders altogether."
" For example, the oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev expressed his sympathy and support for the FPÖ. The FPÖ lobbies for Russia's foreign policy positions in a number of statements and broadcasts. NATO, the USA and the EU are also repeatedly criticised. In 2009, Strache spoke out in favour of Russia joining the EU."
" For example, the proposal states that a party must endorse European values.' What does that mean for a party like the PVV or the UK Independent Party, who don't like the EU?'I am not concerned with specific parties, but with the general."
" For example, those of Birgit Kelle (author of the anti-feminism bible Dann mach doch die Bluse zu) and Hedwig von Beverfoerde. Both are companions of Beatrix von Storch, the new AfD federal leader. Their circles fight against the EU's gender mania, participate in the anti-abortionists' March for Life and denounce the alleged early sexualisation of children. They can count on the Christians in the AfD, a group that was once founded with Bernd Lucke's blessing."
" For him, however, there is no need for the FP leader to say anything. Strache had already disqualified himself because of his European policy: The Strache-FPÖ is not on the ground of the common legal basis of the EU. For me, this is an enormous dividing line. Having a basis for discussion is the be-all and end-all among democrats, says Karas, but achieving common goals requires more."
" For it can be ruled out that the EU will develop in the direction desired by the FPÖ within a year. Should the FPÖ actually decide to campaign to leave the EU in a year's time, this would probably be the start of its National Council election campaign. The FPÖ has no legal means to push through an Öxit vote."
" For many years, the DF has formally supported EU membership, but makes a political living by criticising the Union. Will Kristian Thulesen Dahl take responsibility for an EU policy that does not closely match the Danish People's Party's own?Man can say that the formal Europe Agreement is in everyday life mostly for decoration, but for DF it has great symbolic meaning with a very concrete consequence."
" For me they are no burden. Martin Lidegaard, if it is such a clear advantage for Denmark to participate in the EU's common immigration policy, why are many Danes so sceptical about it? I think the Danish People's Party has succeeded in linking the debate on foreigners to the EU and making the EU the villain on foreigners - even though in practice it is almost the opposite. The EU is probably the only organisation that can provide whole and sustainable solutions to these challenges."
" For me, however, the unword of the year has no alternative. We do not want such one-dimensional thinking with regard to the EU -- the FPÖ also profits from the EU. She makes a good bogeyman."
" For once, the fear was not in the eyes of the interviewer, as when the patriotic press is allowed to pick up a quote from the blond leader, but from the cornered interviewee. The Briton reminded Wilders that if you criticize the regime in China or Russia, you can pay with death, not in Brussels, not in Strasbourg. At that, the PVV leader resorted to claptrap: Europe is not totalitarian for citizens but for member states. Also in the past, foreign reporters successfully drove him into a corner."
" For questions, however, Putin is not the one to turn to. I was a co-founder, but am no longer a member because I am head of state. Moscow maintains warm relations with more anti-EU parties (FN, Lega, PVV, AfD). That makes sense, says the man who does not tolerate interference at home."
" For that to happen, however, border controls must be reintroduced, and that is a sine qua non requirement, most recently declared MEP Morten Messerschmidt. With a reintroduction, the party refers to the agreement on permanent customs control, which the UK government introduced after heavy DF pressure in 2011. It was subsequently criticised by the European Commission, Germany and several other countries before being scrapped by Helle Thorning-Schmidt's (S) newly elected government.In the midst of the current debate about the composition of a blue government, several leftists yesterday warned against border control."
" For the FPÖ, the success of the negotiations on the allocation of portfolios gives reason for the greatest satisfaction. Those who know the FPÖ, of course, know that the rejection of economic sanctions, EU commissioners and free trade agreements is still present and will become loud at the first tests of strength.And formulated differently: The black-blue government does not have to fear any significant resistance at home or abroad, Brussels has other worries and problem bears, in Austria the SPÖ and above all the Greens first have to find themselves again."
" For the SP, which proposes to ""better regulate free movement"", border repression ""and the communication that accompanies it"" are ""the easiest and unfortunately most popular vectors"", but are ""a short-sighted policy"" that ""ignores the EU's medium-term demographic needs"". The UMP has put immigration at the top of its list of proposals and is proposing the creation of a European Commissioner in charge of these issues. The FN party wants to leave the Schengen area and re-establish ""national borders"" in order to ""rapidly restrict"" drug trafficking and the influence of ""nomadic foreign crime"". Marine Le Pen's party also proposes the ""suppression"" in French law of the ""possibility of regularising illegal immigrants""."
" For the next few weeks, however, he has brought a few prominent comrades-in-arms on board: Brigitte Ederer, the former Secretary of State for Europe and later Siemens manager, for example. She believes that a party like the FPÖ does not have to formally withdraw from the EU; rather, it is enough if they do not like anything and do not want to shape anything. Then it's a mental exit."
" For the time being, he has taken 13 billion euros out of the 86 billion euros of the third bailout, which will allow to continue paying pensions, salaries and expenses for a little while, has this been Tsipras' masterstroke or the last trick he is pulling on his partners? I do not know, but this time they do not have to fool the Brussels bureaucrats who, leveraged in their positions, pray that he fulfills his commitments, but the parliaments of the paying countries, which only reluctantly passed this third Greek bailout, warning that it will be the last one, and if their politicians do not revolt, their more than enough public opinion will revolt. Except, of course, the populists of the left and right, who are against the government, against the euro and against the European Union. In Spain, this group is headed by Podemos, a sister party of Syriza (although one would have to ask which Syriza, the original or the splintered one), which, in the face of Tsipras' escape, has had simultaneous panic and jubilation attacks. While their leader in Andalusia, Teresa Rodriguez, trembled at the thought that the same could happen to them, their bosses, Iglesias and Errejon, considered it a show of courage and patriotism, forcing Teresa to retract."

In Spain, this group is headed by Podemos, a sister party of Syriza (although we should ask which one, the original or the splintered one), which, in the face of Tsipras' escape, has had fits of panic and jubilation at the same time. While their leader in Andalusia, Teresa Rodriguez, trembled at the thought that the same could happen to them, their bosses, Iglesias and Errejon, considered it a show of courage and patriotism, forcing Teresa to retract."
" For the time being, the party has been angry that the wretched of war and poverty are trying to climb over the walls of Europe. Double standards are a hallmark of the Danish People's Party.Bent Melchior, Nørre Farimagsgade 64, Copenhagen: The strongest reservation we have made in relation to the EU is probably the rejection of using the euro as our currency. This does not prevent us from putting the krona rate very close to the euro rate."
" For the world of the Net it is a sufficient period to render them already obsolete and therefore to modify.The game however is not simple. The Movement will have to find new allies in Brussels who have their own interests in espousing this battle. The League, for example, which like the Five-Star Movement moves much of its propaganda online, has come out against the copyright directive (even though two of its MEPs voted against it). Provided that the negotiations do not proceed with full sails arriving in port, perhaps, before the elections."
" For this very reason, Europe must also be excluded. The issue of the EU would be an obstacle that could prevent the marriage of bridegroom and bride even before the goal is reached: Working for the strengthening, i.e. the deepening of the EU, is not possible with the FPÖ. And the SPÖ cannot (yet?) be won over for an exit from the EU."
" For this, Lucke is still being attacked in his own ranks. For the leader of the Tories, David Cameron, had recently pushed ahead with accession negotiations with Turkey - a country that the Islam-critical wing of the AfD definitely does not want in the EU.If you ask Lucke about internal party power struggles, he is calm."
" For those who have listened to the party's recent claims to be pro-European, the emergence of this video is a timely reminder of the real values at the heart of Sinn Féin, said Smith who pointed that while the Lisbon Treaty was rejected by voters at the first time of asking, it was passed in a second referendum after legal assurances about Irish neutrality. Backhanded compliment Sinn Féin may find the backhanded compliment from Farage unwelcome but it is not the first time the two forces have found common ground. Back in 2012 during the referendum on the EU Fiscal Treaty, which Sinn Féin strongly campaigned against, McDonald and Farage appeared together calling for a No vote in a national radio debate on Today FM chaired by Matt Cooper."
" For us it is about the ideal of a well-governed Netherlands. With the leadership of Baudet we will not get there. According to Baljeu, the new party led by Otten wants the Netherlands to stay in the EU. FvD wants a Nexit.Also the Zeeland Statesman Robert Brunke is stepping down from FvD. Brunke says he can no longer defend Forum's positions."
" For us, Russia belongs to Europe. After the party conference, MEP Lars Patrick Berg resigned from the AfD over the Dexit demand. He argues that the EU is in urgent need of reform, but it remains our best vehicle for achieving security and prosperity. How do you react to this?"
" For us, most of you do not see that as an option: 67 percent reject such a measure. EU President Van Rompuy said that if European countries return to their own currencies, as the PVV wants in the Netherlands, the European Union will fall apart. You are not at all comfortable with that."
" For young people, it is over 20%, Eurostat figures show. The election could also boost extreme parties such as the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) and the Bulgarian Jobbik, both of which are so controversial that several Eurosceptic parties - including the Danish People's Party - have cut ties with them.--Those parties in particular prompt Martin Schulz to call the rise of the far right a European problem and a warning."
" Foreign Minister Kurz (ÖVP) had also already rejected a Turkish ultimatum - Europe must not become dependent on Turkey. It is clear to me, Kurz said in the Ö1 Morgenjournal, that we must not give an inch here. FPÖ MEP Harald Vilimsky and Neos party leader Matthias Strolz spoke out in favour of an end to EU accession talks with Ankara."
" Forget the reform craziness. Mette Frederiksen is warming up for an election campaign in which the main enemy is the Danish People's Party - which she wants to beat on the party's own turf.This means a historically EU-sceptical Social Democracy that promises welfare voters gold and green forests, and that will at least initially stay far away from the long-term reforms that hurt voters and do the economy good.While it will be easy for the left to keep up on welfare policy - and similarly difficult on immigration - the radicals will be in a tough spot."
" Former EU State Secretary Brigitte Ederer (SPÖ) hit the nail on the head in a Kurier interview with Josef Votzi on the occasion of the successful accession negotiations 25 years ago: It has never been possible to anchor Austria in the minds and hearts as part of this European Union. The right-wing populist to extreme right-wing parties in the EU from Salvini's Lega to the FPÖ and Orbán's Fidesz to Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National want to destroy the EU. One must not be deceived by talk of a different , a reformed EU."
" Former Environment Minister Elisabeth Köstinger (ÖVP) and the Upper Austrian Environment Regional Councillor, Rudi Anschober (Greens), reacted sharply. FPÖ environment spokesman Walter Rauch called on the EU to intervene against the Czech nuclear fantasists."
" Former president Wellink of De Nederlandsche Bank and finance minister De Jager got away with saying we would make a profit on our loans to Greece. Similarly, in responses to the European Commission's recommendations, the PVV, the SP and the VVD indicated that they believe Brussels should not interfere with our domestic economic policy choices, such as on the mortgage interest deduction.Minister De Jager considers the Commission's economic criticism to be a very fat pass for the Spring Agreement."
" Fortunately, she has a partner in the new French President Emmanuel Macron who thinks the same way. Qquestion: Where will Austria be found there? The question also arises because it is quite likely that the FPÖ will be in government from October. A party that is traditionally EU-sceptical to anti-EU and in any case has a different image of the EU than the current one.Merkel and Macron will try to steer an EU that is trying to make the best of the Brexit craziness and the uncertainty caused by Trump's Nato ambivalence."
" Forza Italia has already presented a question stating that the EU Commission even invites employees not to refer expressly to the Christmas period and not to use only Christian names such as Mary or John because they are considered harmful to different religious sensibilities. Blue MEPs, first signatory the former President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, ask the EU Commission to modify the text in respect of the Christian roots of the European Union. Harsh criticism also came from Giorgia Meloni (FdI) and Matteo Salvini (Lega). I share Berlusconi's words, Draghi is working well as Prime Minister and therefore I hope he will go on working well as Prime Minister for a long time. So the Secretary of the League, Matteo Salvini, in relation to the election of the new Head of State and the invitation of the Cavaliere so that refsti to Palazzo Chigi."
" Forza Italia, Lega and Fratelli d'Italia ask for changes to the Stability Law, and together they emphasize that it is urgent to deeply correct the text in light of the serious terrorist attack in Paris, for adequate interventions on resources for law enforcement and armed forces, to ensure national security and concretely address the threat of Islamic terrorism. The League asks that Renzi demands flexibility from the EU on the accounts and invests a billion for security.Alfano in the evening responded in this way, also ventilating the possibility of asking for further margins of flexibility in Brussels: I am the first trade unionist in this category on this front, I want more money for security, I will ask for it and I am sure I will get it."
" France and Germany intend to draw up joint proposals on EMU reform by March 2018, which are expected to generate considerable momentum. At least for the FPÖ, which has vehemently opposed EU support for Greece and called for a bifurcation of the Eurozone, further development of the monetary union is likely to cause difficulties. Austria will be confronted with a similar problem in the negotiations on the multi-annual financial plan."
" France was against it, with good reason. And then there are still very strong anti-European forces: in France the party of Marine Le Pen, in Italy the Northern League.Young people are asked to learn to live in uncertainty and precariousness: isn't that a little unfair?"
" France will work with the Italian government carefully to respect the result of the elections, the commitments made by everyone in the EU and the eurozone and the core values of the EU, French European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau announced. Austria urged M5S and Lega to dialogue and avoid breaking with the EU.Latvian European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, who leads the center-right strict commissioners, urged a responsible fiscal policy, reinforcing earlier calls by his Finnish colleague Jyrki Katainen."
" France's Emmanuel Macron has lost popular support, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to survive politically as a chancellor on call. Europe is a continent in shrinking mode and is now waiting to see what crisis will hit it next: Will Italy's banks crash and put the euro at risk? Will Marine Le Pen pass Macron in the European elections in France? How strong will the German AfD be in the European Parliament? How will the community react if refugee numbers rise again?In the midst of crisis management, Europeans are once again in danger of overlooking the fact that they can only meet the challenges of the world if they are united."
" François Bayrou: ""Let's not make eurosceptics an obsession"" We must stop making them the obsession of this election! Those who only talk about the National Front are campaigning for the Le Pens instead! The message of the pro-Europeans is so strong that we should not fear any opponent: the world speaks for us! The world today is China, it is Putin, it is the arms race and intimidation, and financial superpowers, and terrorist or criminal networks. In this world, the question is simple: will France and the European countries be stronger if they are united or divided, together or each for himself? We answer without hesitation: we will be stronger if we are united."
" Free from the constraints and from the cage of the European Union we return to live! And in the meantime Renzi threatens Brussels but then drops his pants by passing the European budget with a cowardly abstention. That's also why on December 4 #iovote, was the comment of Northern League secretary Matteo Salvini.Johnson: Italy supports soft Brexit or it will no longer sell prosecco in the UKIn the meantime, between Italy and the UK it was Italian prosecco that ended up in contention over Brexit. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who became foreign minister after supporting the Leave party, warned that Italy would be better off siding with the British to remain in the single market in order to continue selling prosecco in the UK."
" Freedom of speech is not possible within this party. Wilders wants the Netherlands to leave the EU. Euroscepticism becomes Euro-hatred. So the whole story is: their Brussels, our Netherlands, my PVV. You can't take this party seriously anymore, can you?"
" French Foreign Minister Nathalie Loiseau welcomes the salutary condemnation of the violent yellow vests, though Di Maio's closure is not clear-cut. Because building a new European group is proving complicated, and therefore, keeps open a glimmer: If there will be an interlocution it will be with those who believe in democracy While the government sews up with the historic European ally, the same government seems to want to shake the European Union. It is Claudio Borghi, economic manager of the League, to raise the exit of Italy from the toxic and failed project of the EU. In ten minutes the spread jumps to 280 basis points."
" From France comes a wind of Freedom, he concluded, on May 25, the nightmare of Napolitano, Angela Merkel and the Euro supporters will become reality: another Europe is possible. A few hours later he would better indicate his strategy: The Northern League fights alongside Marine Le Pen and all that front, that alliance that wants another Europe. The battles we share are against a euro that has proven to be a criminal currency, against uncontrolled mass immigration, and to regain control over labor, trade, agriculture, and currency."
" From September 2014, products with more than 1600 watts of power will be banned, and from 2017, products with more than 900 watts will be banned. Six months ago, MEPs from the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Greens defended the measure in terms of the necessary energy savings, the Freedom Party (FPÖ) criticised the EU's regulatory frenzy, and the non-party Hans-Peter Martin sensed a billion-dollar deal for the hoover lobby."
" From an analysis of the data, Kieskompas concludes that a referendum campaign can still strongly influence opinions. Supporters of PVV, SP and SGP in particular think the EU should first address its own sores View the original page:"
" From the Irish point of view one of the deep ironies of the whole situation is that the three political parties in the UK most hostile to the EU are the Conservatives, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin. Considering the sinister role played by the Tories in blocking an independent all-Ireland parliament a century ago, there is something comic about Sinn Féin joining them and the heirs of the Ulster Covenanters, 100 years on, to fuel the anti-EU paranoia that underpins the British drive for withdrawal.When Irish voters go to the polls in the inevitable referendum, or referendums, that will be required to sanction deeper European integration, Sinn Féin is again likely to be at the head of the forces campaigning against co-operation with our gallant allies in Europe .Irish voters would have the choice of staying with the EU and the euro or returning to being a British dependency and resurrecting the link with sterling."
" From the failed Macedonian head of government (Nikola Gruevski) to the current Serbian president (Aleksandar Vu i ), they were all rooting for him for that reason. A possible government participation of the FPÖ could in turn make Vienna's foreign policy more critical of the EU, even if the position of foreign minister does not seem within reach for the right-wing populists. Gazeta Wyborcza"
" From the stage you always hear his name, the Boris, almost always followed by criticism. Shortly before, Palmer had called for closing the EU's external borders, armed if necessary; he didn't sound much different from the AfD.Palmer is shunned by his colleagues at this party conference, he almost always walks the hall alone, he does not sit with the delegates but mostly at the journalists' tables."
" From these shifts, both proponents of more EU and opponents can get ammunition for the upcoming European Parliament elections. For some time now, the PVV in particular has been campaigning more against the EU than against Islam. The researchers confirm in so many words what Prime Minister Rutte says about the participation society: it already exists."
" Front National could count on a quarter of the French vote, over 20 seats. The other parties in the newly formed Eurosceptic group must fear that they will soon be outstripped by Marine Le Pen's party. So the PVV will not become very big. For foreign media, such as the German newspaper Die Welt and the Spanish news agency EFE, the loss last night was the biggest news of the Dutch exit poll."
" Front national ""Oui à la France, non à Bruxelles"" The FN is opposed to the European Union. He wants to leave the euro and return to the national currency, the FN is leading in the polls with around 23% of voting intentions, with a very slight lead over the UMP (within the margin of error)."
" Fundamentally anti-EU parties like Sinn Féin insist that they are not really anti-Europe, but somehow they always end up campaigning for a No vote. Fianna Fáil sources insist that the party is not in the business of competing with Sinn Féin for the populist anti-EU vote, but the party needs to stake out a clear position if it wants to put those concerns to rest.There is every chance that the Supreme Court may have to make the final call this time around."
" Future MEPs with a Eurosceptic label - from Italy's League to Germany's AfD and France's Rassemblement National - are likely to make up a large contingent in the next chamber. But for the French, the consequences would be rather negative."
" Garraud (RN): ""No question of leaving Europe"" The former UMP deputy, candidate on the RN list for the European elections, wants to ""transform"" the European Union from within.."
" Geert Wilders limited himself to one A4 page to proclaim his `historical mission': out of the EU, out of the euro, guilder back, borders closed, no `Eurabia'. Not all of those things are achievable in the EP, so the PVV's election poster is more nuanced than its election program: Less EU. It takes some effort to find the European election program on the CDA website."
" General Secretary for Social Affairs Herbert Kickl took on outgoing Chamber of Labour President Herbert Tumpel in a party statement and accused the Chamber of Labour of a lack of resistance to the opening of the labour market to the East. This seems bizarre, of course, because during the Tumpel era the AK had to listen to criticism from all over Austria because of its restrictive stance on opening up the EU to the East. Kickl's blue taunting is only a small indication that the FPÖ has lost its way in the face of Frank Stronach's ten-percent election successes in Lower Austria and Carinthia. She seems clueless and helpless, as she did in the National Council election on 29."
" German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls for immediate implementation of the agreement. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, convened the video conference of EU leaders for April 23. League leader Matteo Salvini said that the agreement is a masterpiece. He also announced a request for a vote of no confidence in Gualtieri."
" Germans stay cool despite Brexit - and want more Europe This is how Germany thinks after the quake in London: the majority of German citizens are backing the EU, strengthening the political centre and punishing the AfD. A look at the state of the nation's soul in three chapters Two weeks after the historic decision of the British to leave the EU, the Germans appear calm."
" Germany's membership in the EU is welcomed by 88 percent of non-populists and 69 percent of populists. Out of the EU is a slogan that does not catch on very well. Perhaps that is why the AfD largely avoids it, while the far-right splinter party NPD propagates it aggressively.The fact that European integration has gone too far is a finding that can also be heard - behind closed doors - among politicians from the CDU/CSU and the SPD."
" Giorgetti confirmed the version of the Quirinale thus contradicting the Pentastellist leader. Di Maio and Salvini have already mobilized the squares for Saturday, June 2, Republic Day, in Rome (the M5S) and in many capitals (the League), with watchwords against the EU and the Quirinal that in the person of the president has already suffered death threats on the Net. Friday 1, however, the PD will take to the streets in Rome to defend the Constitution and Mattarella, who has already had the solidarity of 14 constitutionalists led by Enzo Cheli and tens of thousands of citizens with the petition I'm with Mattarella."
" Giorgia Meloni must admit that the center-right is not a palace operation, we are convincing on the ground. Lega and FdI support your candidate even in Piedmont and then wage war on you in Rome and Brussels. I want to look at them as campaign excesses of a party moving on the threshold of apportionment."
" Given the clear vote last Sunday, there is also no reason for well-meaning European partners to complain and warn. Despite some cross shots, the ÖVP remains in the mainstream of EU policy, and the FPÖ leadership seems determined not to deviate from this course. By so vehemently claiming the Ministry of the Interior for himself, Heinz-Christian Strache also makes it clear that he is not demanding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
" Greater hurdles have been overcome, he said. Sinn Féin's paper also outlines some of the potential consequences of a vote to leave the EU. It says Brexit would harden the division between North and South in Ireland, with the potential for customs checkpoints, trading tariffs and adverse knock-on effects for all-island economic activity and co-operation.Negative impacts"
" Greens who focus more on outward appearances than on breadth and content remain grounded. And last, but not least, an FPÖ that is all about xenophobia and anti-EU (and currently France's racist far-right Front National) is doing remarkably well, but is taking itself out of the game as a government partner.All parties, including the SPÖ and ÖVP, did not put very attractive, serious candidates on the field."
" Group chairman Geert Wilders, who introduced the presentation, eagerly embraced the findings and wants a referendum on reintroducing the national currency. With the guilder, we ourselves are back at the controls, and not the eurocrats in Brussels or Frankfurt, the PVV leader said.According to British researchers, the advent of the euro has caused the Netherlands a significant loss of prosperity."
" Growth is estimated at 0.9% in 2016 and 2017, 1.1% in 2018. Moscovici added downside risks for Italy, caused by the banking system with large impaired loans and political instability, which he did not link to the contrasts later confirmed in the PD leadership. He specified that he was referring to populism, which aims to get out of the EU and the euro, calling it absurd and dangerous. The Northern League, allied in Europe with the Eurosceptic French Marine Le Pen, has objected to this interference in domestic politics by a commissioner, who should show independence. Heavy remains the Italian maxi-debt, which has continued to rise under the governments of Matteo Renzi, Paolo Gentiloni and Pier Carlo Padoan to 132.8% of GDP in 2016 and is estimated in 2017 at 133.3% and in 2018 at 133.2% also due to additional public resources to support the banking sector and small investors."
" Gudenus just puts a viciousness on it. While Kurz and Strache presented their agreement and promised the Federal President an EU-compliant stance, the right-wing extremists Marine Le Pen and Gert Wilders called for the destruction of the EU in Prague. The FPÖ is in a parliamentary group with these people in the EU Parliament. She does not intend to resign at the moment, it was said afterwards."
" Guglielmo Picchi, former deputy elected abroad for Forza Italia and then moved to the League, is working on it.Even in Europe there is a new opportunity: the Brexit. For MEP Luca Fontana, ideologue of the Salvini League, Britain's exit from the EU would be proof that the European choice is not irreversible. We will send a delegation to London to express our support, Pini announced, although relations with Ukip are bad after Farage decided not to join the ENF, the anti-EU group in the Parliament in Brussels. Here the League gets along well with its traditional allies, primarily the Front National of Madame Le Pen with whom Salvini never misses an opportunity to exchange visits, appreciations and even dance steps, as at the Lyon congress."
" Haider immediately saw that he could collect votes from the roughly 25 per cent of hard-line EU opponents and forced a futile No vote with idiotic arguments Schildlausjoghurt. Today's FPÖ is also hostile to the EU, it just tries to hide it. Or to deny it against all evidence (a classic technique of the right-wing extremists, by the way)."
 Haimbuchner against FPÖ anti-EU election campaign Linz Upper Austrian FPÖ leader Manfred Haimbuchner is clearly against an EU exit campaign in the presidential election. The FPÖ is certainly not an EU exit party.
" Haimbuchner does not want his statements to be understood as criticism of Strache and Hofer. Hofer had made it clear how this was to be understood, Haimbuchner said, referring to Hofer's recent rejection of an EU exit.The Tyrolean FPÖ leader, Markus Abwerzger, also considers an Austrian exit from the EU to be absolutely counterproductive. This was factually not feasible, he said."
" Harsh words that victimize Spain in front of Brussels.3Eurodeputies. . These are the seats that Vox won in the elections, which will be four when there is Brexit.0"
" Haven't hugged my mother in a year. Hugo de Jonge call me. The lesser known twitterer John Jansen - anti EU, anti Islam, PVV - wrote that Rutte was right to praise Olympians who trained for years and sacrificed a lot, but so do entrepreneurs.I saw Dutch people tumbling over each other off the map with arguments for and against."
" He accused ÖVP delegation leader Othmar Karas of acting head-on against the ÖVP's European line under Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. The Chancellor would therefore not put him up again in the EU elections, the FPÖ Secretary General claimed.In an interview with the Standard, Karas sharply rejected Vilimsky's accusations in Strasbourg on Wednesday."
" He already argued this in 'Pro Europa so against the EU' (Elsevier, 2012) and his PhD which was titled 'Attack on the Nation State' (Bert Bakker, 2012). In 2013, Baudet was one of the founders of the Burgerforum-EU, which petitioned for a referendum on further transfer of power to the EU. Baudet then founded the Forum for Democracy, a think tank promoting a new democratic revolution. According to this club, the future belongs to open platforms in which people themselves determine who to trust, what to find, what to do."
" He also calls on Lars Løkke Rasmussen to contact David Cameron as soon as he has formed a government, with a view to establishing a common strategy between Denmark and the UK. -- In EU policy, the Danish People's Party has long mirrored the British Prime Minister's EU-sceptic course. The EU agreement between the four bourgeois parties makes it a top priority for a new government to bring together an alliance of like-minded EU countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Finland and work together to ensure that the EU does not develop into a social union."
" He also lies when he says that in Vox we want to abolish the autonomies. The autonomic system has broken the political unity of affections and is as expensive as it is inefficient, and the rest are lies: for example, when he says that in Vox we want to leave Europe. In Vox we oppose, precisely, those who want to liquidate the EU to turn it into a new reich where national sovereignties disappear. We want the Union to be a club of partners, where all Member States are respected, and that does not allow -as is happening now- the affront that Germany and Belgium are giving to Spain, protecting coup plotters before the cowardly silence of this Government... and of Ciudadanos.Arcadi is also lying when he tries to equate us with the nationalists."
 He announced at the time that all necessary measures would be taken in the House to prevent Ceta and TTIP. Now the FPÖ pledges to support the ratification of the agreement between the EU and Canada in the National Council. Agreed literally: the ratification and implementation of the Ceta trade agreement agreed on 18.10.2016 in the Council of Ministers and subsequently on 30.10.2016 by the European Union and Canada.
" He announced that there will be more similar meetings in the future. The leaders of Eurosceptic and nationalist parties are to work out a common vision of changes in the EU. According to Krzysztof Sobolewski, secretary general of the Law and Justice party (PiS), this is an important conversation about the possibilities of closer cooperation in the EP and seeking answers to threats and consequences of violations of treaties by European institutions, especially the EC.Euro MP Beata Mazurek wrote that this is a meeting to defend values and the future."
" He announced this collaboration with much fanfare last week when he received Marine le Pen of Front National. Now the opportunity arises to shape that cooperation, he is not there! Who can still understand this? What can the voter count on now? Yesterday in Vienna anti-European parties discussed cooperation in the European Parliament to form a front against the power of Brussels, exactly the goal Wilders is pursuing. In Vienna, the parties with which the PVV seeks cooperation, such as Front National, Vlaams Belang, Lega Nord from Italy and the Austrian FPÖ, were also at the table. Logical But the PVV was not there."
" He appears convincing in the eyes of many when he threatens to use the bulldozer to kick out the Roma, and fires back at illegal immigrants. He has a great talent for complaining emphatically about the injustices caused by Brussels rules. But in economic matters the leader of the League does not shine. His big idea to lift the country's finances is to introduce a flat tax."
" He asked the EPP leadership candidate to read the AfD party programme. It clearly states that we want to reform the EU at its core, but not abolish it,"" explained the AfD leader, who is a member of the European Parliament in Brussels.In fact, at its European Party Congress in Riesa, Saxony, in January, the AfD had called for a radical reform of the EU within a reasonable time."
" He asked the EPP leadership candidate to read the AfD party programme. The AfD leader, who is a member of the EU Parliament in Brussels, explained that it clearly states that we want to reform the EU at its core, but not abolish it.In fact, at its European Party Congress in Riesa, Saxony, in January, the AfD called for a radical reform of the EU within a reasonable period of time. Should such a reform fail, Germany would have to leave the Union (Dexit)."
" He believed that it would be prudent to have a bailout facility there. Sinn Féin s EU spokeswoman Kathryn Reilly called on the trade union movement and civil society to unite and reject this austerity treaty. There is not one article in this treaty that can be thought of in any way of being of benefit to social justice, to the environment, to women s rights, to children s rights, to young people or to any progressive sector of society."
" He brought home less than 200 thousand votes.Other is, however, the political reflection. Anti-European parties such as the League and Fd'It can propagandize themselves with the Brexit, attesting that it is possible to leave Europe (the speech will undoubtedly be repeated targeting the single currency) and that it is necessary to change the current Europe. Topics on which the two parties insist, such as migration, will be more vigorously flaunted, pointing out the failures of Europe."
" He doesn't have a target audience yet. With his anti-EU statements and his rejection of the ESM protection fund, Stronach is entering FPÖ territory, but the FPÖ is successfully occupying this topic. In doing so, he is again alienating the very clientele he had lured with his economic liberal tones in the beginning."
" He doesn't have to, it's even reasonable, but then he doesn't have to say anything about empty phrases and self-evident things (dialogue, intensified cooperation). On the other hand, Kurz could have said something long ago about the foul-mouthed (Federal President Van der Bellen) and slanderous outburst of the FPÖ Secretary General and MEP Harald Vilimsky against EU Commission President Juncker. After all, Austria holds the EU Presidency."
" He even defined this fundamental divide more bluntly: progressives on one side, nationalists and demagogues on the other. In my country, the leading European party is the FN. Has it improved Europe? I haven't seen it,"" he said from Belgium."
" He fears for his image as a tourist destination: travel agencies from Japan have announced that they will no longer come if Austria elects the right-wing candidate. Muxel describes Öxit statements by FPÖ politicians, i.e. on leaving the EU, as a dangerous threat .Fischer on the merits of Van der Bellen: ""As a person and in terms of his professionalism, he is not on the leash of party politics. Proving that will be the big challenge."
" He had also never said that he would vote for Alexander Van der Bellen, as was sometimes reported in the media. He had only stressed that in the event of a possible run-off election between Van der Bellen and Norbert Hofer (FPÖ), he would speak out against the anti-EU FPÖ man. A spokesperson for Griss said that although Busek was not on the committee of persons, he was a supporter of the candidate."
" He has been active for the Left Party since its foundation. If we don't get politically involved, Windberger says, we leave the stage to others. The wrong ones, in his eyes: the opponents of the EU, the Salvinis, the Orbáns, the FPÖ. Windberger is the Neos' liaison officer to other liberal parties and citizens' movements in Europe."
" He has often called for an end to bloc thinking and a reversal of the trend in relations. At the same time, the current Council President does not have the nerve to publicly question the EU decisions. Postscript: even if the FPÖ, which sits in the sidecar over Kneissl in terms of foreign policy, would like that.Even sanctions are good business."
" He himself has always been rather close to the FDP, he says. And then he saw Bernd Lucke talking about the euro and the EU on a talk show, and he liked that. You may not remember, the AfD was founded as a party critical of the euro. At that time, it was called the Professors' Party because so many economists and financial scientists were in it."
" He immediately starts against Beppe Grillo, the incoherent. Like the League enemy of the euro, unlike the League, says Le Pen, friend of immigration: You can not be against the euro and in favor of immigration. Grillo is like Mélenchon (leader of the French radical left), his is a politically weak analysis."
" He is a ruler without a word who, moreover, has taken on the representation of anti-European political values. It is no coincidence that its main supporters in the European Parliament were parties like Podemos, or right-wing extremists like Marine Le Pen or Nigel Farage. This coalition of ultras of both ideologies has as a common basis its anti-Europeanism and has found in Tsipras and his referendum the last-minute battering rams against the European project.It is therefore no longer enough to ask whether Greece will be able to pay the bailout it is now asking for, but whether it is a reliable partner for the European Union."

" He is also an alderman for Reconstruction and has taken the lead in the protest against Europe. He wants to clarify that anti-Europeanism has nothing to do with it, even if the League and M5s (the latter, however, has abandoned the anti-EU thrust) make a common front with him. But this time the technocrats of Brussels have made it big by erasing pain, mourning and ruin of the earthquake of April 6, 2009: they demand that the State return the taxes that had been rebated or suspended to facilitate the rebirth of the affected area. This commendable measure of the government is considered by European technicians a state aid and therefore is inadmissible."

" He is also favored by the contrast of speaking with Merkel and next Friday with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, in La Moncloa, as opposed to the failed tour of Pedro Sánchez, the Secretary General of the PSOE, through Latin America, who has not even managed to meet, as announced, with the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto. The Ibero-American leader cancelled it for agenda reasons. Merkel, it is known in La Moncloa, is worried about Podemos. After the Greek experience, even more so. Much of the hardness that the German government imposed on the European Union to stop Tsipras' plans was not used thinking of that country, but of the precedent that the arrival to power of a government that questions the rules of the European game and endangers once again the economic stability of southern Europe could mean for Spain. But what the German government has also learned from the Greek experience is not to interfere in someone else's election campaign."
" He is not doing that explicitly now either, but he is setting the course for an Öxit campaign. For it can be ruled out that the EU will develop in the direction desired by the FPÖ within a year. Should the FPÖ actually decide to campaign to leave the EU in a year's time, this would probably be the start of its National Council election campaign."
" He is one of those multiculturalists who have not thought of the consequences. The EU farmer, known from the Villach carnival, is running for the FPÖ in the EU elections.Manfred Tisal, genau."
" He is the only opponent of President Macron, he mentions the idea that the latter will not finish his five-year mandate, he thinks that his turn will come quickly and says to himself The departure of Florian Philippot from the FN signals the abandonment of the party's anti-European social-sovereignist line. Without doubt, it is not a matter of people, but of ideology: the French are not ready for the adventure of leaving the euro and returning to nationalism behind the borders."
" He is the president of the Lombardy Region, the Legazian Roberto Maroni, who has put the interests of his region before those of his party. In fact, in contrast with the Secretary of the League, Matteo Salvini, who did not want to make this gift to the EU, Maroni immediately made available to Ema the Pirelli skyscraper ready for use. Then, while being embittered by the way in which the failure occurred (a serious institution does not choose based on compasses just because it does not want to displease anyone and does not know how to choose barefacedly), he opposed another time to Salvini who asked to rediscuss the 17 billion we pay every year to Brussels."
" He is tinkering with other right-wingers to create a bloc of EU-unfriendly people who are united in wanting to blow up European unity, destroy the European institutions in their present form and make their protagonists look ridiculous - all for the supposed good of the nation-states. So long as Vice-Chancellor and FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache does not personally call for Austria's immediate withdrawal from the EU, the Freedom Party will have the sanction of Sebastian Kurz to shake up Europe in this election campaign. In order to maximise their own voter potential, the ÖVP and the FPÖ need a coalition space in which they can also act against each other under controlled conditions."
" He later vociferously demanded that sanctions imposed on Russia be withdrawn. Today Kaczynski is to talk with him - these are the words of important PiS politicians - about the future of the European Parliament. Salvini and Kaczynski will probably agree that the current EU should be dismantled and built anew as something resembling a free trade zone, without the European Commission interfering in everything.A year ago, the fact that the head of US diplomacy was persuaded to visit the rather squalid party headquarters in Nowogrodzka was supposed to prove that PiS remains in the mainstream of European politics despite its protracted dispute with the EU over the judiciary."

" He must now pave the way for it, although both he and his henchmen are taking the fat game to a higher level by leaving it undecided what, if anything, they will recommend voters to vote for. Thulesen Dahl is aware that European policy is a soft spot that needs to be cleared before the DF can enter a coalition government. With the wait-and-see reaction to Brexit, he has prepared a retreat to an EU policy that may be sceptical, but not so sceptical that it matters. This will also put distance between him and the EU opponents on the left, who are demanding a referendum on Danish membership, but who are left alone when the DF does not back them."
" He noted that Messerschmidt spent only 18 words on his own vision for the future of the EU, while the rest was spent reviewing Europe's history over the past 500 years. What is the vision for the EU, which the Danish People's Party still thinks Denmark should be a member of? A platitude that the EU must be reformed and reduced to a cooperation in a structural form that Europeans can live with. The paradox is that this is exactly what we have today."
" He prefers institutional gridlock to keep the topic of Europe down. Renzi, on the other hand, by attacking the EU that does not work (and where Italy has always counted for little), actually takes space away from the most critical oppositions against Brussels (Beppe Grillo's M5S and Matteo Salvini's Lega Nord). Next Wednesday, on the eve of the Council of Heads of State and Government, the Euro-socialists intend to launch in Brussels the project Together to guide the EU to accelerate with a progressive line."
" He quickly retracted that comment, but it sticks to him. And then we had Le Pen's mediagenic visit this week to the Lower House and PVV leader Geert Wilders, which should be the beginning of the end of the monster from Brussels. Especially in the Netherlands, it seems that the European ballot at the end of May is not a typical parliamentary election, but a referendum."
 He said Ireland wanted nothing to do with a backward-looking idea of sovereignty. Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said the aim of the EU should be to prevent a land frontier between the EU and Britain on the island of Ireland and the North should be afforded designated special status within the EU.Agreement
" He said it was crucial that maximum information was provided. Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said it was a bad treaty for Ireland and the EU which would institutionalise austerity and cost taxpayers at least an additional EUR 6 billion in public spending cuts and tax increases after 2015..Socialist Party TD Joe Higgins said the referendum debate would demonstrate clearly that permanent austerity is proposed , and further disastrous damage will be caused to the domestic economy ."
" He said its silence had been striking in relation to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. Critical approach He also pointed to the critical approach of Sinn Féin, Mr Flanagan, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, to the Canadian-EU free trade agreement. Free trade has been the central underpinning of Irish economic development."
" He said that the European Union today is not just a community where you can travel without restrictions, but a political union, united by democracy, solidarity, support for ambitious climate policies. The PiS government treats the EU as something external that threatens Poland, imposes unbelievable solutions. Thus, he does not accept the judgments of the CJEU, and treats the EU reality à la carte, meaning he chooses what suits him."
" He said this in a press chat on Monday. Nevertheless, he did not want to miss his work in the EU Parliament: At the beginning, there were two Freedom Party mandataries, but in the meantime we have become our own parliamentary group. The 52-year-old explained that he had initially appeared as an EU critic and was now promoting the EU election in a video with federal party leader Heinz-Christian Strache: The FPÖ was the first European party in Austria and had always advocated the unification of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals in order to secure peace and prosperity. However, over-regulation and over-dimensioning are strictly rejected."
" He sees a crisis in the EU, wants to make it a union of the people, to develop it further. The FPÖ is also committed to the EU in its party programme. And as Hofer says, he is not thinking of leaving."
" He sees the same trend in Denmark, where the bourgeois parties have become more sceptical about the EU, and therefore believes that a united Danish voice is needed before EU leaders reconvene for a summit in mid-December. It has opened up for us to have a debate that is not only about yes or no to the EU, but where we can instead discuss what we want to be part of in the EU, says Kristian Thulesen Dahl, who rejects that the new pragmatic tones from the Danish People's Party in relation to the EU is about the party running itself into position to enter a future government. No, in the Danish People's Party we will not get into a situation where participation in government is the goal and where we change our policy to get there."

" He spoke about the adoption of the European Charter on Women's Rights and the full implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The head of the Spring party also listed other demands of the party: the introduction of a limit of waiting time for a doctor to one month (after exceeding this deadline, the National Health Fund would have to finance a visit in a private office); pay rises for nurses and medical workers (&bdquo;Enough of a lousy state, enough of a cardboard state!); launching work in the EU on a European program to fight cancer; moving away from coal and promoting renewable energy sources (&bdquo;No more smog, time for clean air!); a common European passport for the entire EU.Law and Justice (PiS) leaders visited Lublin on Saturday, where the PiS president declared his opposition to Poland's adoption of the euro currency. - Our victory in the elections will guarantee that we as Poland will act rationally in this matter."
" He stresses time and again that he has nothing to do with Europhile visions and sees cooperation primarily as a means of making money. The loss of the PVV was indeed unexpectedly large. Apparently, Wilder's rabid plea to leave the EU did not capture the imagination enough. But immediately interpreting the result as a vote for more Europe can work like a red rag on a bull and is unwise."
" He vehemently opposes a rescue programme for the financial sector, says Michael Fuchs, deputy leader of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag. And in Angela Merkel's entourage, there are fears that a billion-euro support package for the Italian banks in Germany without the participation of the creditors would strengthen the AfD in particular. They could easily argue that the EU is once again not taking its own rules seriously - and they would be right.--On the other hand, however, the chancellor fears that"
" He wants to manage social opposition, which was aroused in Poles by the actions of the new government - paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal, the attack on the media and the civil service. The PO's advantage may be the continuation of its pro-European course in opposition to PiS, which has more and more reservations about the EU.Good that Schetyna showed a group of leaders: Tomasz Siemoniak, Rafal Trzaskowski, Borys Budka, and also former Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, who gave a strong speech yesterday, accusing PiS of the biggest election fraud in the Third Republic of Poland."
" He was also brought to power by Putin's support (the wiretapping affair). Out of hatred towards the EU, PiS is committing a betrayal of the fundamental interests of Poland. - Roman Giertych pointed out. The goal of the pro-Putin European right is Putin's goal."
" He was not yet an MP when he and his friends were already making taxpayers contribute millions to printing toilet rolls for the Ukraine referendum. In the final stage we were also told that Ukraine did not interest the organizers: it was about the EU. Then Mr. Baudet came up with a political party: Forum for Democracy. Mr. Baudet had a classical education, so he knows that a forum is the place for exchange of ideas."
" He was of a completely different opinion than the two, said party leader Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday. The coalition negotiations, however, would be continued with full force. Othmar Karas, head of the ÖVP delegation to the EU Parliament, expressed clear criticism: ""With their trip to Crimea, the two FPÖ politicians disavowed the EU's foreign policy,"" he said to theSTANDARD"
" He will continue to take control of it and at the same time limit the powers of the courts in favor of the prosecutor's office as has been done before. PiS questions the competence of the EU Court of Justice and considers that it has no right to deal with changes in the judiciary. It ignores in silence the previous positions of the representatives of the CJEU, as if they did not exist."
" He would have thought the British were more reasonable. The former leader of the Greens thinks that the FPÖ will one day instigate an Öxit referendum is out of the question because of the balance of power in parliament. On Wednesday, Upper Austria's FPÖ leader Manfred Haimbuchner assured that his party did not want to run an EU exit campaign: ""There is certainly no Öxit sentiment that should be supported in any way. But this is not a criticism of the party line."
" He would judge Turquoise Blue in Vienna by their actions nothing else. The President of the European Parliament was even more amicable: he invited the young Chancellor, whom I believe will make great progress in Europe, to a plenary session in Strasbourg, to a debate with the MEPs. Tajani did not even mention the FPÖ.Kurz had achieved his second main goal: Austria's European policy is almost exclusively associated with him in Brussels."
" Health Minister Stöger (SPÖ) wants stricter penalties and controls. The FPÖ immediately criticised the EU, and Green Party leader Eva Glawischnig whimsically said she would like to know whether the horse in her lasagne had won the dressage competition in 2008."
" Hence, the shift in focus from west to east. Two of the League's historic allies, Marine Le Pen's French Front National and Geert Wilders' Dutch PvP, have done well but have never gone into government. Better leverage on the eastern front, where, in several countries, Eurosceptics or populists have entered the control room."
" Her patience with London seems limitless. AfD leader Alexander Gauland, for example, praises the democratic way in which the Brexit came about. What we are currently witnessing is an attempt to reverse the outcome of a democratic decision."
" Here again, all political families approve: 65% of PS sympathisers, 76% of the MoDem and the UMP. Even in the FN, the idea of a European hard core is supported by 63% of sympathisers. Obviously, everyone projects their own imaginations into this idea of a ""restricted circle"", where the strong countries of the euro zone (Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries) would be found, which would avoid having to pay for the poorer countries of the South or the East..."
" Here the DF always forgets that the party itself is 'down in the EU' and could itself be the change it wants if the party took responsibility. DF has the most seats of all Danish parties in the European Parliament and is the largest Danish bourgeois party, but DF has achieved nothing worth mentioning.Home in Denmark DF refuses to give the EU system more tools, while at the same time the party criticises the system for not being able to meet the challenges we face. But how can the EU improve if countries do not want to give it the tools it needs? The DF is using contradictory arguments here, calling the EU an undemocratic rat race, but at the same time not wanting to give the EU more democratic tools."
" Here the only thing to respect is the sovereignty of Spain, which belongs to all Spaniards and cannot be questioned from dark offices in Brussels or in infamous negotiations between the government of Sanchez and the declared enemies of the nation, said Santiago Abascal, in a clear delegitimization of Europe to enter into this matter.The president of Vox blamed the European court for giving oxygen and support to the coup process in Catalonia and reproached that several allied countries, such as Belgium, question and humiliate Spanish justice in processes such as the surrender of Carles Puigdemont to Spain.Abascal strongly agitated this alleged lack of legitimacy of Europe and charged against those he described as eurosumisos. He also threatened to call for a great national mobilization against this attack on Spanish sovereignty and Constitution and in defense of the unity of the nation.The ruling and the threat of a possible immunity for Puigdemont opens for Vox the debate on what the European Union has to be. Abascal's supporters have always put a stop to the ceding of more competences in economic or legislative matters and propose the Union as a common market, with free movement but with limits."
" Here, Merkel and Schulz are not only focusing on stronger cooperation in security policy and new trade agreements, like Vienna, but also on joint investment initiatives and a clear rejection of protectionism and nationalism. Kurz and FPÖ leader Strache want an EU that focuses only on the essentials and in return strengthens the autonomy of member states and regions again (subsidiarity).6 Berlin wants speed through core Europe, Vienna waiting for stragglers"
" High praise for the new Minister of Agriculture, Gian Marco Centinaio. Full sharing of the commitments indicated in the Lega-M5s government contract on the changes to be made to the EU budget, which cut 2.7 billion in agricultural funds for Italy, but also the rejection of some international treaties, primarily the Ceta (between the EU and Canada), considered harmful to Italian agriculture. Finally, detailed suggestions on concrete measures to be taken, including those made by Salvini on the blockade of ships importing rice and counterfeit food.Coldiretti's political tack has a political significance that, as history teaches, it would be foolish to underestimate."
" Hillje: The feeling of disadvantage leads to the assumption: fewer migrants means more for me. The study makes it clear that xenophobically motivated politics can dock on to these thought patterns. But according to Hillje, the surveys show that many of these people are by no means xenophobic from the outset, and are even largely immune to the programmatic principles of the AfD or the FN. For example, against their hostility towards Islam and the EU or their demand for direct democracy.Rather, people cling to the system of parliamentary democracy and think that politicians can solve the problems."
" His analysis culminated in the fundamentally sensible call for a Marshall Plan for Africa and a reading tip for Lorenz-Dittlbacher: read this week's Spiegel article. -- form a coalition with the FPÖ? Only if the party declares its support for the EU, Zeiler said, and declined: Why not? If we leave the EU, we also leave the euro. This is really the greatest damage imaginable for an exporting country and for a tourist country."
 His daughter Marine Le Pen leads the party. The former Le Pen has often been in disrepute for discriminatory statements. The PVV of Geert Wilders cooperates with Front National in Europe. Both parties are anti-EU and against immigrants.
" His decision not to vote for Ursula von der Leyen's chairmanship (saved by Conte's M5s votes) was also misjudged in Europe. And the European Union reacted by not granting Salvini's League any office in European institutions: how to put an enemy of Europe in the house? Almost all European institutions have marginalized him: Juncker, Von der Leyen, Tusk, Merkel, Macron and Trump. Along with labor unions, volunteerism, and the Catholic Church."
" His party had blossomed in the European elections and was well on the way to becoming a ""new people's party in Germany"". He announced a ""critical-constructive cooperation of the AfD members in the EU Parliament. However, Lucke said, they would not ""pass over mistakes in silence""."
" His position differs significantly from that of the party leadership: both party leader Heinz-Christian Strache and presidential candidate Norbert Hofer have speculated on an Öxit vote after Brexit. This is in case the EU does not undertake reforms in the direction of strengthening the nation states, and in case Turkey joins the EU. Hofer even set the EU a deadline of one year, before the FPÖ-Hofburg candidate then rowed back in a much-noticed press interview last Saturday: the Öxit was not an issue after all. Haimbuchner also wants to set other priorities for EU reforms."
" His sodal is Geert Wilders, the oxygenated leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, a formation that wants to be libertarian, but stands out for its Islamophobic crusades. The two have already formed a formal alliance and are now actively courting Ukip, Nigel Farage's anti-European party that wants Britain out of the EU. Their themes echo in Italy as well, in the rhetoric of both the Northern League and the followers of Beppe Grillo. While in Eastern Europe they know an even more radical declination in the anti-Semitic ravings of Jobbik, the Hungarian extremist group, or in the virulence of the Bulgarians of Attaka."
" His stay on Brussels soil lasted only fourteen hours, during which he met with the permanent Council President Donald Tusk and then EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. He explained at length to international journalists why there would be no deviation from Austria's pro-European course under him as head of government, despite the participation of the FPÖ, which is counted among the EU-sceptical extreme right-wing parties in Brussels.At three o'clock he went to bed after polishing the government declaration, and at seven he went on to a meeting with EU Parliament President Antonio Tajani."
" His supporters reacted enthusiastically to rhetorical findings such as Brussels wolves, the big creep and leftist troela euro commissioner Malmstrøm. And whether the vampire Brussels, the Mecca of Europhiles, was allowed to suck us dry? Nope, bellowed the three hundred PVVers.In addition, the PVV leader emphasized mass immigration and the more than seven billion euro tax cut his party envisions."
 Hofer commits to the EU after all: Öxit would be a mistake FPÖ candidate is now also in favour of a fairness agreement in the Hofburg election campaign Vienna The Free Democratic presidential candidate Norbert Hofer has clearly declared his support for Austria's membership in the European Union.
 Hofer: Decision on Öxit in one year FPÖ. The Freedom Party is setting the course for a campaign to leave the EU. This would also be the starting signal for the FPÖ campaign for the National Council elections.
 Hofer: The EU project is not yet lost Talk. The FPÖ's federal presidential candidate does not expect his party leader Strache's idea of merging the offices of head of state and federal chancellor to be realised in the next few years.The Press: We have had a pretty gruesome election campaign.
" How Austrian MEPs see E-Evidence SPÖ, Grüne, Neos and FPÖ criticise the directive, ÖVP stresses necessity of plans D Negotiations on the planned directive for E-Evidence are ongoing. The position is still being negotiated in the EU Parliament, DER STANDARD has meanwhile asked the Austrian MEPs."
" How are things in our country on this front? In Italy, voter opinion of the EU response to the Covid-19 crisis is, on average, rather negative, even among sympathizers of the governing parties. But this did not fuel anti-EU sentiments. According to a Yougov poll (The most surprising indication concerns the electorate of the League and Fratelli d'Italia. Even within these basins, in fact, in the second week of April, the majority was in favor of EU coordination: 51% in the League, 65% in Fratelli d'Italia."
" How compatible are the ÖVP and the FPÖ for the presidency? Differences. In European policy, the FPÖ continues to serve its EU-sceptical voter base, while the ÖVP has come closer to it despite its pro-European orientation.Vienna."
 How could it have come to this? #NAME? These are issues that touch the core of European cohesion.
" How do you think the general Western view of Denmark has changed? I think people think that Denmark is going far in the direction of those right-wing nationalist views that the Danish People's Party is known for. Many of the examples - cutting foreign aid, the jewellery law, the ads in Lebanese newspapers, the anti-EU line - are on the Danish People's Party. I occasionally go out to discuss with Uffe Ellemann-Jensen."
" How much of the commitment of the government to promote more effective initiatives to combat evasion and fraud, in the knowledge that only by an effective fight against illegality can derive more resources to reduce the tax burden. An approach that does not contradict in substance the political designs of the League, but that definitely reassures the Brussels Commission and the other European finance ministers, whom Tria will meet today for the first time in Luxembourg (he will fly with Luigi Di Maio, expected for the Council of Labor Ministers). Initial bilateral contacts with the commissioners have been positive so far."
" How the Rassemblement National's elected representatives vote in the European Parliament The European regulation on the ""filtering"" of foreign investments should be adopted this Thursday by a large majority in the European Parliament. It is one of the new economic defence tools that the European Union has decided, too late for some, to equip itself with to counter the unfair attacks of certain partners, foremost among them China."
" How to react to this? So far, most European countries have been lining up in Beijing and Shanghai to have a slice of the financial pie. Finally, how can the increasingly aggressive Russian attempts to intervene in political developments in Europe be countered in foreign policy? Obviously, the leadership in Moscow wants to use the right-wing populists of the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen or Viktor Orbán to put a fifth column in place to weaken the EU from within.Where are the experienced Austrian diplomats or even politicians who, historically educated, find real approaches to solutions, for example for the conflict in Eastern Ukraine? Former Foreign Minister Alois Mock as well as his political foster father, Federal Chancellor Josef Klaus, always tried to learn from the past in order to find answers to and solutions for current problems."
" How will you act if the British vote themselves out? It will be difficult to achieve our interests if Denmark suddenly loses the UK as an ally in the EU. The biggest defeat will be the EU's, because then it will have failed to live up to its promise of living united in diversity. Will the Danish People's Party plead for a Danish referendum if the British vote no? It could well be a possibility to hold a referendum to give the government a mandate to negotiate something similar to the British deal.--Not the question of whether to be a member or to leave the EU altogether, but to let the Danes decide whether they want the government to work for some priorities, which are in line with what Britain has had in their mandate."
" How? Simple: with a referendum on the EU's Association Agreement with Ukraine. A coalition of Citizen's Committee EU of EU critics like Thierry Baudet, GeenPeil of the action site GeenStijl and radical parties like PVV and SP are all set. Anyone who uses the word democracy inappropriately should be distrusted"
" However, European policy is probably in good hands with the experienced and serious politician. And the FPÖ has Harald Vilimsky, who sees the EU election campaign as a kind of European political pub brawl."
" However, European policy is probably in good hands with the experienced and serious politician. And the FPÖ has Harald Vilimsky, who sees the EU election campaign as a kind of European political pub brawl. How long will it be before Othmar Karas has to contradict the migration policy views of Karoline Edtstadler? It will be fun when the liberal Christian Democrat Karas (number one on the list for the EU election) has to comment on the reactionary line of the national conservative Edtstadler (number two on the list)."
" However, Sputnik is no closer to the Danish election campaign than to garnish the news with an archive photo of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who handed over the chairmanship of the Left to Lars Løkke Rasmussen in 2009. Shockwave over the Left's course Several media are particularly aware that the otherwise EU-friendly Liberal Party has been persuaded by the Eurosceptic Danish People's Party to support Britain's line.1The British newspaper Daily Express writes about Denmark that EU supporters and Eurosceptics in the Scandinavian country have struck a surprise deal..."
" However, Vukan is somewhat perplexed by the fact that two nationwide FPÖ themes in particular have resonated with workers and SPÖ sympathisers: the anti-EU line and the foreigner issue (this theme is there subliminally). These simple messages, with which the FPÖ works, such as paying less to the EU, go down particularly well with the population. The SPÖ's position is different: it does not matter that we need the EU."
" However, a discussion on how to deal with delinquent asylum seekers had to be held. Criticism of the Minister of the Interior comes from Othmar Karas, top candidate of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) for the EU elections: The FPÖ politician is shaking the foundations of cohesion in our society and cooperation in the Union, says Karas in an interview."
" However, a large part of the many new jobs do not go to Burgenlanders, but to daily commuters from Hungary and Slovakia, just as many orders go to Hungarian and Slovakian craft enterprises. The provincial government is therefore calling for restrictions on the free movement of workers in the EU, including sectoral barriers, for example in the construction industry. FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl would have subsumed this under the slogan ""Our jobs for our people"". However, these ideas are older than red-blue."
" However, according to analyses within Austria, 42 percent does not seem realistic at the moment. As the Deutsche Bank study also puts into perspective, the FPÖ could only achieve such a good result if it succeeded in mobilising all potential EU-sceptical voters for itself and the pro-European parties (SPÖ, ÖVP, Grüne, Neos) completely failed to mobilise their voters. However, the Polish Law and Justice Party (PiS) is currently still identified as the strongest EU-sceptical force within the EU."
" However, he considers it irresponsible that our country, our institutions do not have a plan B, in the hypothesis of a definitive and insuperable crisis of the Eurozone, or of an impossible renegotiation of the rules and treaties - considered necessary by many. He is not anti-European, the former Minister of Industry in the Ciampi government; on the contrary, he is convinced that his proposals, by overcoming the current distortions that make the Union an inefficient cage that alienates growing shares of European citizens from it, best serve the very cause of the European Union.Among other things, it should be considered that the League has given up the presidency of one of the two Chambers for the Center-Right-M5S dialogue. He has accepted a name indicated by the cinquestelle for Palazzo Chigi, to start the yellow-green government."
" However, if we add to this the League, which is the most voted party in Italy and which, in turn, is allied with the Rassemblement National (Le Pen's party, the second most voted party in France), then the revolt within Europe, from folkloric, becomes strategic, so that in Europe, where they do not operate, as in Italy, political amateurs (just look at the green mice they are showing Boris Johnson's UK) have adopted the emergency plan, not against Italy, but specifically against Salvini who, from this clash, risked coming out with broken bones, as he was often reminded by his deputy secretary Giorgetti who continues to be loyal to Salvini (much to the chagrin of the great Italian media and politicians who have always focused on divide and conquer among their opponents). But Giorgetti, while remaining loyal to Salvini, is not willing to endorse a suicidal drift of the League. Which, according to him, must quickly find a cooperative relationship with the EU. I'm not saying that he should do as the Cricketers who, as a subversive force allied even to the French yellow vests, have done a double backflip that not even the acrobats of the Beijing Circus can do."
" However, it did try to support the young neo-Franco formation for its ""sensational entry"" into the Spanish Parliament. According to several RN sources, Vox could join the ""grand coalition"" after the European elections.. But according to our information, she would rather do it for Salvini."
" However, it is already clear which parties have made it onto the domestic ballot paper. And it is striking: In contrast to the 2014 ballot, this time no declared EU-exit party has received enough declarations of support for a candidacy. Although the FPÖ is loudly trying to present itself as a rallying point for EU sceptics, it no longer wants to know anything about leaving the EU. The KPÖ has also abandoned this idea, although according to election forecasts the party can in any case save itself the trouble of packing a hammer and sickle in its suitcase for a trip to Brussels."
" However, no major policy decision is expected to be announced. Speaking ahead of the session the GUE-NGL group, of which Sinn Féin is a member, said that while the referendum was a drastic warning sign of the EU's ongoing erosion, EU leaders had shown no sign of self-criticism at their first European Council summit following the referendum last week and had denied that there is any need for fundamental change.They ignore the urgent need to set the integration process back on track by ending austerity, ensuing social cohesion and guaranteeing democratic control, the left-wing group said."
" However, she was not able to assert herself with this. Nevertheless, there is still a strong wing in the AfD that is committed to Germany leaving the EU in the coming years. Many party members believe that the EU cannot be reformed."
" However, the DF would prefer to leave the reservation in place and instead make a parallel agreement like the one Norway and other countries have. If for some reason this is not possible, we propose that Denmark only chooses to be part of Europol and none of the other areas, says DF MEP Morten Messerschmidt.The upcoming referendum is given an extra perspective by the fact that European police cooperation is now on its way to play a bigger role in the fight against terrorism."
" However, the Danish People's Party, whose senior politicians have been on several study tours to the UK, insists that other key politicians on the No side will want a renegotiation with the EU. It is logical that it looks like that from his point of view, says EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth (DF) about Nigel Farage.The Danish People's Party refers to the fact that Ukip has always wanted Britain out of European cooperation, while DF only wants a reformed EU.-- But the DF understands that the official No campaign frontman, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, will seek a new link with the EU."
" However, the FPÖ does not want a forced distribution of illegal migrants, nor does it want a social union: such a union would mean that social standards would be unified and that we would have to pay money to the financially weaker EU countries. State Secretary Karoline Edtstadler, second in the ÖVP list behind Karas, accused the FPÖ of retropolitics: Vilimsky had no interest in a functioning EU, because with the current treaty Europe was not equipped for future challenges. For example, the current development towards social union would have to be strictly prevented."
" However, the entire reform package will not be put to the vote, as it was on Thursday, but individual points can be amended. For net activists, this is a great success. They had warned of the end of the free internet if the proposals were to pass the EU Parliament without amendments. The FPÖ abstained. Harald Vilimsy, the leader of the Freedom Party delegation, had previously sharply criticised the reform."
" However, the political scientist adds that there is also a good side to the lack of contours in politics. Because Kurz has achieved one thing: he has ground down the FPÖ in EU policy. There is no longer any talk of leaving the euro and other pipe dreams."
" However, the subsequent possible political initiative could go far beyond this: According to the call for tender, the creators of the feasibility study should also examine whether new national registers would have to be introduced to enable data exchange at EU level and even what prerequisites might be needed in IT systems in the member states for new national registers. Last week, the AfD in the Bavarian parliament criticised the plan. The EU octopus wants to have insight into all areas of the citizen, especially into his financial circumstances, said Martin Böhm, the party's spokesperson on European policy at the time.In July, the European Commission had already presented concrete proposals to better combat money laundering in the European Union in the future."
" However, this is corroborated by many others. Moreover, as this ""Brexit report"" notes, it is to be recommended to the Europhobes at home, from the National Front to the CGT, via the televangelists of shrinkage, including Eric Zemmour and Natacha Polony. It demonstrates - if it were necessary - that the nationalist and protectionist impulses, both linked because they are based on the idea of a harmful 'other', are destructive reflexes."
" However, this is difficult due to the fact that the EPP already has PiS's main rival on the national political scene, the Civic Platform. In the meantime it turns out that the United Kingdom, despite Brexit, will have to hold elections to the European Parliament at home, so PiS is lucky: it no longer has to decide what to do. It can again form a group with the British Conservatives and does not mix with figures like Le Pen. PiS is afraid of the latter like the devil, even when it agrees with them, because it knows that a common political group with nationalists from western countries would be subject to constant criticism from the opposition in Poland and could hurt in the elections. That's why, at least officially, the French leader's musings will go unanswered."
" However, this is not only a position of the Lega's sovereignists, but the doubts about this agreement are common to many of my European colleagues. The EU Court of Justice has asked Italy to make producers pay fines for exceeding milk quotas. The League has always defended the breeders who have produced more than the quota. What will you do now in government? One of the first things I did when I took office was to ask for a report from the offices that will also have to indicate the best possible solution protecting those who were honest and acted in good faith and those who behaved dishonestly and acted in bad faith."
" I also look forward to welcoming Mr Johnson back to Northern Ireland shortly after he becomes prime minister, she said. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said her party would continue to work with the Dublin Government and the EU 27 to protect Ireland from the catastrophic impact of the reckless Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers.Referendum Sinn Féin will work to protect our peace process and the Good Friday agreement in all its parts, including the commitment to calling a referendum on Irish unity, she added.The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the election of Mr Johnson was a worrying step toward a hard no-deal Brexit and a hard border in Ireland."
" I am a candidate for premier. The leader of Italy instead chooses the path of moderation, which he suggests to use to all his people because it seems to pay in the polls, and to those who see problems in Europe for the positions of the League says calmly that being pro-European does not mean making rhetoric, but working to change the EU, between us there is a solid pact.In the meantime, controversy continues in the parties over the composition of the lists."
" I am actually an Austrian People's Party member. But I will vote FPÖ this time, confesses a market visitor. Not everyone's focus is on the EU election. A bearded man takes the opportunity to present his case: Because of a violent crime he had committed some time ago, he could not get a dog licence."
 I am already looking forward to Sunday. FPÖ and Greens intervened on Friday against the planned free trade agreement between the EU and the USA. FPÖ chairman Heinz-Christian Strache and his top candidate Harald Vilimsky criticised the secret negotiations and demanded a referendum on the trade treaty.
 I am not playing Austria off against the EU. 80 per cent of our country's prosperity is generated in the EU.They have formulated as an election goal that the FPÖ should not become the strongest force. What would be the consequences if this European election ends with a Freedom Party victory?
" I am the somewhat decelerated variant, let's call it grandiloquent strategist. What is the FPÖ's exact position on the EU? Exit yes or no?Exit is not a stated goal."
" I ask the acting government not to compromise the future of Spain and not to accept the document on the United Kingdom, Iglesias said. While Podemos denounces Cameron's blackmail of the EU, Spain sees it as essential to give in to the independentistas and hold a referendum on the secession of Catalonia. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel García-Margallo, appeared in the Commission to explain the agenda of the European Council in Brussels, and to seek the acquiescence of the groups so that the President of the Government can negotiate the content of the agreement with the European partners, which includes the conditions of the United Kingdom to remain in the Union."
" I can detect two key points in it: tax cuts and less European cooperation. The party wants to enforce the latter through referendums on the euro and on the open internal borders of the European Union, from the idea of a Nexit. Even with the gas tap open, FvD creates a gaping hole in the budgetg--View the original page:"
" I closed it for myself. I'm watching the Brexit with great interest, but not because I can get into the Europarliament myself.EstablishmentPVV'er Marcel de Graaff was already in Parliament and will return once the Brexit is a fact as the only PVV'er after disastrous elections. De Graaff is now allowed to rest for a few months on retainer."
" I don't feel like I can say everything. For example, I vote for the Forum for Democracy and am critical of the EU. That really doesn't sit well with many of my fellow students. Tom te Buck recognizes that critical view of the Forum."
" I experience different faces of the FPÖ Interview. Manfred Weber on the ÖVP's EU list, sticking to Fideszand his ideas as a possible next Commission President."
 I fundamentally disagree with that. The PVV wants the Netherlands to leave the EU. Louis Bontes set himself against Prime Minister Rutte who has always said that he is against transferring sovereignty to Europe.
" I had hoped that these aloof EU politicians would learn the lessons of Brexit, but I don't have that impression. If this moral exaggeration of some people stops and the protection of the external borders is ensured, then the citizens could also regain confidence in the European Union.Heinz-Christian Strache (49) has been the leader of the FPÖ for 13 years and has been Vice-Chancellor of Austria for a year. The extent to which humans can influence the climate is an open question."
" I had hoped that these aloof EU politicians would learn the lessons of Brexit, but I don't have that impression.

" I have hope that after the European elections calm will return and everyone will do what is necessary. In the European election campaign, the CSU is above all raging against Brussels - in unison with the AfD Something like this fuels a latent concern that the EU is hampering our development with its activities. Some politicians push aside the fact that cooperation in the EU and the existence of the euro are very important factors for our economic success."
" I have resisted this erosion of the civic core to no avail. Right-wing populism is what was said and loudly cheered in Essen: Islam is hostile to the state, the EU is a radical left-wing project, the system must be questioned. That is the current AfD. You have never heard anything like that from me."
" I have the suspicion that Kickl is not only concerned with this goal, but is using border controls as an expression of his ideological convictions. How do you see the role of the FPÖ in this EU Presidency?The term ghost driver sums it up well."
" I think positive reactions to these impulses are possible. What long-term effects can anti-EU movements have? In the Italian case, anti-European populism - from the League to Grillo, from Forza Italia to Fratelli d'Italia - certainly weakens the weight of the country among the leading nations of the EU. And paradoxically, they may produce counterproductive effects for some of them."
" I think that is what politicians will discover or have already discovered that it is necessary to do. This would mean, for example, the end of Schengen cooperation, which ensures open borders between EU countries, concludes Vessela Tcherneva. The Schengen cooperation on which the Danish People's Party wants a referendum. And maybe an end to the eurozone as it is now, she adds."
" I want to see (...) an engaging and beautiful omen. So long live the Europe of European nations! added the former presidential candidate for whom the exit of France from the EU is no longer a priority as it was during her campaign.The FN leader, who has committed her party to a new strategy of alliances, wanted to achieve the highest possible score in France with a list open to all national-sovereignist currents.In Europe, she also expressed the wish to build alliances with other European movements, notably within the Europe of Nations and Liberties group, ENL, in the European Parliament, to which the FN belongs, and beyond."
" I was certain. This is how the vice-premier and leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, welcomed the stop to the infringement procedure by the EU Commission. Now I will propose to the government to accelerate the maneuver for next year, obviously with the flat tax, he relaunched."
" I will fulfil this mandate until the last day of my tenure as State Secretary. According to the ÖVP's top candidate, Othmar Karas, Harald Vilimsky of the FPÖ wants to destroy the EU. Do you agree?"
" I would have liked to make it even more important, but one step at a time - assures the leader of the League - There will be no patrimonial assets or withdrawals from current accounts, we will not ask for wedding rings in pledge to save the country. In the House, the big star is the Minister of EU Policies Paolo Savona, greeted by a standing ovation from the League and M5S. It is necessary to repeat what Roosevelt did with the New Deal and reforms."
" I would like the Prime Minister to recognise that it would be a good idea to initiate a process similar to the British one, says Kristian Thulesen Dahl. Unlike the Danish People's Party, several ardent EU supporters think Cameron has got a bad idea. They are worried that the idea could spread to more Eurosceptic countries."
" I would question whether this is suitable for a referendum, says Thomas Stenfeldt Batchelor, patent director at Novozymes. Even the Danish People's Party, which helped push for the vote, EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen acknowledges that the patent court is not a particularly popular issue. However, the surrender of sovereignty means that there is much at stake in principle, the party insists."
" I'm trying to make up for that now. It is well known that you disagree with the DF when it comes to the EU. But is it their and the public's EU scepticism that made you tone down your own EU policy? Obviously, those things are probably connected. The zeitgeist was critical of the EU."
" If Brexit negotiations come at the expense of the European economy, leaders will notice. Rising unemployment caused by wrangling over the future of the already unpopular EU brings election success closer for eurosceptics such as the PVV, Alternative für Deutschland and the Front National, May wants to say without being explicit.She herself knows very well the power of populism."
" If Britain votes for Brexit, and if there is then a referendum in Denmark, it could quickly become 'Dexit' too, said Nigel Farage in an interview with Politiken at the weekend. But the Danish People's Party does not want Denmark to leave the EU. Not even if the British leave. The DF's plan is more complicated than that. Kristian Thulesen Dahl is betting that there will be a change of power in London after a no vote, and that a new prime minister will try to stay close to the EU on different terms."
" If Europe changes, Italians will also be more pro-European. Having seen the outcome of the Brexit, has the League therefore dismissed the idea of a referendum? In my opinion, there is no need to leave the euro at this time."
 If Fianna Fáil recovers ground it will be in middle-class and rural Ireland. Sinn Féin s rise in the polls has been helped by its strong anti-EU line. The party s growing working-class base coincides with the areas where anti-EU feeling is strongest.
" If Germany, the engine and the credit card of the Union, turns away from the European project, there will be no project left.' Why, one negotiator asks, is the Netherlands, which benefits so much from the EU, turning more and more away from it? No one in Brussels has failed to notice that the three largest political parties in the polls are rabidly anti-European (PVV, SP) or increasingly Eurosceptic (VVD). The teasing VVD election slogan towards European soccer champion Spain ('They can have that cup."
" If Italy is now paying an even higher debt burden on Spain than it was paying on Germany 13 months ago, it is also due to these fears of exit that are once again stirring. None of this means that the hostility of the League and M5S toward Brussels and the threat of EU proceedings put the country on a slippery slope. This game is not being won by the small group of parliamentarians fixated on a return to the 1970s and 1980s, when there was the lira, inflation galloped in double digits and the debt doubled every decade."
" If Jaroslaw Kaczynski could be in the European Union, and at the same time receive structural funds, be in the common market and respect the rule of law, there would be no problem with post-lexit. Many of PiS's conversations in the EU, including those with the head of the office of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, were aimed at probing how much PiS could count on the EU's indifference to the erosion of rule of law in Poland. It turned out that it could not count on this at all. The EU decided that it could not allow itself to be influenced by Poland's rule of law because it would erode and undermine the foundations on which the Union is based."
" If Pablo Iglesias had already been censuring for weeks each of the decisions taken by Mariano Rajoy to enforce the Constitution, now the leader of Podemos wants to take advantage of the police charges of 1-O to extend his strategy of attrition to the PP outside Spain. Yesterday, the Podemos delegation in the European Parliament promoted before the Community institutions that the European Union sanction Spain by applying, including the article that would make it lose for an indefinite period of time the right to vote in the Council, the body that brings together all the Member States. Podemos' reaction to 1-O is to revolt with even more virulence against Rajoy, whom it considers the intellectual author of the police charges, in order to force his resignation."
" If a fourth mandate holder can be found alongside Harald Dobernig, Dörfler could even open his own club. Thematically, the Strache FPÖ wants to remain true to its three major themes: Asylum abuse, EU criticism and social policy. In the case of the former, the intention is to differentiate more strongly between those who deserve asylum and those who are purely economic refugees."
" If it served to reduce immigrants, Salvini would not hesitate to blow up the European Union. The League has a vision of the world and an ideology, sovereignism; it therefore has a network of international connections, from Putin to Le Pen. The League has a leader, or rather a captain, it moves like a Macedonian phalanx and razes the currents to the ground. All the instrumentation of the vituperative politics, which they said was dead and buried, in the League is put at the service of a policy."
" If it's not interference, it's certainly a diplomatic blunder. Also because in the same hours the M5S tries to keep up its neutralism towards the Venezuelan regime of Maduro, thundering against the interference of the U.S. and EU. These are difficult balances to keep, being on a collision course with the League. Salvini is extremely harsh against Maduro."
" If not D66. Party leader Pechtold thinks the separation should be initiated immediately: No more dozing off. That is precisely the problem with the European Union. In the Lower House, the enthusiasm for a 'Nexit' is not great. Apart from the PVV (12 seats), only the Bontes/Van Klaveren Group (2 seats) is in favor of leaving the EU. The euro-critical SP also does not believe that the Netherlands should leave the Union."
" If one were to look inside the rating, alongside the risks - in the case of Italy, all of a political nature - highlighted in the first lines, the general picture would appear much less bleak. Moody's recognizes that the League and M5S have no plans to exit the euro in their program; that EU rules will contain adventurism; that the risk of a liquidity crisis is very low; that the economy is growing, driven by exports; that companies have little debt and families are wealthy. But how many get to read to the last line?"
" If part of the government opts out of it, that is not helpful. Added to this is the scandalous situation that the FPÖ is part of a group that wants to destroy the common Europe. This has never happened before during an EU Council Presidency. The FPÖ must get out of this group."
" If someone wanted to attack Austria, it would not be enough to simply refer to neutrality. Griss also has a story to tell on the subject of the EU - of which the FPÖ is critical. At the Christmas party of one of her godchildren, she said, everyone had to tell what Christmas meant."
" If the Renaissance list comes behind the RN, what consequences will this have on French politics? We have become complacent, as if we had not realised that five years ago the party that won the European elections was the National Front. Did they succeed at the European level? They have voted against everything that is in the interest of France."
" If the euro was positive for France, after all, I would be happy with the euro, but I consider that it continues to be negative. While the FN has long advocated leaving the EU and the euro, Marine Le Pen once again asserts that she has heard what the French people told her during the presidential election. They expressed a fear, a concern."
" If the government has held up in the aftermath of the European elections, the pain will come in the fall. Lega and M5S believe that the new EU executive will be more lenient with Italy, without however taking into account that the new majority in Strasbourg will have to have within it the liberals, who are strong in the Nordic countries and tend to be conservative on issues of public finance. I'm afraid someone in Rome is deluding himself, explains a senior international official with frequent contacts in the halls of the Union."
" If the polls show that support for the Union has fallen below 60 percent. (it is currently over 80 percent), then PiS may decide to hold a referendum on leaving the EU.The yield on Polish 10-year Treasury bonds is currently 1.34 percent."
" If there are no effective controls and regular spot checks, traffickers may find that it is almost risk-free to transport people across the border to Denmark, he says. S-R-SF government dropped after the change of government in 2011 the plans to build control facilities at the Danish borders, which the UK government had agreed with the DF. Critics said the deal was in breach of EU rules, which do not allow permanent border controls.The Danish People's Party has also proposed that the penalty for human trafficking be increased so that traffickers can be sentenced to at least three years in prison and even longer sentences in particularly aggravated circumstances."
" If there is no deal, there must be a no-deal Brexit because of the democratic decision in the referendum. Complications may arise for your party in the European election campaign, as fundamental criticism of the EU is losing its appeal due to the Brexit process. What else is supposed to be the AfD's unique selling point?We want fundamental reforms of the EU so that there is no Dexit (Germany's exit from the EU)."
 If they don't want to reduce their political position to pure testimony. Should the League and Fratelli d'Italia retract their anti-EU positions? Today no one appreciates the EU as it is. And Macron has also been very critical of Brussels.
" If they don't, they face financial penalties. The same political arguments always sound in conversations with PiS politicians about the dispute with Brussels. The first, that the EU has no right to dictate to member states how to reform. As explained in Wyborcza lawyer prof."
" If things went optimally for them, even 27 per cent of the votes or up to 203 seats in parliament would be achievable. The study sees one of the greatest national potentials of all EU-sceptical groups in the FPÖ. Accordingly, it could receive between 26 and 42 per cent of the vote."
" If today the shelling of Brussels comes mainly from outside, from the national governments and people's representatives; after next month's elections the bullets will also come from inside, namely from the European Parliament. Due to expected large vote gains of the populist and Eurosceptic right, such as the French Front National, the British UKIP, the Dutch PVV and the Austrian FPÖ, the European Parliament (EP) will be more often critical of the European ideal. In the past, the EP always wanted 'More Europe' to be added to the plans of the European Commission, the daily administration of the EU, but now it will more often pull the brake and call for 'Less Europe'. The question is whether it is bad that the European ideal is out of the picture and has to make way for a more pragmatic attitude."
" If you add their family members, this reaches a dimension that even Heinz-Christian Strache cannot overlook - which is why the FPÖ leader has suddenly changed his line by 180 degrees. Only a year ago, Strache had again railed against the gigantic bureaucratic juggernaut and over-bureaucratisation: Why does Vienna have more civil servants than the EU? was the frequently voiced, vehement criticism of civil servants by the FPÖ. Now, before the election, all that is forgotten: No city employee would be dismissed under him as mayor, Strache declared, and had this highly official, including a notarised guarantee declaration, put up posters all over Vienna and even advertised (for cutting out) in newspapers."
" If you don't want paedophile rings to live, you can of course vote no, he made clear yesterday. DF is certainly not holding back either. The party's main argument is that the EU-friendly parties will use the agreement to lure us into the EU's immigration policy. With the agreement, future majorities in the Folketing will have the opportunity to bring additional areas, such as immigration policy, under the opt-in system."
" If you go into another election under these conditions, the anti-European push can only get stronger. If a government is made between M5s and League jumps the ceiling of 3% in the ratio between public deficit and GDP, the EU opens an infringement procedure, begins a bitter tug-of-war and grows the chorus of those who call for the exit from the euro. If the center-right governs, things will not change much: there will be no Italexit, but there will be a permanent guerrilla war between Rome and Brussels."
" If, in addition, a fee is charged for advice or help in filling out the form, fraudsters are at work. #NAME? The European Union is building ""increasingly undemocratic structures to an alarming degree"", said party leader Bernd Lucke on Saturday at the nationwide launch event in Cologne."
" If, in addition, a fee is charged for advice or help in filling out the form, fraudsters are at work. AfDRight-wing populists stir up opposition to EUWith sharp attacks on EU policies, the Euro-critical party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has opened the hot phase of its European election campaign. The European Union is building ""increasingly undemocratic structures to an alarming degree"", said party leader Bernd Lucke on Saturday at the nationwide launch event in Cologne."
" Imagining leaving the community of democracies to chase the most dangerous and bizarre sirens on the international scene is very similar to the devastating mistake made by Hugo Chavez when he came to power in Caracas in 1999 and chose Havana, La Paz and Tehran over Washington, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, London and Paris. The result is a Venezuela reduced to misery, where milk and medicines are in short supply. But there is more, because the temptation to break away from the EU and NATO on the part of the Cinquestelle - with the League often in the balance - closely evokes one of the worst defects of the First Republic or the temptation to make agreements, more or less under the table, with dictators and violent groups. This characteristic was common to the major parties of the time."
" In 2009, the ÖVP was still clearly the strongest force with 30 per cent and six mandates, ahead of the SPÖ with 23.7 per cent and five mandates. The FPÖ was behind with 12.2 per cent and two mandates. Against EU critics. Karas, like Sebastian Kurz once head of the Young ÖVP and later Secretary General of the party under Wolfgang Schüssel, is the black hopeful this time."
" In 2013, 25,494 children abroad received family allowance from Austria, compared to 24,498 in the previous year. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) have long been advocating that family allowances for children living in other EU countries should be based on the respective cost of living in the country concerned. In view of the budget problems and additional necessary expenditures for asylum, this would lead to savings in Austria."
" In 2016, the United Kingdom decided to leave the EU; in the United States, a President hostile to European integration was elected for the first time, with ambiguous relations with the Russian President but clearly aligned with him on this hostility; supporter and perhaps financier of sovereignist movements, themselves hostile to the EU, in some European countries. In one large member state, Italy, in 2018 two parties then both sovereignist and then both hostile to the EU (M5S and Lega), won elections and went into government. At least one of those two parties (Lega), and for a year the Italian government itself, viewed favorably the populist governments of Hungary and Poland.Today, Kaczynski's Poland and Orbán's Hungary find themselves perhaps a bit disoriented."
" In 2016, when the European Commission initiated a procedure against Poland for violating the rule of law, he said that &bdquo;the European Union is hypersensitive and the Commission's action has &bdquo;little legal basis. Mateusz Morawiecki's government started talking to EU institutions in a different language after the failure of the &bdquo;white paper in Brussels. The document prepared by the PiS government was supposed to explain to Europe why &bdquo;reform of the judiciary is necessary and in line with European law, but the &bdquo;white paper even infuriated several EU countries.PiS was then left only to add the word &bdquo;concessions to the European repertoire."
" In 2019, Poland was already the heart of Europe, and the sudden pro-European turn was summed up again by Andrzej Duda saying that Europe is us. After that election, when it became clear that PiS politicians were more marginalized in the new European Parliament than before, everything went back to normal. Since the autumn of 2019, hostility to the EU has been popular again, and in the spring of 2020 it became clear that Europe can do nothing in the event of a pandemic, and that everything good that happens is due to the national government.From the summer of 2020, we have a new situation."
" In Austria in 2013, as in 2006 and 2008, the Grand Coalition between the Social Democrats and the People's Party returned, although it was increasingly unsuccessful (the two parties barely reached 51% together). In Germany, negotiations are underway between Merkel and her long-time opponent, the SPD, for another Grand Coalition after the one of 2005. If a few years ago, as the leading scholar of populism, Paul Taggart, said, Euroscepticism was a characteristic limited to a few extremist parties (such as the Lega in Italy or Le Pen's party in France), just a touch of dissent, today the gulf that divides those who continue to trust the EU institutions and those who distance themselves from them is a structural element of European political systems. On the one hand the pro-European parties, on the other the anti-European ones."
" In EU countries, Europhobia is on the rise In May, one in five seats in the Strasbourg parliament could go to anti-European parties, such as the Front National in France or Ukip in the UK. Rather than converging on the essentials, as has been the case until now, the conservatives of the EPP and the social-democratic left of S&D could theoretically look for a majority boost by looking in opposite directions."
" In Europe, Cs is not an alternative to the PP, but to the PSOE. The alternative to a European PP president in the Commission is a socialist supported by Cs and Podemos, and that would be the first step to the end of the EU. The vote for Cs is equivalent to the left. Q.- Do you not foresee Cs overtaking the PP in any autonomous region or important municipality? A.- I would not like that to happen because Cs is not a real party."
" In February, projects in Italy and Hungary that could massively increase Russian influence in Europe caused a stir. It is no coincidence that Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orbán or Heinz-Christian Strache advocate an end to the EU's Russia sanctions.Strache's FPÖ, by the way, has concluded a cooperation agreement with Vladimir Putin's state party United Russia. Long before Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election with his nationalist slogans America first and Make America great again, in this country the FPÖ under the leadership of Jörg Haider initiated a referendum Austria first in 1992, which was supported by more than 400,000 people in early 1993."
" In France itself, Syriza's victory has been as well received by the far left as by the far-right National Front, a party whose essential objective is to take France out of the euro and reestablish its borders. Florian Philippot, vice-president of the FN clarifies that they do not intend to be allies of Syriza, but in the interest of the French people it is in our interest the debate that has been opened on austerity, on the euro and the EU itself.In the case of Italy, the two sensibilities have united in a single force, the 5 Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, which coincides with Podemos and Syriza in trying to destroy the economic policies of the EU and the euro, although its leader is unable to sit at the same table with a communist. Support from the Mayor of CadizFor his part, the Mayor of Cadiz, José María González Kichi, and his government team have sent a letter to Tsipras, in which he supports Sunday's referendum and in which he stands by the Greek Executive in this fight for a different Europe, the Europe of rights and social justice."
" In France too, Eurosceptics are growing wings - Mélenchon on the left and the FN on the other side of the spectrum are denouncing the European system. ""THE QUESTION Within the UMP, as within the PS in 2005 during the referendum on the European Constitution, the party is divided."
" In France, Emmanuel Macron entered the fray on Thursday, taking up his favourite dichotomy between With the expected success of Matteo Salvini's League in Italy, the possible score of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Germany, the National Rally remaining at a high level or the emergence of a far-right vote in Spain, the camp of those who blame Brussels for unbearable interference in national affairs is on the rise.The long unthinkable but now certain turnout of Britons at the polls and the assured success of Nigel Farage's Brexit party should also be mentioned."
" In France, nearly one in five voters supported Marine Le Pen and her 'leave the euro' policy. In the Netherlands, Mr Wilders may be looking forward to gaining more seats in parliament at the coming election.At home, Sinn Féin, the most eurosceptic party in the Dáil, is now the second most popular party in the country. From the podium of the European Commission press room, spokesmen every day look down their noses and speak in contempt about such 'populism'."
" In France, since 2010, the number of participants in the annual demonstration against abortion increased: from 15,000 in 2009 to 50,000 in 2017. In Germany, the admission of one million refugees in 2015 led to the rise of Pegida, which at its peak rallied 25,000 people. In the Netherlands, GeenPeil, Citizens' Committee EU and Forum for Democracy managed to mobilize citizens against the EU treaty with Ukraine in 2016 - a precursor to Thierry Baudet's political success.And then you had the yellow shirts (2018), which showed that discontent and protest need not have a clear political color."
" In France, the same constellation already existed at that time. And in Germany, too, politicians of the post-communist party Die Linke are sometimes very close to the AfD's criticism of the EU and immigration.In Southern Europe, where the euro crisis has paralysed entire economies or - example Greece - driven large parts of the population below the poverty line, a solid left populism has taken root."
" In Germany, for example, the future of 6,000 artificial turf pitches is at stake. Criticism of the EU's planned approach came from the FPÖ. Dietrich Kops, sports spokesman for the Vienna FPÖ, demanded an exemption and asked the federal government to become active with the responsible EU agencies. The 50 artificial turf pitches in Vienna are mostly played on by smaller clubs."
" In Ireland, it's about EUR 39,000 - and still EUR 16,000 less than the EUR 55,000 MEPs receive to fund a constituency office. At a time when the EU is under microscopic scrutiny, it's a spectacular and corrosive own goal. Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy described the European Parliament governing body's decision on transparency as scandalous and defying logic, making the obvious point that MEPs' credibility in demanding accountability on EU spending may be undermined by their own practices. No doubt, when asked, he and every MEP supports the idea of transparency and proper vouching systems."
" In Italy, in support of Europe are declaredly the list of Emma Bonino, +Europa, and the Pd of Nicola Zingaretti, as incorporating in the symbol the movement (admittedly qualifiable as such) Siamo europei, by Carlo Calenda. The other formations can, at most, express a detachment from Europe without declaring themselves against (Fi), or profess populism and sovereignism (Lega, M5s, Fratelli d'Italia). If an EU supporter proclaims Come and vote!, he risks increasing hostile positions, instead of favorable ones. The discourse changes little if we consider that almost all voters at the European elections have always expressed themselves looking at national politics. It is certain that interest in European politics will grow this time, but it is more likely to be against than for."
" In January, the Administrative Court agreed with the ECJ ruling. Because of the association agreement with Turkey, the laws on aliens may not be applied to Turks since Austria's accession to the EU. The ÖVP, SPÖ and FPÖ are worried. This is not good news for Austria, said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner."
" In May, Bolsonaro had lost 9 points in relation to January, dropping below 40%. Is the European Union acting as a factor of political stability and, in a certain way, immunizing its governments against the Covid-19 crisis? Are the stimuli agreed by Merkel and Macron the vaccine that we did not have in the 2008 crisis? Does the slight decline of parties traditionally critical of the European Union, such as the communists in Portugal, the Lega in Italy, Podemos and Vox in Spain, respond to this economic response? We have no certainties.. Just questions that, perhaps, we will be able to answer in a few months. Antonio Asencio is Director of Strategy and Communication at Sigma Dos."
" In Spain Podemos collapsed, Vox downsized, and it's back to the alternative between socialists and populars. In Italy the neo-nationalist League now supports the most pro-European of governments. In France Marine Le Pen is deflating. And in Germany Merkel's party yields not to the right (Alternative für Deutschland loses votes and seats) but to the center, where the liberals strengthen on one side and the Greens and Social Democrats on the other."
" In Vienna, they are coalition partners in this respect and are bound by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. But in the European Parliament, the FPÖ members of the ENF group continue to oppose common European solutions. They even vote against things in the Group that they support in Austria, such as stronger protection of the EU's external borders by Frontex,"" Karas explained. The FPÖ shows a completely different face in Strasbourg and Brussels than in Austria.The ÖVP MP is particularly harsh on Vilimsky: ""If the FPÖ were not a member of the ENF parliamentary group, we would of course have an easier time."
" In a cross-border study involving researchers from Griffith University in Brisbane, Heinisch evaluated all of Strache's public speeches concerning the EU over the past four years - a total of 549 statements were examined. The preliminary result of the study, which was presented at a conference in the USA a few weeks ago but has not yet been published: In terms of the intensity of criticism, the FPÖ hardly differs from its openly anti-EU group colleagues in the European Parliament. According to this, 91.6 per cent of all statements on Europe made by FPÖ leader Strache in the period from 2013 to 2017 were clearly negative in nature."
" In a hypothetical party model, up to one in four voters could vote for an extremist party: its platform would stop immigration, give priority to Finnish culture, make foreign believers adapt to Finnish ways and give Finnish workers priority in jobs. If necessary, we will also leave the EU.Talk of a surprisingly widely supported extremist nationalism: in Finland, the Finns and in the West, the Sweden Democrats represent nativist populism in the same way as, for example, the French National Front.Nativist, nationalist populism has a negative attitude towards immigration and globalisation."
" In a recent CSA study for BFMTV and the Nice-Matin Group, only 51% of French people say they are in favour of France joining the Union and 38% are sceptical. This scepticism is most evident in the least privileged categories... They are also found in the majority of the Front de gauche and the Front national. Among the radical left, 46% of respondents think that membership of the European Union is a bad thing, compared with 37% who think it is a good thing. For them, the enemy is finance."
" In a statement to DF chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl from 10 October last year with the subject ' As agreed :-)' she warns of problems with the use of money and the accounts. I need you to take full responsibility for this account or have it investigated, so that I am sure that the right action is taken in this case, Rikke Karlsson wrote and noted in the same e-mail, which DR has access to, that she did not want to be cross: I support 100 percent that we must of course use ALL the opportunities we have in the Danish People's Party to get all the EU funds that are possible to get, to help our party. In itself, there is nothing sinister about receiving EU funding."
" In a ten-part series, we report about - and above all against - Brussels. The contributions on FPÖ-TV also come from Andreas Mölzer, FPÖ MEP, among others. Mölzer also repeatedly writes for unzensuriert.at - an online platform founded by the liberal Third National Council President Martin Graf."
" In about 40% of the projects, the Court of Auditors discovered serious errors, which impaired fair competition and led to the award of contracts to others than the best bidders.Rightly so, the Europarliament from the Christian Democrats to the PVV is flying in the curtains. This is fraud of unprecedented proportions, says PVV MEP Olaf Stuger. He immediately wants all the money that the Netherlands has put into that EU pot back, the Court of Auditors believes that if the situation has not improved by the end of 2016, payments to the member states concerned should be suspended until 2020.The Court of Auditors visited the Czech Republic, Spain and Italy, among others, and found serious irregularities. Just the countries that complain about the cost of refugee reception."
" In addition to Strache, Ministers Norbert Hofer and Beate Hartinger-Klein were also VIP guests at the Glocks. The FPÖ has always pursued a pro-gun policy and fought an EU directive with stricter markings and restrictions. Kathrin Glock moved into the supervisory board of the aviation authority Austro Control, which is part of Hofer's Ministry of Transport."
" In addition, the President of the National Council, Doris Bures (SPÖ), can in future also invite outstanding personalities of European and international politics to make statements, to which MEPs may then also make donations of words. The red-black-green trio hopes that this will lead to better interaction between the European Parliament and the National Council as well as to more quality in European policy debates. The Neos did not react enthusiastically to being left out alongside the EU-sceptical FPÖ. The government is missing opportunities to find a solution with pro-European forces,"" said Angelika Mlinar, MEP."
" In addition, the informal power used by the Quirinale is difficult to use in the context of the gap between the dominant political sensibility and the institution itself. Secondly, the words of Grillo, a sui generis figure but precisely for this reason free to go where others cannot, are read as a possible anticipation of the phase that will open in the aftermath of the European elections in May 2019. Until then, the glue that holds the League and M5S together will undoubtedly be represented by the confrontation with the EU and its bureaucracies. After that, especially in case of a sovereignist outcome, it could move on from an offensive at the Quirinale."
" In all likelihood, the German Chancellor also thinks this is a nonsense. Kurz always asks that his government with the anti-EU partner FPÖ be judged by its deeds. Merkel said coolly: We are watching this."
" In almost all member states, extremists, populists and Eurosceptics captured seats from the classic middle parties. Only the Dutch PVV remains behind. Frans Boogaard and Deborah Jongejan Of the 751 seats, some 130 go to Europhobic parties in Brussels. That's more than double."
" In an interview with the press, Jörg Leichtfried, spokesperson for Europe of the SPÖ, demands a commitment from Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) to the European policy line of France, Germany, the Benelux countries and Sweden. At present, however, the ÖVP is doing exactly the opposite, abandoning its pro-European course and acting in a similarly populist manner as the FPÖ. As an example, Leichtfried cites the federal government's repeated demands to cut the EU budget. Instead of committing to reallocations in the community budget or making constructive proposals themselves, only savings in the administration would be demanded."
" In any case, a small business policy will have to be an integral part of the future sector policies that this country is urgently called upon to implement.A second sector that was very prominent in yesterday's events was agriculture. The crisis led to the end of a previous swaggering attitude (with the non-compliance with the milk quotas decided by the European Union and the refusal to pay the related fines) that had found strong support in the League. Now the farmers are complaining not so much about the ban on increasing quantity as about the excessively low prices paid by industries and wholesalers; they are putting themselves in a position of conflict with the distribution chain and the food industries much more than with the government."
" In any case, such a high investment in infrastructure would have to be compatible with the EU's overall budget. The reactions of the Austrian MEPs to the building considerations were divided yesterday, ranging from the demand for a detailed cost breakdown of all variants (Ulrike Lunacek, Greens), to parallel criticism of the spatial working conditions at the Strasbourg seat of the Parliament (Evelyn Regner, SPÖ), to total denial - the plans are a new perfidy of the EU, emphasised the FPÖ MEP Harald Vilimsky."
" In autumn, Europe itself could be on the agenda, fuelled by the UK's exit. Possibly - and it is not only the Greens who are speculating - the FPÖ has acquired a taste for it. At present, it is only in favour of Austria leaving the EU if Turkey joins. But in an election campaign, this position can change quickly."
" In both VVD and CDA there is plenty of discussion about the Europe course. The rise of the anti-European Forum for Democracy has made this issue especially sensitive. Brexit, the rise of China, the international buck-passing of Trump and Putin: the arguments in favor of European cooperation are there for the taking. At the same time, the fear of chasing away voters with an overly enthusiastic Europe narrative is still strong."
" In carnet there is a trip to Japan and then the one, which has been talked about for some time, to the United States, perhaps meeting Donald Trump with whom Salvini has in common an allergy to the establishment and political correctness. Guglielmo Picchi, former deputy elected abroad for Forza Italia and then moved to the League, is working on it.Even in Europe there is a new opportunity: the Brexit. For MEP Luca Fontana, ideologue of the Salvini League, Britain's exit from the EU would be proof that the European choice is not irreversible."
" In contrast to Haider, Strache brings few new proposals, he acts statically. Postscript: But he succeeds with it. Under him, the FPÖ consistently cultivates issues. Strache concentrates on asylum and foreigner issues, coupled with a generous portion of EU scepticism. Love. Recently, the FPÖ leader has also been appearing more statesmanlike. In television interviews he is calm and unagitated."
" In contrast to the billionaire, who also courted votes in the camp of angry opponents of the system and frustrated crisis losers, Strache always appeared well-considered. Despite his charity campaign, he offered, as always, everything his fans want to hear from him: no mercy for asylum cheats, no export of family benefits abroad, no more money for ailing EU states.Secretary General Harald Vilimsky declared the FPÖ the winner of the election early in the evening."
" In contrast to the rest of Europe, the social democrats of the PvdA won substantially and the anti-Europe mood diminished with the heavy defeat of PVV (minus four) and SP (minus two). The entrance of the Forum for Democracy, which presents itself as the anti-EU party, only partially compensates for this decline. Especially after the resounding success of Thierry Baudet's party in the State elections two months ago, the three seats gained are fewer than expected."
" In fact, by October 15 the governments, including Italy, must send their budget plans to Brussels, but it is very likely that an initial discussion on the strategies and general lines of next year's finances will be initiated during the informal meeting of the Ministers of the Economy, scheduled to take place in Luxembourg on September 11 and 12. Renzi's words triggered the criticism of the Secretary of the Northern League, Matteo Salvini: It is a play: the Prime Minister is the servant of what Merkel and Brussels decide and ridicules us because he is incapable of managing the problem of immigration. His party colleague Roberto Calderoli added: On December 16 we will celebrate the funeral of the Renzi government."
" In fact, it runs not only through Europe, but in Germany also right through the country, right through the political landscape - indeed right through the individual parties. On the part of those who understand Russia, there are loud calls for a new Ostpolitik, for the resumption of dialogue and the lifting of the EU sanctions imposed because of the annexation of Crimea, which was contrary to international law. The FPÖ and other right-wing and left-wing parties in Europe with good connections to Moscow have been insisting on this for a long time. But, writes Der Spiegel - and the camp critical of Putin's policy has been calling for this for a long time: The prerequisite for a new start, however, would be that Russia abandons the practice of misleading its partners through strategic lies. Strategic lies have become the hallmark of the Putin era."
" In fact, the figure is likely to be significantly lower: Fix, Riyadh has signed orders worth $14.5 billion of this volume so far. And Austria? At the end of October, Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl (FPÖ) called for an EU-wide stop to arms exports to Riyadh, saying that Vienna had not delivered any war material there since the beginning of the offensive in 2015."
" In fact, we have a substantial objection, because the proposal would put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage compared to today. Isn't the desire for a referendum rather an opportune way to reignite your EU scepticism? No, I could find more timely and sexy EU issues to vote on than the patent court. Messerschmidt insists that the Danish People's Party's criticism of the patent court is also substantial.-- The party warns against so-called 'forum shopping', which it says the new rules could lead to: that is, anyone who wants to challenge a patent can choose in which country to bring an action."
" In future elections, Greeks will be tempted to vote for Golden Dawn, which advocates leaving the euro and expelling immigrants. In the three largest countries of the European Union, this movement is gaining ground with the Front National in France, Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and Ukip in the United Kingdom (which wants to leave the Union altogether). If the small breeze of growth that is now carrying the continent does not last, if the governments do not quickly find effective ways of keeping the promise of Europe, then its enemies have a boulevard before them."
" In his recent book Politics and Crisis, the pollster Peter Ulram has proven that such populist demands do not lead to success in times of crisis. At the height of the crisis in 2009, the unemployed and those who feared a concrete deterioration of the economic situation turned away from the FPÖ.In general, the potential of EU sceptics in Austria has not really changed. One third (33 %) voted against EU accession in 1994."
" In its proposal, the party led by Santiago Abascal incorporates a package of measures, including the creation of the Coordination Commission immediately. . Vox also urged the Government to apply for the aid that the European Union Solidarity Fund offers to members for this type of natural disasters.0"
" In many member states we are facing a rapid growth of right-wing populist, anti-EU, sometimes even racist forces. Ukip wants Britain to leave the EU. The AfD thinks you can just kick a few euro states out of the monetary union. The Front National in France wants border controls back, withdrawal from Nato and an open rejection of anomalous modern art."
" In meetings in Brussels with members of his EPP party, he thus obtained broad and complete support. But from the PD came criticism of the attempt to give reassurances about the League's ally Matteo Salvini, who in Europe is associated with the Eurosceptic French Marine Le Pen. M5S and Greens attacked the president of the European Commission, Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker of the EPP, for meeting with Berlusconi as he was convicted of tax fraud and excluded from the Italian Parliament."
" In municipalities with Magna operations, the figure was significantly higher. However, Vukan is somewhat perplexed by the fact that two nationwide FPÖ themes in particular have resonated with workers and SPÖ sympathisers: the anti-EU line and the foreigner issue (this theme is there subliminally). These simple messages, with which the FPÖ works, such as paying less to the EU, go down particularly well with the population."
" In order to achieve this, i.e. to maximise the party votes, it sends its candidates into the race against each other: In the end, it is not the list of candidates drawn up by the party leadership that decides on the allocation of mandates, but the absolute number of preferential votes. A staged conflict between the pro-European Othmar Karas (ÖVP top candidate) and the EU critic Harald Vilimsky (FPÖ) had actually been agreed with the coalition partner. In addition, however, there is now a serious conflict about the demarcation of the FPÖ from its right-wing fringe (cue Identitarian movement)."
" In order to buy time, they drafted a draft that takes into account the positions they considered to be indispensable. In the case of the League: cancellation of the Fornero law, defense of the borders and new protagonism in the EU. Just yesterday Berlusconi pulled a new rabbit out of the hat: less taxes for those who own pets, in addition to total relief for hiring young people, increases in minimum pensions and the income of dignity (below the threshold of one thousand euros the state intervenes to support)."

" In other words, the next Executive must commit to tackling the deficit in accordance with the commitments made with Brussels and continue to address the structural reforms that are still pending. All this, in accordance with the economic principles that govern the European Union. These ideas are incompatible with the program and economic postulates defended by Podemos. There is consensus in the economic, financial and business circles that it would be desirable for a government to be formed before May 2 as a result of the agreement between PP and PSOE and Ciudadanos."
" In our case, it forced the reform of labor relations, and demanded constitutional changes to which both popular and socialist parties agreed, accepting the prevalence of the market over people. The EU is bullying us. According to my British colleague, it is worried about the danger of what Podemos might achieve in Spain, the Eurosceptics in Italy or the National Front in France, if Syriza gets its way. He wonders if Podemos can be defeated by crushing Tsipras, or can it discourage Le Pen by violating the sovereignty and sensibility of a nation."
" In our opinion, Vox is a party that intends to break the constitutional consensus by proposing the suppression of the regional parliaments and, logically, of the autonomous communities, thus altering one of the foundations of our political order. And that in the European framework it has allied itself with the Visegrad countries, the least committed to European integration although none of them has asked to leave the EU as the very democratic Great Britain has done and consummated. On the other hand, Vox is not known for violent actions or connections with groups of young people dressed in threatening belts and high boots. Those who have broken, tearing it apart, the constitutional consensus are the Catalan separatists in their various sensibilities; and they have done it in the roughest way possible: by staging a coup d'état against Spain and its democratic institutions."
" In particular, Malta's plans to issue a full citizenship are causing a furore and adding to the heated debate about whether EU citizens are entitled to welfare benefits in other Member States. Even though wealthy foreigners with millions in their bank accounts hardly need cash assistance, the child cheque, for example, is also granted to rich families, points out EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen from the Danish People's Party.I do not want other countries to interfere in the rules for citizenship.-- but it seems to me that the EU is turning a blind eye to the problems that can arise from free movement, precisely when there are such mechanisms at work, she says."
" In practical terms, it would mean that the British would have to adopt the same tariff policy towards third countries as the EU, whereas they would prefer to regulate this themselves. Nexit Lower House rejects PVV motion for Dutch EU referendum The Lower House voted overwhelmingly against a motion on Tuesday calling on the cabinet to do everything possible to hold a referendum on Dutch EU membership as soon as possible. PVV leader Wilders had submitted the motion. By roll call vote, the motion was defeated by 124 votes to 14."
" In praise of borders LET TERS THE talk is of a 'hard border' between the Republic and Northern Ireland when Brexit kicks in. Sinn Féin, in particular, is being very negative and hinting at all manner of mayhem if it becomes a reality. What should happen, of course, is that Ireland as a whole joins with Britain in its new enterprise of real freedom, and give the failed EU the old heave-ho."
" In reality, Vox's real Italian partner is Fratelli d'Italia, a small party heir to Gianfranco Fini's National Alliance. Among other things, Vox is distinguished from France's Marine Le Pen by its excessive statehood, as opposed to the Spanish party's economic ultraliberalism.Vox sources recognize that it is possible to articulate a common program with these groups based on some shared principles: vindication of the sovereignty of the States, as opposed to what they consider a federalist drift of the Union; strict control of borders, rejecting the imposition of quotas and leaving it up to each country to decide which immigrants it accepts; and opposition to any attempt at tax harmonization."
" In recent years, however, this has begun to break down, as Poland's ruling Law and Justice party has made the EU the main threat to Poles' national independence and security, especially from the Germans, who, according to Law and Justice, are dangerous to us. And this has become, besides the defense against refugees, the main asset of PiS before the next elections in Poland. Fear-mongering and defense against the domination of the EU and EU law are a valuable scarecrow and the main argument to keep PiS's waning public support and power in Poland.You can admire this cold, thoughtful, but risky and threatening game."
" In response to a corresponding poll by the Austria Press Agency among the top candidates, ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz stated that there must be no new taxes that would lead to an additional burden on the Austrian taxpayer. The APA wanted to know whether the party leaders would find it sensible for the EU to levy taxes itself in future instead of collecting membership fees from the states.FPÖ Chairman Heinz-Christian Strache does not want to shake the tax sovereignty of the member states under any circumstances: We are against EU taxes. NEOS leader Matthias Strolz is moderately positive about the tax idea. A clear yes to more EU own resources comes from the Green Party's top candidate Ulrike Lunacek."
" In response to accusations that he was copying the FPÖ's policy on foreigners, Sebastian Kurz replied literally: ""I am clearly pro-European, I try to address problems, to propose solutions. The FPÖ is a party that is destructive, fundamentally thinks little of the EU and thus does not commit itself to European solutions. With the FPÖ, I always have the feeling that they address problems solely to placard them, but without any will to solve them."
" In search of a political home, he later briefly joined the FDP, but was quickly disgusted. Then a party is founded that wants to abolish the Renewable Energy Sources Act, which pleases the physics teacher: On 7 March 2013, Blex joins the young AfD, quickly becomes chairman in the district of Warendorf near Münster and immediately wants to ban the EU flag from the district council.In the state election campaign, Blex plans the next school lessons in the morning, and the overthrow of the system in the afternoon."
" In search of alliances to weigh in the European Parliament With some 140 seats in the European Parliament, Euroscepticism has never been in better shape: the parties that reject the EU have doubled their number of seats in Strasbourg. But as soon as this victory is celebrated, from the FN in Paris to the FPÖ in Vienna and the Ukip in Southampton, it is time to start negotiating to form a political group in the European Parliament. This requires a minimum of 25 MEPs from seven different countries."
" In short, none of them includes in the program how to redirect the public accounts despite the fact that all of them say they will comply with Brussels. While Podemos advocates leaving the deficit at 2% of GDP, and not abolishing it as the EU wants.Another lever is structural reforms to improve productivity, combat unemployment and precariousness."
" In short: to gain support from the Court it controls in its fight against EU institutions. It is sad because as a member of the EU we should support these institutions, not fight with them. Meanwhile, the PiS government will be able to argue in the case pending before the CJEU that it acted internally in accordance with the constitution, because the CJK ruled that way. If, despite this, the Court of Justice rules that Poland acted illegally, PiS will accuse the EU of disregarding Polish law."
" In terms of positions, this is partly true. FVD, VNL and PVV are Islam-critical, anti-euro, against further expansion of the EU, against the Ukraine treaty and for a brake on immigration from the Middle East. Each of these parties is trying to offer an alternative to the Hague party cartel that handed us over to an overexpansive European Union with leaky borders and a weak euro."
" In that case, the government will need at least the support of the Coalition Party behind it. The Finns are likely to go all out to raise their profile in the run-up to the municipal elections, but the EU's stimulus package is unlikely to fall on that.Tuoree's survey shows that for Finns, the EU is not just a money-distribution machine or a transfer union."
" In that year, the euro crisis reached its peak. The German government contributed billions to keep Greece in the EU. This seemed wrong to Lucke and the future AfD founders. When Lücke's idea of entering the Lower Saxony state parliament in January 2013 on the Free Voters' list failed, the circle of Euro-opponents decided to build their own party."
" In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, the FPÖ's criticism of the existing corporatist party state intensified the dissatisfaction of citizens, and in doing so it also laid the foundation for the crisis of democracy that can currently be perceived. At present, criticism of the EU and its apparent automatisms is conspicuous in all three populist groupings - FPÖ, BZÖ and Team Stronach. These groups additionally exploit the powerlessness of governments to act according to the supposed will of the electorate."
" In the Dáil, Taoiseach Micheál Martin hailed the deal as an unprecedented breakthrough which would see, he said, the EU collectively borrowing for the first time. However, the agreement on the EU budget, which will see the overall size of the fund for the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reduced as a result of the UK ceasing its contribution after Brexit, was criticised by Sinn Féin and other Opposition TDs.But Mr Martin insisted Irish farmers would be protected, and said the special EUR 5 billion fund for countries affected by Brexit would yield significant resources for Ireland."
" In the European Parliament, FPÖ MEPs have rejected infringement proceedings against these countries. @JV Less, but more efficient EU. The commitment of the ÖVP and FPÖ to an EU that regulates fewer issues but cooperates more efficiently in the currently most important areas allows room for interpretation. Nevertheless, challenges await the FPÖ."
" In the European elections, the anti-EU Ukip became the strongest force with 27.5 per cent. And this despite the fact that the other parties in the UK - with the exception of the Liberal Democrats - are also about as EU-friendly as the German AfD.Britain and the EU, they are like a couple who make each other miserable and yet shy away from the consequences."
" In the March plenary session of the EU Parliament alone, there was not a single agreement between the ÖVP and the FPÖ in the vote on important EU decisions ranging from regional funding to Brexit to the uniform corporate tax base. In many votes, the FPÖ MEPs vote against reforms of the EU or abstain when it comes to problem solving and even more efficiency in those issues that should actually be close to their hearts, such as uniform identity papers for rejected asylum seekers or an expansion of external border protection.Differences in freedom of movement."
" In the Netherlands, the party that most strongly opposes Europe is virtually the largest again. The PVV is our extended middle finger to Brussels. And yet we don't tolerate it when the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, says fuck the EU."
" In the UK, former Labour EU minister Denis MacShane eagerly awaits the outcome of the Danish vote and also notes the growing cross-border cooperation on terrorism. After the terrorist attack in Paris, it will seem a bit crazy if Denmark does not participate in, for example, the European Arrest Warrant, says Denis Mac-Shane, who has only sarcasm for the attitude of the Danish People's Party and other no parties: Mr Messerschmidt is welcome to go down to Molenbeek in Brussels to have a nice chat with the Islamic terrorists who are preparing the next attack and tell them: Please stay within the borders of any EU country.Denmark will eventually leave the judicial cooperation in the EU, because it was decided with the Lisbon Treaty that the cooperation in the future will be supranational instead of intergovernmental."
" In the autumn, Dupont-Aignan contributed to the creation of the Amoureux de la France platform, which was joined by the president of the PCD, Jean-Frédéric Poisson, and the president of the CNIP, Bruno North. The three presented a draft common programme for the European elections on Monday, and Le Pen published her letter on the same day that MEP and economist Bernard Monot announced his departure from the FN, mainly because of disagreements over the euro.The FN, which supported an immediate exit from the euro during the presidential campaign, now believes that leaving the single currency is no longer a priority."
" In the bourgeois camp, the rise of the DF has been viewed with envy. So when the leader of the Liberal Party, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, talks about strawberry pickers and the Conservatives about grasshoppers, when the debate is about Eastern workers, they have really looked at the fact that there are votes in EU scepticism.Despite the good measurements, the Danish People's Party has no need to show off its success.On the contrary."
" In the course of the military conflict between the People's Liberation Front (TPLF) ruling in Tigray and the Ethiopian central government, rockets had repeatedly been fired at neighbouring Eritrea. The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, met FPÖ leader Norbert Hofer in Vienna on Friday. Hofer congratulated Hungary on its resistance in terms of rule of law control at the EU summit and warned against an EU dictatorship of refugee sharing. The day before, Szijjártó had met the Dutch right-wing populist Geert Wilders as well as the leaders of Danish and Finnish parties of the same orientation."
" In the current survey, the declared supporters of the SPÖ, the Greens and the Neos are clearly more determined to go to the polls than the supporters of the governing parties - apparently not much mobilisation has happened yet with the Freedom Party, says Market Institute Director David Pfarrhofer. This is why declared FPÖ voters are highly inclined to say that the EU is developing in the wrong direction. Eight out of ten libertarians think so, only every tenth libertarian sees a positive development."
" In the debate in the National Council on 9 May In April 2008, Heinz-Christian Strache, at that time still the leader of the FPÖ, went into rhetorical overdrive. The EU Treaty of Lisbon, which was about to be ratified, was a European constitutional dictate, an attack on the Austrian constitution and, moreover, an attack on our Austrian democracy. The FPÖ demanded that the Republic should not accept it without a referendum and even took the matter to the Constitutional Court."
" In the debate on working Sundays, the leader of the PS MPs considers that the essential thing is to know in which zones, to respond to which demands and with what protection for employees. FLORIAN PHILIPPOT (FN). The vice-president of the FN sees there a succession of applications of what the EU wants: a generalized big bang and nothing in the background to relaunch growth, activity, employment. As for Sunday work, the FN is in favour of the current balance [ ] it is a choice of society, a man or a woman is not, every day that God makes, a consumer or a producer."
" In the debate, it was clear that both the former and current government parties want Denmark to be at the heart of the EU. The Danish People's Party does not share this view, but Kristian Thulesen Dahl nevertheless believes that it is perfectly possible to agree with the Left on some formulations on EU policy in a joint government basis. The DF's demand would be referendums if two different types of issues arise. Of course you can formulate something common."
" In the debates so far, Vilimsky therefore presented himself as a government candidate, while he insinuated that Karas was basically part of the opposition with his demands. In this way, ÖVP sympathisers who are critical of the EU are to be won over to the FPÖ. But the Turks don't really care what the Freedom Party wants at the moment."
" In the face of these tones, Europe's governments are now faced with the task of extinguishing in time the fuse of a political explosive device that the British have lit. For the first time, there is an official reversal of the integration process in the EU.With the German right-wing populists of the AfD, the reaction was more mixed. Alexander Gauland regretted the Brexit."
" In the meantime, it depends on the goodwill of the other countries. Therefore, 'plan B' of the DF is a limited application of the opt-in system, where powers are transferred to the EU in a specific area such as police cooperation Europol, while sovereignty in the other areas of EU legal policy is retained in Denmark. In this way, the 'no' parties will ensure that further devolution of powers can only take place through new referendums."
" In the name of vote-fishing, the Danish parties have come to look more and more alike, turning our politicians into wimps afraid to choose and prioritise, especially on the big, crucial issues like immigration and EU policy; relentlessly sniffing the smoke of popular sentiment, shying away from championing a view they fear clashes with that of the majority. BUT WHAT is the concept of popularity, DF operates with? Can it really be tossed about and used as the DF sees fit? Can one really afford to assume that popularity always equals the lowest common denominator and a fondness for the past and a rejection of what has never been seen before? And is there any perspective in leaning on such a concept of popularity when it comes to cultural policy? The Danish People's Party has over the years successfully pursued the policy that 'the people' want less EU and more Denmark, and it has been very successful in doing so, not least in relation to the other parties' relationship with the EU. Anders Fogh Rasmussen's renunciation of experts and judges in the 2002 New Year's speech did nothing for respect for professionalism and expertise in this country."
" In the near future, the Minister will convene the parliamentary parties individually. She needs the mandates of either the Danish People's Party or Enhedslisten, but is unlikely to get them. EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen (DF) wants a referendum on principle. I have nothing against the EU Patent Court."
" In the office The FPÖ and BZÖ have so far been reluctant to accept the protective shield - in which the country is to participate with 2.23 billion in cash and 17.3 billion in guarantees. The necessary amendment of Article 136 in the EU Treaty must be passed in the National Council by 1 January. A two-thirds majority, i.e. the consent of an opposition party, is required for the election on 1 January 2013."
" In the opinion of Steinberg, who participated in a conference at the Menéndez Pelayo International University of Santander, both formations do not want to break Europe, but a new Europe. On the contrary, the expert called to invite to leave the EU Europhobic parties such as Marine Le Pen's National Front or the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). While parties such as Podemos and Syriza want a new Europe, the researcher argued that the Europhobes seek to break Europe, leave the euro and build barriers at its borders. For Steinberg, one of the challenges facing the Union is to curb the rise of Euroscepticism and anti-Europeanism as a result of the management of the economic crisis and austerity policies."
" In the other countries, the elected representatives handle the matter themselves. I am well aware that this is not a very popular issue, says EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen (DF), referring to the fact that almost only companies are involved in patents. The emotions lie in the question of us giving up sovereignty, she adds."
" In the two weeks leading up to the vote, Emmanuel Macron spoke every day, everywhere, about everything. From the Rassemblement national to denounce its record in Brussels, from the environment by organising its first ecological defence council at the Élysée, from Europe by granting an interview to the regional press... Two hours before the official end of the campaign, he was still talking in an interview on a YouTube channel"
" In theory, Poland is in danger of having its voting rights in the European Council revoked. The Law and Justice (PiS) government has been announcing for two weeks that it will come out in front of the EU and withdraw from some of the criticized provisions. However, the announcements (which have not yet been written into any bill) suggest that these are apparent concessions: e.g."
" In this respect, those who want to replay the game of 2017 or make this election a referendum on the action of the majority, the government and the President of the Republic are not up to the challenge. By not having any ambition for Europe, national politicians from both the right and the left opened a boulevard for the National Front in the 2014 European elections. We have seen the result, five years later: Europe is on the brink.Finally by proposing a new method."
" In this way, everyone can make a contribution. Weinzierl hopes that in 2050, in addition to cash, which is important for the private sphere, Christian values will still exist in Austria and that it will no longer be a problem to come out as a Freedom Party member at school or university. The young FPÖ politician is convinced that programming training should not be missing. On the subject of the EU, he is not sure whether the EU can continue to exist as it is. Because he appreciates the economic idea, however, the institution is important in order to hold its own economically against other major powers. With the exception of resource-rich Norway, Weinzierl sees no new candidates for membership."
" In this way, the federal government wants to prevent further courts from imposing driving bans in cities. Parliamentarians fear that the diesel mess could become a popular campaign issue for EU-critical parties like the AfD before the European elections in May.."
" In total they make 255 points, equivalent to the spread between Btp and Bund. While the first risk has remained stable since May, likely to worsen with a longer-than-expected recession, the second could explode if the government's hostility towards the euro and the European Union were to intensify. Therefore, a new government majority in the League's traction would not be entirely reassuring, although the exit of the 5Stelle would suggest a greater awareness of economic issues. A government crisis and the prospect of a center-right majority would push the spread below 200, notes Gianluca Bolengo of Intermonte, emphasizing that any other scenario is better than the current one."
" In total, Haselsteiner's anti-Hofer campaign plans two waves plus a final motif. This week, for example, there will also be warnings of bankruptcies, farmers dying and a slump in tourism if Hofer leaves the EU. FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl declared that this was a completely insubstantial and populist fear campaign, which was nonsense in terms of content. Because Norbert Hofer had repeatedly declared that he was not aiming for an Öxit."
" In total, the Union fought over almost two trillion euros. This politically interesting event should be of interest to Austria's parties on their official homepages, right? Those who searched the internet for guidance on this essential question about the future of the EU from the ÖVP, SPÖ, FPÖ, Greens and Neos found little help. The summit did not take place there until Saturday."
" In two thirds of the EU Member States, Europhobic parties are sending members to the European Parliament. THE thunderclap caused by the Front National's victory in the European elections on 25 May has found an echo chamber in two thirds of the EU Member States.. Firstly in the UK, where the sovereignist Ukip party of"
" Inclusion would be possible if the funds were used well instead of wasting them as happened in Rome with Mafia Capital. Giancarlo Perego, the director general of the Migrantes Foundation, responded to Salvini by recalling how in the Senate Commission only the Northern League voted against the integration projects requested by the European Union. Even in light of this choice in the Senate in favor of the current camps, the prelate concluded, those of Salvini sound like words in freedom, totally senseless."
" Indeed, to extremist, pauperist and irresponsible parties. He refers to the Cricketers, but in Brussels the Eurosceptic face is also that of the League. Very veiledly, the president of the EPP, Joseph Daul, pointed it out in his speech at the end of the lunch. Daul is investing heavily in Berlusconi's rapprochement with the popular family, aided by the work of Antonio Tajani."
" Independents, we know, got 90% of the vote, but that was a mere 42% of the voters. The government in Madrid immediately declared this vote null and void, the government in Barcelona confirmed its validity, the European government has yet to decide, although it is known with certainty that it is for the no vote. The governments of the other regions of Europe are overwhelmingly hostile because if the Catalan example were to spread, it would put the institutions in Belgium between Flemish and Walloons, in what remains of Great Britain between English and Scottish, and perhaps even encourage the Italian League. Not to mention the intransigent hostility of the Brussels bureaucracy, the Strasbourg Parliament and various judicial powers. Madrid prohibits, the government in Barcelona goes ahead anyway, the Spanish try to hinder the participation in the polls and sends the army."
" Indirectly, the topic of immigration is nevertheless addressed. But the other core issues of the FPÖ can also be found on the smaller motifs: We are cutting our EU contributions - SPÖVP care and family allowance and We are lowering rents, taxes and fees - SPÖVP wages & pensions can be read on them. In this way, the Freedom Party is focusing on its core electorate, just as the SPÖ and ÖVP do on their posters."
" Ineffective lawsuit against fiscal pact FPÖ, BZÖ and Greens challenge Austria's participation in the EU austerity package at the Constitutional Court.[VIENNA/WB] Some want to take action against the austerity pressure of the EU, others against any shift of competences towards community institutions: Although their goals are completely different, the Greens, the FPÖ and the BZÖ jointly submitted a constitutional complaint against the Fiscal Compact on Friday."
" Instead, a large share of the vote is going to sceptical parties on the extreme left, which look set to significantly increase their presence in the European Parliament. FROM THE Danish People's Party to Britain's UK Independence Party and France's Front National.Yet sceptics will be watching from the sidelines as the EU commission presidency is filled in a historic power play between the parliament and heads of state and government."
" Instead, he said, there was a call for a fundamental reform of the Union. The crux: For these reforms, the FPÖ is making demands that would either completely undo the EU as we know it or that would be impracticable due to their contradictory nature, says Heinisch - for example, when on the one hand the creation of a common European army is demanded while at the same time central EU competences are returned to the national level. This both/and position seems paradoxical, but it is due to socio-political constraints."
" Instead, he will again try to get into Parliament for the Greens. Folkebevægelsen will not choose its next top candidate until the national meeting at the end of October, which means that he or she will have almost six months of experience in Brussels before the Danish media start to deal with EU policy in earnest again.DF: Voters must be disappointed From the other party critical of the EU in Denmark, the Danish People's Party, MEP Morten Messerschmidt wonders. People who have voted for Søren Søndergaard have done so in the expectation of getting him a prominent political post."
" Instead, it could result in fundamental changes to EU cooperation. But if Britain ends up leaving the EU, it is also an open question which way the EU moves. This uncertainty means that the DF cannot decide in advance whether the party will continue to support Denmark's membership or recommend a Danish referendum on withdrawal, explains Søren Espersen. In this situation we must also in our party stand together."
" Interior Minister Herbert Kickl marks his territory. In the second half of 2018, Austria will hold the EU Council Presidency - and when Europe's representatives come to Vienna, they should know what Kickl wants from the EU: tighter asylum procedures and strict EU external border protection. If the FPÖ politician has his way, it should no longer be possible to apply for asylum on European soil. To give weight to these demands, Kickl is looking for allies in Europe."
" Irish support for membership of the EU is strong, but that support does not translate to unconditional approval for the EU's direction of travel and in numerous referendums the Irish electorate have proved that they are not afraid to voice their concerns. Stephen Collins cares less about Sinn Féin's different vision for the EU than he does about promoting the ideological hegemony of the European elites - and their allies in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who share the same view - that says the EU is flawless. - Is mise,"
" Is Salvini's dominance viewed with envy in other countries? Or are the right-wing nationalists deliberately holding back on international family reunions in the European election campaign? The portent of a massive anti-EU movement following a possible electoral success of the AfD in Germany does not loom in any case. This would require a surprise alliance of Le Pen, Orbán, Strache and the AfD in the new European Parliament."
" Is his demand feasible? Brussels The leading candidate of the European People's Party (EPP) for the European elections, Manfred Weber, has sparked a heated debate with his call to cut funding from the European Union (EU) budget for anti-European parties like the AfD.On Tuesday, Weber told the WELT that European parties whose aim is to destroy the European Union, such as the right-wing radicals of Le Pen or large parts of the AfD, should no longer receive money from European funds. The politician from Lower Bavaria gave as his reason: There is no institution in the world that is so naive as to finance its own opponents."
" Is his demand feasible? Brussels The top candidate of the European People's Party (EPP) for the European elections, Manfred Weber, has triggered a heated debate with his demand to cut funds from the European Union (EU) budget for anti-European parties like the AfD - and the AfD is raging.Weber had told WELT on Tuesday: European parties whose aim is to destroy the European Union, such as the right-wing radicals of Le Pen or also large parts of the AfD, should no longer receive money from European pots in future. The politician from Lower Bavaria gave as his reason: There is no institution in the world that is so naive as to finance its own opponents. These anti-European parties use taxpayers' EU money to pay for election campaigns, campaigns and posters whose aim is to abolish the EU. But can Weber's demand be legally implemented at all? The demand violates the principle of equality, says Professor Martin Morlok, a Europe-wide renowned expert on international party law at the University of Düsseldorf."
" Is there criticism of the government's plans? ÖVP and FPÖ praise themselves, the opposition criticises. So far, so predictable. Green MEP Monika Vana, for example, complains that Austria wants to renationalise the Union by advocating a slimmed-down EU budget or cutting family allowances for EU citizens. The red EU mandatary Josef Weidenholzer criticises Austria's attempts at rapprochement with the Visegrád states."
" Isn't that right? That's right, they're both unworkable assumptions. On the second, we must take into account the fact that, since the Treaties do not provide for the exit from the euro, to leave the single currency there is only the exit from the European Union tout court. This is not an objective of either the League or the Five Stars. The contract also hints at the possibility of a referendum on the euro."
" It also marks another turning point in the crisis of the European center-left. Will the Socialists be able to defend their position as the dominant voice of the Spanish left or will they be eclipsed by Unidos Podemos? The answer to that question is also important for the EU and the entire Eurozone. At a time when the threat of Brexit is real, a sharp turn to the left in Spain would set alarm bells ringing in Berlin and Brussels."
" It also selects non-obvious allies. It is no coincidence that the Russian ultra-conservative portal Katehon wrote that on the one hand PiS is obviously a Russophobic and pro-American party, but after all, in a positive dimension, however, PiS's anti-Brussels ideology may one day bring an end to the EU in its current form.The same day as in Russia the quoted text appeared on the far-right website Xportal, close to the Falanga and fans of the synthesis of Bolshevism with ultra-conservatism."
" It also selects non-obvious allies. It is no coincidence that the Russian ultra-conservative portal Katehon wrote that on the one hand PiS is of course a Russophobic and pro-American party, but after all, in a positive dimension, however, the anti-Brussels ideology of PiS may one day bring the end of the EU in its current form.The same day as in Russia the quoted text appeared on the far-right website Xportal, close to the Falanga and fans of the synthesis of Bolshevism with ultra-conservatism."
" It also strikes a PD that seems determined to bet everything on an assignment to Bersani to form the government, with Grillo as a privileged ally: despite the scornful reactions of the comedian. It is a contradictory perspective, for a secretary who had indicated Europeanism as the glue of any alliance: the 5 Star Movement is in fact the most Europhobic in Parliament, along with the League. Despite the fact that the former president of the EU Commission continues to deny it, from the sectors of the Democratic Party that do not see this operation well, a malicious rumor filters through according to which Prodi would mediate in order to bring in dowry to Bersani the votes of the Grills.And yet, few are betting on the success of a maneuver that would imply the willingness of the 5 Star Movement to be part of a coalition with small numbers, and a sense of responsibility to be demonstrated."
" It became a Ritzau story shortly after, which was reproduced in a number of newspapers. Danish People's Party EU rapporteur Kenneth Kristensen Berth was ready with a quotable EU angle: It is problematic that internal market rules are used to determine the extent to which personal watercraft should be available in Denmark, he said. The 8-year-old EU ruling was blamed for a bit of everything as the media carried political commentary on the fatal accident in Copenhagen."
" It can mobilise fears and resentments, but it has no solutions. Good luck to the chancellor who is trying to govern against Europe with an anti-EU and Putin-loving FPÖ.Thus, Austria has been experiencing the following cycle for decades: one tries an SPÖ-ÖVP coalition for a long time, which ends in mutual hatred, then one of the two tries it with the FPÖ, which ends in the ditch."
" It compacted it for just twenty-four hours; but since yesterday it has crumbled again: in Europe and in Italy. In Brussels, confirming the ambiguities of recent months, the Five Star Movement has voted together with the League and the Brothers of Italy against the MES: a regurgitation of the populist front that makes the pro-European conversion of the grillina appear unreliable in recent days. In addition, cross-party dissatisfaction with the agreement reached has surfaced."
" It did not work out in several cities, where we knew in advance that it would be difficult, but we counted on the second round - said the Law and Justice president and argued that his candidates in large cities lost because they were lied to and manipulated by the alleged Polish exit from the European Union. - It is a lie, a lie and once again a lie, Kaczynski argued, saying that Poland would observe EU law and that Porozumienie Centrum, the Law and Justice party's predecessor, was the first party to support Poland's entry into the EEC and later the EU.- But we also expect the European Union authorities to respect this law, he said, explaining that he meant equal treatment."
" It failed to limit the rise of the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which scored 6.6% nationally. A feat predicted by the polls, which should give it 7 seats in the European Parliament. Admittedly, the Eurosceptic party does not have the highs of the National Front in a country where a vast majority of voters are in favour of the European Union and the single currency. But after its 4.7% score in September, the party chaired by economics professor Bernd Lucke is settling into the German political landscape and taking the place of the liberal FDP, which yesterday scored 3%, down 8 points on 2009."
" It gives powerful EU institutions a free hand to further militarise our union. She also claimed the EU Commission was actively colluding to suppress information.Although Sinn Féin is against the UK leaving the union, the party has opposed every EU referendum since Ireland joined the union in 1973.Ms McDonald was the party's MEP for Dublin from 2004 until 2009."
" It goes against my sense of justice, the Prime Minister said. A hard fist against international conventions and the EU's influence in Denmark can be sold as DF victories and soften the frozen climate of cooperation with the support party.And then there are the internal frictions in the Left."
" It hangs like that sword of Damocles and perhaps one day it will strike. I will agree that if it hits PiS and transfers from the EU are stopped at least for a while, there will be a point at which PiS will come out of this dispute on a shield. Because they won't have any answers for that."

" It has been accepted for a very long time, the co-operation that exists between Europe and Nato, and I will see to it that in the conclusions Ireland's neutrality is very well-respected and understood. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy strongly criticised the summit's endorsement of closer ties between the EU and Nato, calling on Mr Kenny to vociferously oppose this further drift towards militarisation in the EU. It is in blatant contradiction of the principle of Irish neutrality and the wishes of the Irish people who wish Ireland pursue a foreign policy based on peace-making and human values, he said."
" It has existed since we started working closely with them as a parliamentary base in 2001. Yes, as a supporting party, the DF accepted that you cooperated in an alternative constellation in EU policy. But can it be reconciled in a cooperative government? I can turn it around and say that when Kristian Thulesen Dahl signals that he wants to go into government himself, despite knowing that there is a significant EU-positive majority in Denmark, it is perhaps also because he is aware that in order to go into government, the ends must be bent towards each other."
" It has remained contained in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Spain. But three major European economies still put this Europhobic current in the lead: the United Kingdom, where Nigel Farage's Brexit party reached 31.7% of the vote, Italy, where the League came first (34.3%) as did the Rassemblement National (RN) in France (23.3%).The question for European national-populists is whether they want to join forces with the European Parliament."

And there is no obvious answer."
 It is a brilliant result. I'm foolishly pleased. The fact that the FPÖ achieved 20.5 percent according to the preliminary results - and doubled its mandates in the EU Parliament - was sensational. But soon it will be all about Strache again: the election campaign is a marathon.
" It is a fact that the majority wants this. Vilimsky also sees no reason for the FPÖ to leave the group of extreme right-wing parties with Marine Le Pen's Front National, which is isolated from the other EU groups. However, it is only valid until the European elections in May 2019."
" It is a false logic, but a large part of the respondents who believed in it - and they want Poland to be able to use EU money (and probably all Poles want this) - chose the veto. Only that such an answer indicates, above all, how much Poles do not want to lose EU money, and not to what extent they support PiS's policy towards the EU.If we wanted to find out what Poles really think about linking the disbursement of EU money to the rule of law and about the announcement of the government of Prague to veto the EU budget, it would be necessary to present respondents with a real alternative."
" It is a natural necessity that when the country we entered the EU with withdraws, we also have to consider where we stand, he says. EUROPEAN POLICY British vote on EU could change the nature of cooperation to such an extent that Denmark should reconsider its membership of the Union, says the Danish People's Party.In a time of growing EU scepticism in several countries and a controversial Dutch 'no' vote in an EU referendum last week, voters in Britain will go to the polls on 23 June to decide whether to say 'yes' to the country's new deal with the EU or to leave cooperation altogether. The result could have major consequences across Europe."
" It is a result that rewards the common battle of the unions of journalists of the main European countries, starting with the FNSI, and the associations of publishers, writers, film authors, actors, directors, film-makers, said in a note, Raffaele Lorusso, secretary general of the National Federation of the press.The European Parliament has approved the report on the rule of law in Hungary that may lead to sanctions against the country. Now the dossier passes to the European Council of EU heads of state and government. The M5s MEPs voted against Orbán, the allies in the Italian government of the League, however, defended the Hungarian president.On the sidelines of his latest speech on the state of the European Union, Commission President Jean Claude Junker said he was appalled by the continuous attacks of viepremier Matteo Salvini on the European Union, while he said he had no problem with cooperation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. It is necessary to build a more united and stronger Europe, Junker stressed, that is a continent of openness and tolerance and does not become instead a fortress in a suffering world."
" It is also a problem for the Rutte administration. Because the Netherlands is in demand in Brussels, precisely because of the PVV's desire to tighten European immigration policy. For this, the Netherlands needs support, but because of the fuss about the PVV's reporting point, the cabinet is threatening to alienate important countries like Poland."
" It is an issue that has at its heart the theme of immigration, on which the League has been able to reap successes and consensus: even if yesterday Salvini and the governor of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Massimiliano Fedriga, had to put the brakes on the strange and dangerous idea for Italy, to create barriers at the border with Slovenia, after the bellicose announcements of recent days. Yet, the reasoning could be extended to other areas: in the first place to the EU.The League, but also the M5S, thought to pickaxe it and then rebuild it in their own image and likeness. Instead, the operation sees them as losers and isolated."
" It is apparently enough for him that Strache does the same. But Kurz ignores the second and third rows of the FPÖ, where there are constantly nazioid individual cases.Kurz's capacity to look the other way will again be severely strained in the EU election campaign. For Kurz himself, the EU is less a grand vision than a construct that needs to be pruned."
" It is by no means a coincidence that after Brexit all the left- and right-wing populists on the continent, who until then wanted to lead their countries out of the European Union, quietly buried this concern. Nowadays, neither Marine Le Pen in France, nor Matteo Salvini in Italy, nor the FPÖ in this country are calling for an exit from the EU. So the Brexit acted as a cautionary tale pour encourager les autres, as Voltaire beautifully and ironically puts it."
" It is called System Failure and aims - according to the blurb of the work - to present the dark sides of the European Union, but also to show how we can solve the problem backlog. Among other things, they criticise the EU's loss of control in the euro and refugee crises. These are the founding themes of the AfD, which was founded in early 2013 by a group of Eurosceptics around Lucke. But few are still interested in the professor's ideas today."
" It is dangerously underestimating the risk to the life of the detainee, even given his age of 74, and the irreparable consequences to the body of deprivation of food and fluids. Borghezio, a member of the European Parliament of the Lega, took an interest in the case. And he questioned the EU. Today is the 27th day of the hunger and thirst strike that the elderly and irreducible Doddore Meloni is sustaining at great risk to his life, the Carroccio exponent wrote last Wednesday in a note published by SardiniaPost."
" It is difficult to get out of this trap built on the thread of propaganda, which treats the spread as a political fabrication. One would think that, just as the M5S-Lega executive has forced the challenge with Brussels to have the economic maneuver rejected, it is now raising its sights to accentuate the clash. However, the harshness of the French and northern European commissioners, and comparisons with Greece, should suggest caution."
" It is from Europe that we need to start again, freeing ourselves from the hegemony of particularisms with no future and of a sovereign narrative ready to propose solutions that are as seductive as they are impracticable, certain in any case to be able to blame the Union for their impracticability. On some times, such as the role of Italy in the European Union, it will be frontal clash with the eventual Lega-M5s government. Andrea Orlando, Minister of Justice and member of the Democratic Party, is convinced of this."
" It is just strange that the EU is now working to undermine the very sovereignty that many of these Eastern countries have gained. I am tired of the old song that the EU is the reason for peace in Europe today, which also the bourgeois except DF and LA have completely bought into.Kasper Støvring believes that K and V have failed in the fight against the EU."
" It is logical. Trump forms an irresistible trio with the artistic couple of Boris and Farage. Podemos also wanted to take us out of the European Union and so they declared in Brussels, although now they deny it. A purpose consistent with the religious nationalism of the Catalan and Basque separatists."
" It is mainly the PVV that mobilizes this rancor and reinforces it with fictitious images of enemies. Thus, our national sovereignty and cultural identity would be incessantly threatened by totalitarian Islam, non-Western immigrants, a conspiring left-wing elite, advancing multiculturalism and the uncontrollable power of the EU.Parodies of election posters of Wilders' PVV on signs in Amsterdam, Haarlem and Amersfoort, 2010.

" It is no coincidence that the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán (described in Paris, where they have no sense of ridicule, as the devil of Budapest), to the Germans who wanted to return immigrants to him, responded with a resounding They'll try, which immediately closes the doors to any loophole or even provocation. But the Dublin Convention, which allows (at this point it is better to say: which would allow) the return of immigrants to the country of entry (in the EU), was certainly not wanted by either Salvini or the League. And the subsequent decision to automatically import into Italy, independent of international rules on rescue at sea) all migrants rescued (or collected) in the Mediterranean is undoubtedly of the Renzi-Alfano government that baptized this delusional initiative from which we must now try to get out, if we can."
" It is not suitable to help the poorest of the poor: At present, the wounded, the elderly, the sick and children often do not make it to the EU. In view of the many refugees pouring into the EU unregistered every day, Kurz said there was a total loss of control within the community. FPÖ leader Strache visited the Spielfeld border crossing yesterday. He pleaded for border fences and considers them to be in order as a matter of course, because at the moment the constitutional state is suspending itself."
" It is now an established reality of French politics and represents a threat to the future of the European Union, since it wants the end of the euro and the renationalization of most of the policies that have been transferred over time to the supranational level. The Front National and other neo-nationalist parties, such as Ukip and the League, make the euro and the European institutions convenient scapegoats, the false culprits of the economic crisis, but the success of their populist propaganda is fed by real errors and defects of European policy, by the obsession with financial rigour at the expense of development strategies and by the lack of democratic legitimacy of the Union's institutions.So it is not surprising that many citizens think that their fate is determined by foreign governments representing the interests of others and by technocratic elites not subject to democratic control."

" It is only by remembering the mistakes of the past that we can avoid making them in the future. For this reason, it is vital that we reject Fianna Fáil's twisted version of reality.' And Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said Mr Martin should be focusing on the Irish Government's response to Brexit and not that of the British government. He said: 'It's one thing to lambast the British government - even though that's justifiable - [but] the main focus has to be on what the Irish Government is doing, or what it's not doing.' He also said that the 'aim has to be to keep the entirety of the island of Ireland in the EU'."

The abolition of the rental contract fee is considered fixed, it was proposed by the FPÖ itself.EU Exit The Free List Austria (around the Salzburg FPÖ rebel Karl Schnell) is surprised that proponents of the referendum for an EU exit recommend voting for the FPÖ."
" It is thanks to the money from Brussels that PiS can finance its generous social program, Poland next to Italy or Spain gets the most money from the post-Covid reconstruction fund. Second, Polish public opinion is three-quarters in favor of the EU. PiS's pursuit of Polexit would create conflict even with a very large part of its own electorate. Well, and there is a third reason that everyone knows - geopolitical."
" It is that of the populists of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) who until yesterday had words of praise for their (alleged) Italian counterparts. Particularly for Salvini's League, which was about to corner the Italian government class in the name of the people, even with the rejection of the European Union or at least of the euro. But now that the League insists on imposing the economist Paolo Savona, who declares the euro to be a German cage, in its proposed government, the AfD has a different interpretation. He speaks of Italian insolence, repeating exactly what all the other German newspapers write, including those of the much detested establishment."
" It is the obvious loss of confidence in my party that moves me to do this, says Mölzer. A little later, his spokesperson added that Mölzer would remain on the Freedom Party's EU list. This was followed by a dispatch from FPÖ Secretary General Kickl, which spoke of Mölzer's withdrawal from his candidacy for the EU elections. Mölzer's spokesperson then announced via the Austria Press Agency that Mölzer was withdrawing completely from the FPÖ list for the EU elections."
" It is the well-known opponents and sceptics of the EU, particularly on the far right, who have attracted most media attention. The Danish People's Party in Denmark, Marine Le Pen's Front National in France and Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party (Ukip) in the UK all pulverised the traditional parties and ran away with around a quarter of the vote in their respective countries.Nationalists also did well in countries like the Netherlands, Austria and Poland."
" It is therefore absolutely right how MEP Othmar Karas reacted to Strache: not with indignation, but with factually based counterattack, with clarification. Thirdly: The Vice-Chancellor is not at all concerned with differentiated criticism of EU policies, he does not propose any practicable solutions that could be worked out with the EU partners. The FPÖ leader always emphasises only the negative in order to appeal to EU sceptics. However, this contradicts the government's proclaimed intention to be pro-European."
" It is understandable that the FPÖ is happy about every signal from Israel, but an extremist like Jehuda Glick is no interlocutor for the ministers of an EU state. Strache is free to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in Vienna, but praising the advocate of illiberal democracy as a great friend of Europe is a clear sign that the FPÖ has not shed its hostility towards the EU. The fact that the blue delegation in the EU Parliament did not immediately leave the alliance with Marine Le Pen can still be justified by institutional inertia. On the other hand, the participation of EU parliamentarian Harald Vilimsky this week in the political Ash Wednesday of the AfD, which is increasingly sliding into extreme right-wing waters, is a provocation directed against Angela Merkel and the ÖVP."
" It is understandable that the bourgeois-liberal parties reject the idea out of hand, although one might wish that they, like many of their party colleagues in Europe, were able to look beyond their ideological nose. For the DF, everything to do with the EU is abhorrent - and at the other end of the scale, the Enhedslisten has formed a bizarrely unholy alliance with the DF on European policy.The government parties are left."

" It keeps the point, the government will confirm the structure of the maneuver, sources in Palazzo Chigi say. A line that is the result of a complicated work of mediation at the summit convened to seal the truce between the League and M5s on the tax decree, but also to examine the double rejection of Moody's and the EU. Only Conte, Salvini and Di Maio showed up at the press conference, but during the closed-door clarification, they say, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria and Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi would have supported the thesis of reducing the deficit-GDP ratio to 2.1, also finding Conte's willingness."
" It leads one to wonder why time was wasted and confusion created, giving the idea of an embarassed Italy. As for the attitude of the League and M5S towards the EU, the assurance of the Vice-Premier and Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, on the respect of spending constraints is positive; ditto that which came yesterday from the other deputy, Luigi Di Maio. Until a few hours before, it seemed that it was only compliance with their miraculous electoral promises that prevailed."
" It makes it very difficult for voters to understand what is really at stake and what they should vote for, she says. Among the many naysayers who have been in Dublin to try to convince the Irish to reject the financial pact was the chairman of the British anti-European party UKIP, Nigel Farrage, who had brought reinforcements in the form of Morten Messerschmidt of the Danish People's Party.Messerschmidt is not a leaker Nigel Farrage had, according to the Irish newspaper The Independent, lured that with Morten Messerschmidt's presence there would be something good for the eyes at his press conference.--But, the newspaper noted dryly, when the journalist took an informal poll among the female audience at the press conference, the consensus was that the Dane was probably better dressed than hot."
" It must be done quickly, because the real risk that the Italian banking system runs is not that of not being solvent, but of delaying the supply of the credit that the economy needs to restart. That's why Brussels must not abuse our patience.What are you doing, riding on the League's anti-Europeanism? No, we don't make polemics regardless, but we make criticisms on the merits."
" It ranges from the fact that it pays for us to the fact that we are more a part of Western Europe than Eastern Europe, we use the Latin alphabet, we are Roman Catholics, culturally we are closer to the West. Lately, it is the pseudo-troubles of the pseudo-Constitutional Tribunal that have infuriated Poles the most - the one a year ago, tightening the already drastic abortion law, and now the one aimed at our presence in the EU. We are furious with PiS because we do not agree to have our rights taken away from us. - This is probably the first thing, and secondly - a large part of the citizens do not agree that power in Poland should be exercised in an unlimited way, completely dependent on the will of one man or one political office."
" It seems to me that on the table for discussion is the Dublin III regulation and that this has gone into the programmatic agreements.... Otherwise, the deputy secretary of the League, Lorenzo Fontana, proposes another approach to the EU: The line on migrants should be decided by a government representative of the people and not by external intrusions... which, in the last six years, have brought more than 600 thousand irregular immigrants to Italy."
" It should be reserved for big issues that affect us and put politicians in a dilemma. I don't think there has been since the last election, says Christina Egelund, referring to the possible legalisation of cannabis and EU issues as obvious things to vote on.In this area, she is in line with the Danish People's Party, which would like to see more EU issues put to the vote. The Schengen agreement was adopted without the people, and that has been a disaster for us."
" It should not be that the authorities are powerless. Dangerous asylum seekers should be allowed to be locked up, even before they commit a crime - this is also justified by an EU directive (see Knowledge). The ÖVP and the FPÖ are now proposing a new form of detention, the so-called preventive detention.For their implementation, the coalitionists would have to amend the constitution."
" It took place in Drumcondra, part of Ms McDonald's Dublin Central constituency. A video posted on the local branch's Facebook shows Mr Browne and Ms McDonald sparring over Sinn Féin's policy on Brexit.He questions why she doesn't advocate Ireland leaving the EU since Sinn Féin has been a long-time critic of the union.Mr Browne puts it to her that it used to be Sinn Féin policy to cut and run, adding this would help ensure there was no hard Border after Brexit."
" It wants to transform traditional völkisch and anti-Semitic nationalism in Germany, which today only appeals to fringe groups, into an internationally acceptable anti-Islamic and EU-critical nationalism. It is therefore not surprising that the AfD invited the Czech nationalist and radical EU critic Václav Klaus as a star guest at its most recent party conference alongside FPÖ grandees. As Czech President, Klaus fought like no other during his country's EU accession negotiations for the preservation of the Benegsh Decrees, on the basis of which more than three million German- and Hungarian-speaking citizens were expropriated and expelled from their homeland."
" It was Europe that allowed Ireland to escape the almost total trade dependence on our nearest neighbour, but also for us to play a real part shaping global policy. There is an irony that, had we followed the advice of the anti-EU politicians on this island - including Sinn Féin - we would have remained shackled to Britain.The economic challenges should not be underestimated."
" It was a major departure for the party to say it was supporting the Remain campaign as, despite presenting a united face, the party was divided on the issue. One of the problems Brexit would cause for Sinn Féin is that the Northern part of this all-Ireland party would be outside the EU, with the Southern part in. Its has predominantly local fears like that Brexit could lead to further division and restore the borders, thereby reinforcing partition."
" It was a very stark reminder that there are many opinions on how Europe should develop, she told Ritzau after the vote. This dividing line goes straight down through the Danish group in the EU parliament. The Danish People's Party's Morten Messerschmidt rejects the new commission because it stands for ever more Europe, which Juncker makes no secret of.He wants stronger coordination of member states' economies, and he has said on several occasions that the EU's immigration policy is outdated."
" It was a weekend that - apart from the carnival - was marked by demonstrations in Villach: three times people took to the streets to express their opinion on the issue of refugees and asylum: The largest action took place on Saturday, when between 500 and 700 people followed the call for a demonstration by the Party of the People to demonstrate on the main square against the Islamisation of Villach and for the people. The federal anthem was played repeatedly, and speakers included former FPÖ National Council member Susanne Winter and EU opponent Robert Marschall, who is seeking a candidacy in the federal presidential election. The demonstration was directed against refugee policies at EU as well as national level and the EU as a whole."
" It was enough that in the Strasbourg Parliament Gardini, an azure MEP, addressed criticism to the Greek leader to trigger Salvini's reaction: Today the most shameful, most insulting, most sordid interventions were those of the EPP, including Forza Italia. If I had to decide today, it is clear that no electoral agreement would be made with them because they cannot think of agreeing in Italy with the League and in Brussels with Merkel. I tell Salvini that we are proudly in the European People's Party, proud of our history and our identity, replied in tone the vice president of the European Parliament Tajani, where the group leader at the Chamber Brunetta is fighting in tune with the League to introduce even in Italy referendums on Europe, now prevented by the Constitution."
" It was not until two and a half months after tents had been erected in Linz that they could be taken down at the end of July. He struck harsher tones in the style of the FPÖ: stricter penalties for smugglers, temporary border controls, admonitions to the EU for its lax refugee policy.2Relative powerlessness of Pühringer against high unemployment rate"
" It will also be on public accounts that we will have to mark a difference between us and the League in the coming months, was the reflection of the vice president of the Council, summarized as follows by one of his closest associates. If Salvini continues to say that he wants to exceed the threshold of 3 percent of the deficit/GDP ratio, we will act as a curb to his raids and we will impose ourselves in order not to increase public spending, becoming the only reliable interlocutors in Brussels. Good intentions on which, on May 26, has overturned the avalanche of votes of the League. And of the fine hopes of the Cricketers, today, little seems to have survived."
" It will be a race against a fall for the ÖVP. According to polls, the ÖVP could slip into third place behind the SPÖ and the FPÖ in the EU elections. In 2009, the ÖVP was still clearly the strongest force with 30 per cent and six mandates, ahead of the SPÖ with 23.7 per cent and five mandates."
" It will be a yardstick for the future course of the ÖVP Chancellor on Europe. Another decisive factor in EU elections is that voter turnout is low; that women (who tend to be more EU-friendly) are more likely to vote than men.FPÖ, SPÖ and the Greens have long since decided that they will run Harald Vilimsky, Andreas Schieder and Werner Kogler as top candidates. In the Neos, the young member of the National Council Claudia Gamon laid claim to it."
" It will be difficult. But the mission of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the G20 underway in Buenos Aires is just that: to convince the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, that the M5S-Lega government is willing to accept certain conditions to avoid an endless conflict with Brussels. It is a problem of tone and mutual respect, not just of numbers: although the idea of a financial maneuver that brings the deficit-GDP ratio to 2.4% appeared provocative."

" It will not be possible to repeat the all against one: Austria as well as France as well as Holland and even Germany will be able to change air next year. . With them the League dreams of giving a blow to the EU, never again servants of a wrong currency like the euro.BY NC ND CERTAIN RESERVED RIGHTS0"
" It would already have the adhesion of parties from a dozen countries and, not having a name yet, for the moment it is called, in fact, only Alliance. The League is a privileged partner of the Front National, says Le Pen, and Salvini to reciprocate - Le Pen's party is by far the strongest in the Alliance - announces that perhaps he will participate, on May 1, in the major demonstration of the French Front, a procession in Paris with deposition of flowers at the statue of Joan of Arc. Good thing there are airplanes."
" It would be damaging for Austria to leave the EU Norbert Hofer. Austria leaving the EU would be a mistake, says the FPÖ presidential candidate. So far, he had only considered such a measure as a last resort in case of undesirable developments."
" It would be disastrous. Democratic Poles should wish Macron success, especially on the issue of EU integration. Admittedly, Poland under PiS will place itself on the far periphery of a renewing Europe, but when these governments in Poland pass away, we too will gain a chance for a better life in a better EU.0"
" It would be just as irresponsible, even fatal, to put the justice portfolio up for disposal. Austria's internal security, Austria's foreign policy and also Austria's justice are those key ministries which, in our opinion, must not be ceded by the election winner to a party that cooperates in the European Parliament with Le Pen, Wilders and parts of the AfD to destroy the EU. We call on the public not to believe the current soft-pedalling of the FPÖ. And we appeal to Federal Party Chairman Sebastian Kurz to refrain from leaving sensitive ministries such as the Interior, Foreign Affairs or Justice to the FPÖ."
" It would be wrong, however, warns the leader of the entrepreneurs, who would mistake the undoubted exploits of the League as an endorsement of the industrialists, including those from the North, for Salvini as premier. It's one thing to have an excellent relationship on the ground with the League's governors, it's another for a government to have Orbán, Le Pen and Putin as allies, or to question the 3% GDP deficit ceiling. Businesses hope that, once the election campaign is over, the language will change and there will be a qualitative leap, says Boccia."
" It's about defending sovereignty and upholding the Basic Law. - Jacek Ozdoba, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Environment and Climate, stated on Twitter. Judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal: provisional measures imposed by the EU Court of Justice on the judiciary are inconsistent with the Polish Constitution. - Law and Justice MP Arkadiusz Mularczyk wrote. The Constitutional Court has drawn a clear line of demarcation between the competences transferred to the EU and those reserved to the sovereign member states."
" It's bad publicity and very unfortunate, says Lars Pedersen. Regardless of party affiliation, this morning we do not meet a single Thyregod citizen who does not think that the case of EU money is either highly criticizable or harmful to the Danish People's Party. The postman, the local pensioners, who meet every Thursday for a game of billiards in Thulesen Dahl's sports club, and not least the baker Birgitte, who stands in Thyregod Bakery, are highly critical of the Danish People's Party and Kristian Thulesen Dahl in the matter. This is a terrible mess."
 It's complicated. First: Vilimsky had expected a discussion on the EU policy of the Freedom Party and the justified accusation that the FPÖ was contributing to the damage and - if possible - destruction of the European Union. He was prepared for that.
" It's not easy. Mr Lockl manages to recall FPÖ motions to leave the EU, which annoys Mr Kickl even more. At least Mr. Kickl then says there will be no election challenge, whereupon families across the country probably threw themselves on the floor in front of the TV set in prayers of thanks."
" It's perfect for him. The leader of the League is likely to have the same role that Le Pen father had in France: electorally significant, around 15%, but functional to the victories of the left. For François Mitterrand, for example, Le Pen was a life insurance policy."
" It's your celebration. Your success, says FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache as he pats his EU top candidate Harald Vilimsky on the back on a small set-up stage on Sunday evening. The crowd at the Adams restaurant in Vienna's eighth district cheers."
" Italy has already the highest cost of the job and we cannot burden still above all the small and averages enterprises. Words that have caused the reaction of Di Maio, who during a Facebook live declared: Enough waiting, the League clarify. It was then the president-designate of the EU commission Ursula von der Leyen to announce that she will fight for the introduction of a minimum wage in every EU country. With gdp increasing by 0.1% in 2019 and 0.7% in 2020, Italy remains last for growth in the EU in both years."
" Italy has not made sufficient progress on debt in 2018, the EU Commission writes in the letter requesting clarification sent to Italy, in which it requests a response by tomorrow. Yesterday took place a first summit sa Chigi palace with the Minister of Economy Giovanni Tria.The undersecretary to the presidency of the council as well as number 2 of the League, Giancarlo Giorgetti wants to open a confrontation with Brussels that is not only to receive indications, but also to coordinate with the EU the priorities of the Italian political agenda. Vice-Premier Matteo Salvini says openly that constraints must be revised."
" Italy is a notable exception. From Germany to the West: the Green cluster?Fifth: the composite front of variously euro-skeptical parties - including all the groups that will be in opposition in Strasbourg: the League and 5 Star, Brexit Party, AfD, Rassemblement National, etc. - was a resounding success in Italy and Great Britain, followed by France, Germany and Poland."
" Italy's Interior Minister and Lega leader, Matteo Salvini, presented a right-wing populist electoral alliance for the European elections in May in Milan on Monday. European Alliance of Peoples and Nations is the name of the alliance that wants to become the strongest political group in the EU Parliament. According to Salvini, around ten movements and parties - including the FPÖ - want to join the electoral alliance: Our goal is to win the EU elections and change the rules of Europe. Other parties will join us.[ Reuters ]S."
" Italy, however, does not agree and Salvini wants first to distribute the approximately 200 migrants arrived in Catania and Pozzallo in recent months with the promise to be all relocated. In the end, most of them remained in our territory and once again Brussels was unable to enforce the agreements. That's why the leader of the League warned Conte that we must not give in without having the guarantees of other states taking responsibility. An even heavier warning will come to Avramopoulos: If Europe continues to talk a lot and take in little, I will avoid identifying those who arrive."
" Italy: coup d'état and financial fascism from Brussels, says FN Paris (AFP) - The FN denounced Monday a coup d'état and financial fascism from the European Union in Italy, where President Sergio Mattarella refused to appoint a populist eurosceptic government, challenging the legitimacy of the Italian head of state, who has the constitutional power to appoint ministers. The European Union and the financial markets are once again confiscating democracy."
" Item. It oscillates back and forth between formal assurances that it stands by the EU, albeit one that will change and reform itself thoroughly, possibly beyond recognition, and implied actions that are clearly anti-European: the grouping in the EU Parliament with radical right-wing, anti-European parties; Norbert Hofer's kiss of the hand for Marine Le Pen; Strache's unthinking, even unthinking claim that the British would be better off after Brexit; the calls for an Öxit referendum; the Briederchen! -The extreme German nationalist background of the 40% of Burschenschafter in the FPÖ club; the longing for Austria to belong to the Visegrád club of EU enemies around Orbán and Kaczy ski. If that's the way it goes, there can be no Kurz government with the FPÖ."
" Its leader has spoken out against anti-Semitism but continues to fly the flag of nationalism, chauvinism and German nationalism. He has just announced that the FPÖ remains hostile to the ideological core of the EU. The former European party ÖVP has a coalition with this party."
" Its sovereignty, which is not nationalism and less so fascism, is certainly positive, as it claims values and powers of individual nations too often trampled on by large European states. But it can not translate into making common group with Eurosceptic movements such as those of Le Pen and Farage. A party like the League, center-right, cannot be allied with populisms.Europe has faults and defects, which must be cured and modified, but Europeanism (which Salvini does not fail to recall (nation, culture, family, religion, even rosaries and crucifixes) constitutes a set of values (Greece, Rome, Jerusalem) that hold up the achievements of our single continent: respect for the other, rule of law, freedom and equality, welfare and meritocracy.. And we need a united Europe to defend ourselves from the economic crisis and the greed of the great empires."
" Izquierda Unida and Unidas Podemos are taking up the baton of the communist parties in Europe, always critical of the euro and the contents of the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. In the Parliament of Navarra, Podemos, EH Bildu and Izquierda-Ezkerra have asked days ago that the flag of the European Union be removed from official places. In Brussels, Podemos and Bildu supported at the time a document on possible mechanisms for leaving the euro."
" Janusz Kowalski, a member of Solidarna Polska - Ziobra's party remaining in coalition with PiS, but even more to the right - went further: Today Poland must take into account the British scenario. The possibility of a post-Brexit in this decade cannot be eliminated if Poland's interests are no longer pursued in the EU. Several MPs from the ultra-conservative and nationalist Law and Justice party have openly questioned the financial benefits of EU membership, in which, incidentally, they cite a green transition that will cost Poland's still coal-based economy dearly. If things continue in this direction, we will have to look for drastic solutions."
" Jesper Larsen sympathises with the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and is critical of East StratCom. His earlier research has been an important source of Marie Krarup's (DF) criticism of the EU office. All information in the article has been verified by Politiken, which has also conducted its own research."
" Julian Schmid, himself wearing a hoodie in parliament, thinks that suits will no longer play a role. FPÖ member Petra Steger wants to see EU competences curbed, the student body wants to see white, old male politics curbed. Foreign Minister and Young ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz referred to the Secretary General of the Young ÖVP, Stefan Schnöll, regarding a Vision 2048.(aich) Stefan Schnöll, Young ÖVP The internet and the interconnectedness of the world have already greatly changed democracy in our country in recent years."
" July addresses. In case of doubt, concerns about the EU loyalty of the small central European country are dispelled even when, for example, Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) recently questioned the EU's fundamental principle of free movement of persons or the sanctions against Russia with a loose tongue. Because suddenly these Austrians then deliver actions again that outwardly strongly express how pro-European they want to be after all."
" Juncker confirmed that. The lightning action had one main purpose: to show the partners that the EU-sceptical FPÖ would not irritate Austria's integration course, which was shaped by the ÖVP and SPÖ - which turned out to be a serious mistake.Mid-December 2019, the small Austrian world in which the big (European) world holds its rehearsal, as the German poet Friedrich Hebbel once wrote, looks very different."
" Juncker rejects FP attack: Demand respect Nafter days of attacks by the FPÖ against the EU Commission President, including calls for his resignation, Jean-Claude Juncker spoke out personally for the first time on Wednesday: ""I am surprised how many medically trained experts there are,"" he said at a press conference in Brussels in response to a question from the Standard. He had been dealing with sciatica for a long time, last Wednesday I had cramps in my legs , he explained why he stumbled while walking during the family photo of the Alliance heads of state and government and was supported by colleagues."
" Just as the smartphone succeeded the Bakelite phone, the governance of Europe needs to be radically reformed and adapted to modern times. The PVV's answer is: get out of the EU and choose isolation. Also parties like VVD and SP taunt the EU , doubly reject any reform, and cling to the failing status quo. Europe's democratic crisis is at least as deep and urgent as its economic and financial crises."
" Justice Minister Josef Moser had to admit that even he did not know the details of the caseHow are the citizens supposed to understand why the government is exerting such pressure for a quick constitutional amendment that restricts civil liberties in order to expand the possibilities of detention pending deportation in asylum procedures? The Aliens Police Act already provides for this measure, as does a fast-track asylum procedure. An the EU, which the FPÖ usually likes to blame for all kinds of evils, cannot be the cause either. The EU Reception Directive of 2013 explicitly mentions these measures in case of danger to national security and public order."
" Kaczynski went further and more cross-country than Orbán. The EU is also afraid of the Hungary-Poland-France triad, i.e. that after Poland the next country where Eurosceptic nationalists will come to power will be France, i.e. Marine Le Pen. And it will go the way of PiS. This is arguably an important additional argument for launching the procedure."
" Kaczynski's allies in this process include Salvini, Le Pen and Orban. If we see how consistently Law and Justice is building its own model of state, which sometimes directly contradicts EU values, we cannot pretend that the threat of postlexit is real. PiS is changing the country in all areas. We have to think that it is not a tactic but a strategy - a broader and long-term plan, at the end of which Poland will break strong ties with the EU. It is a trick to scare Poles with PiS."
" Karas criticises Vilimsky-FPÖ: Wants to destroy Union, wants nationalist Europe ÖVP delegation leader rejects coalition partner's attempts at division in Strasbourg: Chancellor Kurz trusts me, and I trust him Between the delegations of the ÖVP and FPÖ MEPs in the European Parliament, the conflict over the inclusion of the Freedom Party in the group of Europe's extreme right-wing parties is intensifying. Founded under the name Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), it is dominated by Marine Le Pen's French Front National and isolated from all other political groups because of its EU-sceptical course."
" Karas himself, like the European Party ÖVP, deliberately focuses on a positive image of the EU, even if it has to become more democratic. The ÖVP's top candidate and long-time EU mandate holder distances himself from the competition, which is strongly critical of or even opposed to the EU. This applies to the FPÖ as well as to mini-listers who want to profit from Austrians' frustration with the European Union. The question remains whether it is enough for Karas, as a kind of representative of the establishment in Brussels that has been harshly criticised by others, to advertise what the EU has brought to Austria, as he did at the election kick-off in Linz."
" Karas himself, like the European Party ÖVP, deliberately focuses on a positive image of the EU. This alone sets the ÖVP's top candidate and long-time EU mandate holder apart from the competition, which is strongly critical of or even opposed to the EU. This applies to the FPÖ as well as to mini-listers who want to profit from Austrians' frustration with the European Union. The question remains whether it is enough for Karas, as a kind of representative of the establishment in Brussels that has been harshly criticised by others, to advertise what the EU has brought to Austria, as he did at the election kick-off in Linz."
 Karas: FPÖ no longer a partner for EU policy Interview. The ÖVP top candidate sees no future for cooperation with the FPÖ.
" Karoline Edtstadler, State Secretary, who is running second on the ÖVP list in the EU elections, criticised the FPÖ's zigzag course in this context on Tuesday. Among other things, she accused the FPÖ's top candidate, Harald Vilimsky, of representing those forces that did not want to change the EU for the better, and called on the Freedom Party to speak out on Italy's national debt because they were allied with Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's Lega. At the beginning of the week, Salvini had rejected Chancellor Kurz's demand for compliance with EU deficit rules with the words No one should teach Italy lessons."
" Kramer criticises Euroscepticism in the CSU Employers' President: Euro is a guarantee of success Berlin - Employers' President Ingo Kramer has criticised the Eurosceptic tones of the AfD and CSU. ""This kind of thing fuels a latent concern that the EU is hampering our development with its activities,"" Kramer told the newspaper Welt.. ""Some politicians push aside the fact that cooperation in the EU and the existence of the euro are essential factors for our economic success. Kramer also criticised positions that CSU leader"
" Kunasek wants to post soldiers from the Balkans to Africa Kickl has large-scale manoeuvres held in Spielfeld: An influx of refugees like in 2015 is to be stopped S even before Austria takes over the EU Council Presidency, the FPÖ half of the government is also setting its sights on activity: Defence Minister Mario Kunasek spoke out in the Welt am Sonntag in favour of expanding the mandate of the EU border protection agency Frontex and, in addition to police officers, would like to see soldiers posted in the Balkans, but also in Italy as well as Greece, and Europe's border guards should even be deployed in African states, provided consent is given. Specifically, the FPÖ minister wants to present his proposal to his EU counterparts in August."
" Kurz also professes his support for the sanctions. At the same time, however, we need an end to bloc thinking and a reversal of the trend in our relations with Russia"", said the Chancellor before the start of his trip, referring to the EU's foreign policy.The fact that politicians from the ranks of Kurz's government partner, the Freedom Party (FPÖ), have repeatedly called for the sanctions to be lifted is noticed in Moscow, but hardly linked to concrete expectations. The same applies to the cooperation agreement that the FPÖ concluded with the Kremlin party United Russia in 2016."
" Kurz and Juncker had argued that this should also be feasible earlier. In the talks so far, we have seen that the EU Commission's target of fixed figures by 2020 is actually beyond the scope of what is feasible,"" said Herbert Kickl (FPÖ), the current EU Council President and Minister of the Interior, explaining the delay. That is why we are now in the process of exploring compromises. 10,000 civil servants is a good number, but the question is in what time frame it can be established and how it should be composed."
" Kurz is in a dilemma. While FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache is suddenly being soft on the EU, there is no more talk of the absurd northern euro or the end of Schengen. But the FPÖ is still a member of Marine Le Pen's radical anti-EU faction. That's hairy for Kurz."
 Kurz pulls the EU agendas to himself Chancellery. ÖVP and FPÖ rule out a referendum on an Öxit. The Europe section in the Foreign Ministry is thinned out in favour of the Chancellery.
" Kurz refers to the government programme, in which a pro-European course is laid down. But is this more than just a buzzword? Voting in the EU Parliament. A look at the voting behaviour of ÖVP and FPÖ MEPs on concrete EU decisions in the European Parliament shows that the differences are far greater than the Federal Chancellor admits. In the March plenary session of the EU Parliament alone, there was not a single agreement between the ÖVP and the FPÖ in the vote on important EU decisions ranging from regional funding to Brexit to the uniform corporate tax base."
" LAW ENFORCEMENT Other 'no' parties declare their support for a new EU referendum on Europol if the government fails to get a parallel agreement. Here, more than six months later, things are no longer set in granite by the Danish People's Party.After EU President Donald Tusk on Tuesday intensified uncertainty about whether Denmark can get a parallel agreement, the focus has shifted to the No parties' plan B. But in the DF, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth will not guarantee that his party will support the calling of a new referendum that could transfer the limited sovereignty to the EU and thus keep Denmark inside Europol."
" Lars Løkke breaks with recent Danish policy in theEU by saying he will support Cameron's demands. --The Danish People's Party will strongly influence him in formulating Denmark's position on the British demand for more self-determination and reforms of the EU. There are new Danish sounds on the way, and the British and others have noticed."
" Lars Løkke meets DF: I am not interested in free birds. That agreement he stands by regardless of the outcome of the election, just as the DF has agreed with Enhedslisten and Liberal Alliance to try to get a referendum on the EU banking union.Without concessions, the Left can expect more such deals."
 Last night it was still unclear whether that party received enough votes for a seat in the European Parliament. The PVV is seeking kindred spirits from 6 other EU member states to form a Eurosceptic group. That means more money and power.
" Last week, Wilders spoke on Russian state TV Russia Today. The PVV leader spoke of the State of dis-Union, a reference to the European Union, and he was critical of the European approach in the Ukraine crisis. Earlier, Wilders attended a meeting of Eurosceptic parties where Putin supporters stressed that Europe should cherish Christian values and norms."
" Last year, Strache made the chancellor's claim there. The strategy department of the FPÖ, i.e. Secretary General Herbert Kickl, is sticking to this goal. The EU, euro and debt crisis suits him just fine. The tried and tested two-issues policy - foreigners and the EU - is to be retained and even more sharpened and expanded to include the associated family policy."
" Law in the EU is not everything, but without law everything would be nothing - writes commentary author Thomas Schmid. In his opinion, Poland is violating the EU treaty and leaving itself, or more precisely the current Law and Justice government, a convenient wicket. When ever in the future Poland does not like an EU regulation, it will not agree to it, citing the sovereignty of Polish constitutional jurisprudence."
" Le Pen advocates 'Alliance of European nations' The Rassemblement National launched its European campaign on Sunday.. Faced with the wave of eurosceptic parties across the continent, Marine Le Pen wants to believe in the constitution of a - possible if unlikely - majority in the European Parliament to replace the current European Union, which she accuses of """
" Le Pen also uploaded some videos from her time in our capital. The official meeting will take place on Saturday - twelve leaders of European conservative parties will arrive at the invitation of PiS. Among the guests there is Le Pen from French National Union, but also Viktor Orbán, leader of Fidesz, Santiago Abascal from Spanish party Vox. The Estonian Conservative People's Party, the True Finns, the small Romanian Peasant Christian Democratic Party (now so weak that it did not even manage to run on its own in the last two parliamentary elections), the Dutch party JA 21, the nationalist Belgian Flemish Interest responded to the invitation."
" Le Pen did add that she found Putin's actions a little too harsh. Other Eurosceptic parties, such as the PVV, Alternative für Deutschland, Britain's Ukip, and Italy's Five Star Movement, are not so much pro-Putin as they are anti-EU. They stress that the EU has overstepped its bounds with its rapprochement with Ukraine."

" Leading populists like Marine Le Pen in France and Matteo Salvini in Italy, who were stridently hostile to the EU, have now changed their tune and are no longer campaigning to leave. Something similar has happened here with Mary Lou McDonald and Sinn Féin, who campaigned for a No vote in every EU referendum, now describing themselves as Euro critical rather than Euro sceptics.What all of these ultra-nationalists have come to accept is that the EU is popular with its citizens."
" Legally, you cannot be a supranational member of one without joining the other. Today, the EU spokesman of the Danish People's Party, Kenneth Kristensen Berth, finds it hard to imagine that the party could under any circumstances recommend a yes vote in a new referendum on Europol: It's very simple: It is because Schengen will become supranational, we can no longer decide on our own border, he says.-- but before the referendum you said the opposite? Kristian (Thulesen Dahl, ed.) was told in the heat of the battle something that was not party policy and never has been."
" Let us assume that the SPÖ will soon elect a new party leader. Will a Federal President nominate Hofer as Chancellor, or will he say: He doesn't suit me because he is too liberal or too pro-EU and not FPÖ-friendly enough?"
" Let's go back to the D'Alema (Matteo Renzi) bicameral. We will not become slaves of the most infamous system, slaves of Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin (Matteo Salvini, Lega). An Erdogan of ours will not come out (Lorenzo Cesa)."
" Let's treat it as a pre-election lesson for Poles. Jaroslaw Kaczynski asserts that he does not want to take Poland out of the EU. Perhaps he declares it sincerely. But the policy of the Law and Justice president and his team inevitably leads to this.Therefore, the upcoming presidential election will be a plebiscite on whether we are in favor of Poland's place in the European community or whether we are facing a return to Vladimir Putin's harness."
" Let's wait and not comment on announcements, we will talk to a government that will make decisions, i.e. laws and budgets. Away from Brussels, the head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, is also making himself heard, and he seems to appreciate the positions of the League and the Five Star against anti-Russian sanctions: We realize that Italy has been forced to subordinate itself to the collective choices of the EU, and adhere to sanctions against Russia. Because between Moscow and Rome there are good relations, of great trust: for us Rome is a reliable partner and relations have never been interrupted, not even in the most stormy moments from the political and economic point of view."
" Liaison of politics and lies The negation of truth and facts is a trend that is slowly becoming unhealthy Ttwo TV interviews with politicians have recently made waves: the one with Harald Vilimsky, the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU elections, and shortly before that the one with Transport Minister Norbert Hofer (FPÖ) after the truck summit. In both cases, tempers flared over the same question: did politicians publicly tell the untruth here, although they were confronted with proven facts that contradicted their statements? Take Vilimsky, for example: interviewer Armin Wolf asked him if he still wanted the Öxit and to his party friend in the EU Parliament, Marine Le Pen, who wants to break up the EU? Vilimsky saw himself misquoted, brushed aside a clear FPÖ statement on Öxit and said that Le Pen's statements had been mistranslated."
" Like Prime Minister Rutte a day earlier in the House of Representatives, the minister only emphasized that the coalition will stick to the coalition agreement and the parliamentary support agreement. By giving in to Brussels' demands now, he would be giving PVV leader Geert Wilders extra ammunition, even before the negotiations have started. However, he did oppose accounting exercises that cost growth."
" Like the EU Commission, the domestic Social Democrats want an obligation for large corporations to report their profits and income taxes paid individually for each country in which they operate. The ÖVP and FPÖ voted against it in the EU Parliament.The rigorous demand for a general ban on letter-box companies is certainly not in line."
" Like your wife coming back from an afternoon of shopping saying she got a great discount, while refusing to say what she spent. The House of Representatives has repeatedly asked in vain what exactly the Netherlands has lost to Brussels. This is now the third time we have to ask it, says PVV MP Madlener. While parliaments in other countries do get to see exactly what they are spending on the EU and what they are receiving."
" Lite with Rome STRASBOURG New harsh clash between the European Commission and the M5S-Lega government. This time the attack came from the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, French socialist Pierre Moscovici, who challenged from the struggling public accounts to the anti-European line and the treatment of migrants. The retort of European Affairs Minister Paolo Savona, who is considered a Eurosceptic in Brussels, was reinforced by that of Leghist Vice-Premier Matteo Salvini."

" Lombardy is the first agricultural region in Italy but is far behind in the use of funds - explain the councilors of the PD Enrico Brambilla and Agostino Alloni -, that we risk losing, when instead they should be used for our agricultural enterprises. For Brambilla, the problem should also be seen against the backdrop of relations between Lombardy and the EU, which are also characterized by the Euroscepticism of the Northern League. The Budget Committee of the Pirellone, on a proposal by Alessandro Colucci and Angelo Capelli (Popular Lombardy), has also included yesterday a postilla to the European resolution, which will be voted on Tuesday, which urges the Executive to commit the European resources available to the agri-food sector to avoid the triggering of the financial disengagement of Brussels."

" Love thy neighbour Asylum cheats have to go Red-Black doesn't want to understand that We help our own country first Red-Black helps bank and speculator We cut EU contributions Always chic and sleek: Purely visually, the FPÖ leader outranks his opponents. What also goes down well with younger people is that he regularly hangs out on Facebook, sometimes even in his swimming trunks."
" Luciferino is also the fact that the scientific committee that has traced the Tagliadebito of this and other media is chaired by none other than former minister Giulio Tremonti, who not only carried out the stripping of the real estate assets of the central state, transferring about 400 billion euros of buildings to municipalities, provinces and regions, in many cases not transferring wealth but losses due to the inefficient management of the properties themselves, but claimed at the time that the Tagliadebito project was neither current nor feasible. No one can question the intelligence of Tremonti, also documented by a lucid letter sent to Corriere della Sera on Thursday 9 on the problems of infringement actions by the EU, but being at the time supported by the League, he did not want to go against those who had as their reason for being the federalism and then the devolution of property. Similarly, having in this case the objective of succeeding Silvio Berlusconi with the support of the EU, he argued that the Italian banking system was the healthiest in Europe because the national credit institutions did not have in their bellies the bomb of the derivatives of other European banks gone into crisis."
" MEP Andreas Mölzer: ""In the next five years, the FPÖ will continue to be the only party for which the interests of our homeland have priority and not the guidelines of the Brussels headquarters. EU-friendliness, however, is a condition of the ÖVP's coalition. And in its first public appearance after the election, the FPÖ showed little interest in the ÖVP's offer of talks. From the point of view of FP leader Heinz-Christian Strache, this is merely an attempt to drive up the price of a coalition with the SPÖ."

" Macron also looks to the left and aims to involve Tsipras, who has long abandoned radicalism and is in great harmony with the head of the Elysée.The sovereign galaxyOn the opposite side of the field are those movements that make the defense of borders (European, but especially national) and criticism of the Brussels establishment their war horses. The Austrians of the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National, Wilders' Dutch Freedom Party or the Germans of the Afd, as well as the League itself, of course. Many of these today are gathered in Strasbourg in the Europe of Nations and Freedoms group and in the next legislature are ready to join the Conservatives - the Poles in primis - orphaned by the British."
" Macron continues. In the wake of the French right's slide towards the FN, a pro-Macron MP who was expelled from the LR party, Thierry Solère, told BFM that a pro-European right-wing political offer needs to be created.

" Mandates in the Federal Council and the National Council follow. Since 2006, the passionate motorcyclist, who has crossed the Sahara several times, has been General Secretary of the Strache FPÖ.

" Many years of embracing immigration, free trade, globalisation and the EU have now been replaced by horror stories, annoying discussions about Danishness and a fundamental scepticism about most things south of Kruså. From the Social Democratic side, this is best expressed in the marriage-like relationship with the Danish People's Party, the halt to quota refugees and the recently announced EU cuts. Attitudes that not only contradict those Erhard Jakobsen stood for and campaigned for during his time in the Social Democratic Party, but also reflect a new direction for the party, where emotions come before reason."
" Many, however, never expect too much from Brussels' decisions. Another crumbling consensus.Euroskepticism (or rather the reformulation of the EU) will be a new vote granary for Vox in the event of an early election. This will be added to the questioning of gender policies that at the time were approved by PP and PSOE."
" March 2016 recommended. After politicians from the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) spoke out vehemently against a possible cash ban in the EU at the beginning of 2016, the magazine described such fears as a campaign full of exaggerations, mixed-up facts and anti-European resentment. The result of an enquiry to the EU Commission served as central evidence for the magazins."
" Marcin Ociepa, a politician from this party, said in an interview for TOK FM that his party would vote for the bill if it complied with EU regulations.

This presence would be symbolic for the two party leaders, who are also members of the National Assembly and who have no chance of being elected to the European Parliament."

" Marine Le Pen wants to believe in the victory of European nations in 2019 Nice (AFP) - Marine Le Pen said Tuesday that the victory of national-populist parties in the European elections was possible, with several representatives gathered around the FN in Nice, where they defended the identity of nations and the Hellenic-Christian origins of European civilization. The prospect of getting a majority to change Europe is not so unlikely."
" Marine Le Pen's party voted against the European Defence Fund, against strengthening external border controls, against the fight against social dumping and against the fight against terrorism. The result of five years of massive presence of the RN in the European Parliament is a decline in French influence in Europe. You propose a more protective Europe, closer to the citizens."

" Marion Maréchal-Le Pen wants to talk about people, roots, soul. For her part, Marine Le Pen is still trying to show that the FN's European project has nothing to do with the exit from the euro that she advocated during the presidential election. The disaster of the debate between the two rounds against Macron made the far-right party understand that it had to forget about a Frexit that did not say its name in order to promote a Europe of Nations and change the EU from within."
" Martin says Sinn Féin and 'Ming' are anti-EU FF leader claims MEPs will waste time pursuing false conspiracies about EU Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has made a scathing attack on Sinn Féin and a number of prominent Independent candidates in the EU parliament elections accusing them of being inherently anti-European. Speaking at the launch of his party's manifesto for the elections yesterday, Mr Martin said there was a real possibility that Ireland could send to the parliament MEPs who [have] a fundamentally anti-EU position and . . . will spend endless hours pursuing false conspiracies about EU militarisation."
" Mateusz Morawiecki's government started talking to EU institutions in a different language after the failure of the &bdquo;white paper in Brussels. The document prepared by the Law and Justice (PiS) government was supposed to explain to Europe why &bdquo;reform of the judiciary is necessary and compatible with European law, but the &bdquo;white paper even infuriated several EU countries.The PiS was then left with only the word &bdquo;concessions to enter the European repertoire. That in itself is a big change - Beata Szydlo's government, instead of talking to the European Commission, was throwing mud at its officials and calling it &bdquo;dialogue."
" Matteo Salvini thus commented on the outcome of the bilateral talks with his German counterpart. In Innsbruck for the EU Council of Interior Ministers, the League leader speaks of an understanding with Germany, despite the fact that the issue of rejections puts Rome and Berlin on a collision course. Yet Salvini is convinced that the battle for a more robust defense of the Union's external borders offers enough common ground for Italy and Germany to work together to be able to resolve current disagreements."
" Matter of civilization. Not surprisingly, the nine-member staff of the PVV delegation in the Europarliament were surprised by the announcement that they had lost their jobs with immediate effect, as the AD reported this morning. . Hypocrisy, or a logical outgrowth of the PVV idea that the Netherlands and the EU should have nothing to do with each other?0"
" Matthijs found that the anti-Europe stance fostered by British Prime Minister Cameron is rooted in ill-informed conservatism and an outdated idea of sovereignty. These accusations also apply to the Burgerforum-EU, the PVV and the SP who last Tuesday passionately argued for a referendum on the alleged creeping transfer of power to Brussels. This must stop and if powers are transferred anyway, then the people must have their say."
" Maybe responsible anyway, but maybe not. And one can also somehow understand that for electoral reasons the FPÖ is now clawing a topic that goes beyond its standard repertoire (criticism of foreigners and the EU), i.e. that the FPÖ is taking up the Corona measures concerns. But the act that the FPÖ is now deliberately pulling off provocatively, regardless of losses - with rising infection figures in this country and lockdown-like measures elsewhere - is decidedly too irresponsible: election campaigning, demonstratively without distance, but with cheerful handshaking."
 McCarthy repeats Yes call after SF's 'twisted quotes' A LEADING economist last night repeated his call for the EU fiscal treaty referendum to be passed -- despite Sinn Fein's attempts to use him to back their anti-treaty campaign.

" Meanwhile, Polish courts are in the European average when it comes to the lengthiness of proceedings. PiS will introduce any law if it wants to. And if the European Union or the Council of Europe criticise the government for it, PiS will say that we have risen from our knees and we will not have to explain ourselves to anyone.Pacification of the courts by PiS could only be stopped by the judges themselves."
" Meanwhile, in the forums of social media, politicians are not holding back either, with comments that are sometimes more than insulting. For example, a Linz FPÖ functionary called the newly elected US president Joe Biden a paedophile scumbag and a disgusting guy on a closed Facebook page frequented by around 500 users. For him, the EU is shit and the Greens are scum. In response to a question from the STANDARD, Markus Hein, vice-mayor of the FPÖ in Linz, said that the man was probably neither a fan of our government, the Greens nor of Joe Biden. However, I do not comment on the content of private opinions."
" Members will be able to vote on issues that divide the Front, such as EU membership or leaving the euro. These questions divide the party, especially since the departure of Florian Philippot, and the answers of the members could justify a change of line, a possible right-wingisation or an erasing of the anti-euro and anti-EU diatribes.Other traditional FN themes, such as immigration, are addressed: should it remain one of the main themes of the programme? Should it be drastically limited?The maintenance of the 35-hour working week or retirement at 60, the abolition of the wealth tax, the return of military service, homosexual marriage, access to MAP and GPA, the prohibition of euthanasia, the reinstatement of the death penalty or the institution of an incompressible real-life prison sentence are also among the many issues addressed."
" Meuthen, who is not a member of the parliamentary group, promptly replied: ""In principle, in my personal opinion, I do not think it is a good practice to run in a double pack. Continued: Did the AfD's demand for Germany to leave the EU hurt it? Chrupalla did not think so, but Meuthen did. Meuthen also seemed uncomfortable with the AfD's strength in parts of eastern Germany, where Chrupalla brilliantly defended the direct mandate in Görlitz."
" Michael Aastrup Jensen wonders about the campaign against Macron. Macron has made it a trademark that he also wants the EU to become narrower in some areas, which I also think that even the DF supports. I don't understand why they are trying to build him up into some big villain, says the V rapporteur."
" More than a few CSU politicians and their supporters expressed gloating satisfaction after Merkel failed to commit all member states to a European solution at the Brussels summit. That EU solutions are supposedly useless anyway - that is the consensus in the AfD.In all this, it remains unclear whether the manifold strengthening of the AfD was only due to clumsiness on the part of the CSU strategists."
" Moreover, if the PvdA goes down much harder than the VVD, it will affect the balance of power in the cabinet. But de Voogd also knows: The PvdA quite often does better than predicted in municipal elections. PVV Geert Wilders has also already started the election campaign, but with the anti-EU fight for the European elections on May 22. In fact, he only participates locally in The Hague and Almere."
" Moreover, the contract of the yellow-green government calls for the cancellation of sanctions against Russia, but confirms that Italy is part of NATO and that the U.S. is a privileged ally. Salvini - who among other things has said that European populists have invited him to run for the leadership of the EU Commission - however, he also has another ally: Vladimir Putin. It is no secret. The League and the Putinist United Russia party even have a collaboration agreement. Salvini was unable to meet with the Russian president, in Sochi for a bilateral."
" Moreover, the election of management consultant Alice Weidel as the second top candidate for the Bundestag elections alongside Alexander Gauland is supposed to demonstrate economic competence. But for many German businesses, the AfD's demands to scrap the euro and drastically restrict immigration are a vision of horror. EU citizens should only receive social benefits in this country if they have previously spent at least four. This would severely restrict the free movement of workers within Europe."
" Moscovici explained that his institution does not intend to be accused of not having waited for the new Italian government to become operational. The infringement procedure, caused by excessive debt, would not have been triggered by the shift to 2018 of spending on increases to the state in 2017. But a Eurobarometer survey, which attributes a positive opinion of the EU to only 39% of Italians, and the risk of increasing support for M5S and Lega in the event of penalizing actions against the new executive would also have had an influence.For the EU Commission Italy remains with excessive macroeconomic imbalances (with Croatia and Cyprus)."
" Most likely, however, the former is the case. In view of the slogan Austria first instead of EU madness, there is little to suggest that the FPÖ would really have become more restrained. Nevertheless, we are astonished to note that the FPÖ is campaigning and the issue of foreigners does not even come up."
 Mr Durkan made the pointed reference to Sinn Féin's support for the Provisional IRA's campaign of terror as he responded to criticisms made by his Dublin opponent Lynn Boylan during the campaign. Ms Boylan has claimed that Fine Gael can't be trusted with Irish neutrality and wants further integration and militarisation in the EU. Mr Durkan said Sinn Féin's claims come from a playbook of innuendo against Europe.He said he was someone who negotiated for peace in Northern Ireland and voted against military action in Syria and Libya when he was a Westminster MP.
" Ms Le Pen had loudly rejoiced in the Brexit victory in June 2016. Yet the Brexit, long before the calamitous debate with Emmanuel Macron, marked the beginning of her woes. It has proved more damaging to the British, now embarrassed, than to the rest of Europeans. It forced the FN president to put off her Frexit, and pushed her into a confused pas de deux on the euro. History may be repeating itself with protectionism."
" Ms O'Neill believes Brexit poses an unprecedented threat to the North's economy and is urging business people to make their voices heard on ensuring Northern Ireland has continued unfettered access to the EU and its associated benefits. There is no such thing as a soft Border, she emphatically told local business leaders during the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce 5 Leaders, 5 Days event in Magherafelt yesterday .It is vital we maintain the full exposure to the European Union - we have to fight for it. Sinn Féin has set out our proposals for achieving designated special status for the North to remain within the EU. 'Whole island'"
" Much of the electorate is sensitive to their skepticism. A large majority still support membership in the European Union, but doubts are firm. Almost a quarter of the voters are in favour of leaving. This view is particularly strong among PVV voters (55 percent) and SP voters (31 percent). Doubts about the usefulness of the European Union are especially evident in the responses to the statement that the Netherlands has benefited from membership."
 Muted déjà vu The FPÖ had 17.4 per cent in the 2008 National Council election. Now it had 17.2 per cent in the 2019 EU election. In between was the rise of the FPÖ.
 My position has been very clear for years and will not change in this election campaign. The FPÖ put a promotional video for the EU election online yesterday. It is in the ironic style of the 2017 National Council election videos.
" My view is that we should not risk a situation where Denmark is put even further on a slippery slope, where we lose influence, she says. The Conservatives' EU spokesperson, Lene Espersen, also wants the prime minister to find a date sooner: Together with the Left, we have pushed hard for a hearing, because so much is happening at EU level.DF sees more bourgeois EU scepticism EU cooperation is under historic pressure, not least because of the economic crisis, and on Friday last week negotiations on a long-term budget collapsed.Kristian Thulesen Dahl points out that the crisis has changed attitudes towards the EU in a number of countries."
" Mölzer and Vilimsky: Good Cop, Bad Cop for the Freedom Party The FPÖ does not want to leave the EU and fancies its chances of coming first.The FPÖ's top candidate duo has divided up the work roughly like this: Harald Vilimsky will formulate the criticism of the EU - and, as the saying goes, in a very strong way."
" Mölzer stressed that nothing would stand in the way of a joint parliamentary group with the friendly parties after the election. So far, these parties - and thus also Mölzerc - are without a parliamentary group in the EU Parliament. The FPÖ is considering the Belgian Vlaams Belang, the party of Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and the Front National in France as future allies. Strache is not afraid that the cooperation of the various right-wing parties will not work out: they have the same opinion on many issues, for example, when it comes to Turkey's accession to the EU."
" NATO, the USA and the EU are also repeatedly criticised. In 2009, Strache spoke out in favour of Russia joining the EU. In the Ukraine conflict, the FPÖ took a clear position in favour of Russia and also undertook several sharply criticised trips.The FPÖ has also been a strong supporter of Russia in economic matters for years - individual FPÖ MPs have and have had trade relations with Russia with their companies."
" NEWS 39 per cent of FPÖ voters in favour of Öxit FPÖ sympathisers are most likely to prefer Austria to leave the EU, but they do not form the majority in this voter group either. This is the result of a new survey by the Social Science Study Society."
" NEWS FPÖ against stricter EU gun laws The FPÖ has criticised a total failure of the European Union in tightening gun laws and demanded liberalisation in Austria in return. Harald Vilimsky, the leader of the Freedom Party delegation in the EU Parliament, demanded that judges, public prosecutors, doctors and money messengers be allowed to carry weapons and that the current limit on the number of weapons be lifted."
" Namely, analogous to the basic programme, if the EU is not strongly changed and transformed into a mere union of sovereign nation states. The draft programme states that for such a change in the EU, the AfD believes that the Lisbon, Schengen and Maastricht Treaties would have to be repealed.True to its previous programme, the AfD has also largely perpetuated the existing ambiguities in tax and social policy."
 National Council rejected referendum on EU exit FPÖ demanded a non-binding referendum on EU membership without success.Vienna.
" National Front: the most Europhile of the Europhobic parties Is there anything more European than the National Front? Forty years of trumpeting successes and pitiful setbacks have placed this paradox at the heart of the history of the movement, which hopes to beat the presidential list led by Nathalie Loiseau on 26 May. While the far-right party (which changed its name to Rassemblement national in June 2018) has made national sovereignty an absolute, it has never lost sight of the interest of a ballot that has installed it, since 1984, among the main political forces, and allowed many of its executives to make a living from politics as elected representatives or parliamentary assistants."
" Nationalist, anti-European, anti-immigrant, and pro-law and order but without a head rag tax and fewer Moroccans. And with members and an internal party democracy. Many people support the PVV's positions on the EU, immigration and Islam , Roos said Tuesday in an interview with De Telegraaf. But they do not agree with the way in which the PVV wants to do something about it."
 Negotiations are ongoing and so far do not bode ill. But even last night the League ministers were clear. The government program must be implemented. No matter what Brussels says.© RESERVED REPRODUCTION
" Neither Kaczynski nor Ziobra will be in politics anymore when our children and grandchildren will suffer the consequences of these people's madness. The vetoing of the EU budget is solely in the interest of PiS, a result of the fight within the right-wing camp. Ziobro and a weakening Kaczynski want to get rid of the constraints on increasing their despotic power in an isolated country."
" Never before have so many voters needed an explanation before and after the (run-off) election: as a bourgeois, as a freelancer, as an industrialist, as an academic, as a conservative, as a liberal, as an ÖVP, Neos, Griss voter, one would never have voted for the left-wing, the green Van der Bellen, if another electable candidate had been available as an alternative. But the FPÖ-Hofer, someone from this compromised corner, who also presents himself as a proud party candidate, as an EU opponent, that is really not acceptable, at least for the wafer-thin, if so far sufficient, majority in the country.Once again, what the writer Hans Weigl once wrote about the voting behaviour of Austrians has proven to be true: Austrians do not vote for something, but mostly against it."
" Never mind that Micheal Martin has ruled out leading his party into coalition with Sinn Fein at the next election. Forget about the many criticisms Fianna Fail has heaped on Sinn Fein about its support for the IRA, its economic policies and its opposition to every EU treaty.The first rule of politics is being able to count, and FF's Thomas Byrne knows that if he is to beat Fine Gael's Helen McEntee in Meath East, he needs transfers."
" Nevertheless, almost two out of three respondents believe that membership in this organization protects them a great deal (18.2%) or a fair amount (45.9%) from global shocks. Again, the most convinced are the voters of the PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE and the most critical, those who vote for Esquerra, UNO Podemos and Puigdemont.The data of this survey corroborate that the feeling in favor of the EU is quite transversal and that it constitutes one of the few consensuses that exist in Spanish politics. Attachment to the EU has suffered less than that of other EU neighbors with the passing of the crisis."

" Nevertheless, the AfD wants to form a joint parliamentary group with the Lega in the European Parliament. There are differences between Lega and AfD. But political groups in the EU Parliament are different from those in the Bundestag because the range of content is necessarily much wider. We are united by our insistence on national sovereignty and our desire to stop Islamisation and migration."
" Nevertheless, the image of the EU is not exclusively positive: 61 percent (minus one point) think that Brussels has too much influence on the states. Since the Brexit result became known, the general image of the EU among Germans has improved.The Chancellor winsChancellorThe AfD loses#NAME?"
" New elections had been called for September.'Europe' was a major theme in that campaign - often reduced in debates to the question Should we put more billions into Greece and other weak European member states, yes or no? As list leader of the VVD, he had to take sides with the anti-European stance of the PVV, the former parliamentary support partner. At an EU summit of government leaders in late June 2012, the initial impetus was given to the banking union, a super reform that would make banking supervision more European. Afterwards, Rutte was blamed by the House of Representatives for taking a big turn."
" News Challenge to the Fiscal Compact at the Constitutional Court fails FPÖ, BZÖ and Greens have failed with a joint motion against the EU Fiscal Compact at the Constitutional Court (VfGH). The point of contention was the question of whether the red-black coalition was allowed to pass the state treaty in July 2012 with a simple majority or whether a two-thirds majority would have been necessary."
" News FPÖ fears attack by an EU army In a parliamentary question to Defence Minister Gerald Klug, FPÖ National Council member Susanne Winter inquired about preparations for the establishment of an EU army. She addressed nine questions to Klug."
" News This is how MEPs voted on the Commission Of the Austrian MEPs, all SPÖ, ÖVP and Neos MEP Angelika Mlinar voted in favour of the new EU Commission this week. The FPÖ MEPs and also all the Green MEPs voted against the new Commission team, which will be appointed on 1 January. November takes up its work."
" News Vilimsky wants to go into the eye of the hurricane EU elections. Harald Vilimsky, the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU Parliamentary elections, announces a tough approach for his work in a press interview. In order to reform the undemocratic EU according to his ideas, he would have to go into the eye of the hurricane."
" Next cash payment in Strache's environment: mandate purchase? FPÖ allegedly demanded 100,000 euros from former MP Kappel to get on EU list B-Reports of bundles of banknotes in Heinz-Christian Strache's sports bag and rucksack last week gave the impression that the FPÖ leadership has a very intimate relationship with cash. Now another case is coming to light that raises many questions."
" No declaration adopted by the EU summit will change the fact that the Community will be able to punish violations of the rule of law. EU leaders can wrap this up with assurances of all kinds, but the provisions adopted by the EU in July on a mechanism making the disbursement of funds conditional on compliance with the rule of law and other fundamental EU principles remain unchanged. Poland PiS, by threatening a veto, is in the same place as in 2007. during the negotiations of the new European Treaty."
" No misunderstanding: the rise of the euro-critics is undeniable, and Great News. But the scoreboard will soon show that the parties that warmly support the EU in decreasing temperatures (D66, GroenLinks, PvdA, CDA and VVD) manage to attract significantly more voters to the polling stations than the parties that say: away with this EU (in decreasing coldness these are Article 50, PVV, SP, CU/SGP). EU-wide, the difference between pro and con is even more obvious."
 No money for EU opponents - AfD reacts indignantly Manfred Weber wants anti-European parties to no longer be funded from the EU budget. Is his demand feasible? Brussels
" No party, he explains, has obtained enough seats to govern alone, so to assess the impact of the vote on relations between Russia and Italy, we need to see what executive will be formed and what kind of policies it will adopt. According to Makarkin, what happened in Greece could happen again: After the victory of Tsipras, it was assumed a radical approach of Athens to Russia, but this - remarks the expert - did not happen. Russia is accused of having tried to interfere in the Italian vote - and in that of many other Western countries - spreading on the web anti-EU and anti-immigrant messages. The reciprocal sympathies between Moscow on one side and Lega and M5S on the other are under everyone's eyes. And Salvini's party even has a political cooperation agreement with Putin's party, United Russia."
" No resistance is noticeable from them across Europe. Meanwhile, he demands a clarification from his party, the ÖVP, regarding government cooperation with the FPÖ. The EU policy gives the two governing parties the opportunity to work out their different positions anyway: After Chancellor and ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz called for a revision of the EU treaties and an abandonment of the unanimity principle, he earned sharp criticism from Vilimsky, who sees the interests of the nation states in danger. He was countered by VP runner-up Karoline Edtstadler: ""We must strictly prevent the current development towards social union."
" No stronger force has ruled the whole spiritual and political life. That is why there are no other parties than the Danish Democratic Party who want a revolt against internationalism, conventions and the EU, and why only the Progress Party voted against the Aliens Act in 1983.For more than a century, the entire political compass has been guided by the Literary Left, which the Brandensians founded."
" No to flexibility, forward with rigor. Renzi has to reckon with the anti-Europeans and / or anti-Euro such as Lega Nord, Cinquestelle, the French Front National of Marine Le Pen, the Anglo-Saxon group of Nigel Farage . And perhaps he will also have to reckon with some of the socialists who at the moment seem to be united in supporting him, but, as the old policy teaches, even in Europe it seems not to die, you never know. For the Prime Minister there will soon be another challenge at the next European Council on July 16 in which the main appointments of the Commission will have to be decided with the division of responsibilities, the most important of which, and which concerns us most closely, is that of Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired so far by the Finnish hawk Olii Rehn. Undoubtedly the lively confrontation between Weber and Renzi did not go unnoticed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has always shown appreciation for the young Italian Prime Minister so far."
" No wonder it is difficult for them to understand Europe's objections to changes in the Polish justice system, since they operate with completely different sets of notions and hierarchies of values. The second conclusion is more concrete and was formulated both by Witold Waszczykowski, when he was still the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and - even more clearly - by the Law and Justice ambassador in Berlin, Andrzej Przylebski, in his repeated statements for various German media: the Law and Justice government does not want a post-lexit, but it also does not want to be in the EU as it is now. It wants a deep reform of the EU, and its direction would clearly go against the current trends. Waszczykowski suggested a return to a free trade area or customs union."
" No wonder people are unhappy. Many of the people René Rasmussen knows vote for the Danish People's Party and are against more EU integration.--Not only because of the strangers, but also because they feel economically powerless."
" No wonder, then, that the first agreements could be presented here. As long as the EU's external border is not secured, the ÖVP and FPÖ want to control the borders nationally. Recognised refugees should no longer be able to apply for citizenship after six years, but - like immigrants - only after ten years."
" No, Sala's Migrants Reversed. With the Milanese deputies of the PD presenting a question to the Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, denouncing the return of camps of hundreds of migrants in Porta Venezia and Central due to the rejections of EU countries friends of Salvini, and the center-right with the League in the lead that sends the ball back into the opponent's camp accusing the mayor Sala and Majorino of having created the political conditions for the return of migrants. Put in brutal terms, It's Salvini's fault."
" None of the leaders believe Conte's trip will bring anything. Indeed, both Di Maio and Salvini give an electoral declination of the clash with Brussels. The Minister of the Interior keeps repeating to ministers and League leaders that the procedure will be an excellent argument for our European election campaign. And the cricketer reiterates, In May, this Commission will no longer be there."
 Norbert Hofer says no to Öxit European Union. The FPÖ presidential candidate does not want to run an anti-EU campaign. This may also be related to the fact that the Austrians - especially since the Brexit vote - do not want to leave the EU.
" Not everyone wanted to sail under the official flag, i.e. the flag of the Greens, said Michael Kerbler, spokesperson for the initiative and former ORF journalist. The prominent supporters were mainly harshly critical of the opposing candidate, Norbert Hofer (FPÖ), and his EU course. Some people believe that it is an act of personal hygiene if they change their opinion on an issue as often as they change their shirt, Lacina said, alluding to Hofer's statements on a possible Öxit."
" Not least because it records a rare case where the main government and opposition parties are all resolutely against the introduction of the single timetable. In Strasbourg, MEPs from M5S, Lega, Pd and Forza Italia almost all voted no to the EU Commission's proposal. That of the change of the hands is a tradition that brings several benefits: longer days, energy savings, more outdoor activities - said the MEP of the PD Nicola Danti to explain the opposition of his party -."
" Not least due to pressure from the industrialists of this country. And FPÖ regional party leader Manfred Haimbuchner is also emphatically pro-business and pro-EU, wants more CSU for the party and less Le Pen.The ÖVP, with its economic wing and workers' wing, is much more involved in the social partnership."
" Not only Rutte, all Dutch leaders have failed to do so since the referendum on the European Constitution. In this, fear of electoral loss due to the Nexit course of Wilders (PVV) and Baudet (FVD) plays a role. The success of the EU depends on the will of national government leaders. Merkel and Macron see this."
" Not only that, after becoming the first Italian party by votes achieved, the League, invested by a political, media and judicial fire, concentrated, reminiscent of the worst times of Berlusconi in government, while not losing many consensus, has begun a downward phase that, to prevent his party from entering the screw, and thus become irrecoverable, requires appropriate measures.The League, by decision and merit of Salvini, from being a resolutely secessionist party, so wanted by Bossi, who had as enemies the South of the country and Roma ladrona, has almost suddenly turned into a national party, which wants to represent the whole country. Since all parties (even if they all don't admit it, but that's how things are) in order to stand, need a bau-bau, the latter, no longer being the South, had become, for the League, the European Union.Only Salvini, while knowing that by attacking the South you lose the votes (in fact, the League of Bossi, before the great leap of Salvini took 7% of the vote) has not taken into account that, by attacking the EU head-on, would be crushed by the latter, as it had already shown to be able to do with Silvio Berlusconi whose government in fact, at the time of Napolitano, was not sent home by the vote of the Italians, but directly from a financial and political crisis fueled specifically by Brussels. Although he has been an MEP for several terms, Salvini has heavily underestimated Europe."
" Not that Orbán's presence was ever expected on the stage in Milan, but in perspective the possibilities of a great European sovereignist alliance are reduced. This is no small matter: the League has always maintained that many of the difficulties with the EU (first and foremost, the next financial law) will be resolved thanks to the new European framework. Anyway, on the stage in Piazza Duomo with Salvini, besides the historical friends Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders (Netherlands), there will be the representatives of the populist and Eurosceptic parties of Bulgaria (Volya), Slovakia (Sme Rodina), Czech Republic (Freedom and Direct Democracy), Estonia (Ekre), Belgium (VB), Denmark (Df), Finland (Fp), Germany (AfD) and Austria (Fpo)."
" Not the Social Democrats. Only the Danish People's Party. I was hoping that Brexit could be a wake-up call for European politicians, but it wasn't at all. I believe we must rethink the whole role of the West in the world and reverse globalisation."
" Not the least of these are the anti-euro Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the The European Parliament elected in 2009 has just over 10% of committed Eurosceptics, of which one third are on the left of the left (European United Left Group) and two thirds on the right of the right (Europe Liberté and Non-attached Groups including the FN). Together with the new opposition parties, they could take 20% of the House according to the latest estimates (around 150 seats out of 751)."
" Not to talk about a better Brexit deal, but about how the UK can stay within the EU. In return, believes Van Dalen, who sits in the same euro group as May's Conservatives on behalf of the CU-SGP, Brussels must promise that further European political integration will come to an end. Marcel de Graaff, PVV euro faction leader, is happy that May's deal was voted down by British parliamentarians. ,,Brussels never wanted to offer a good win-win deal to London. It had to and would become an agreement that would scare other countries considering an exit from the EU. For years, his PVV party advocated a Nexit: the Netherlands out of the EU."
" November 2012. The Schüssel I government did not fail as a result of Haider's destructive obstructionism, but due to the fact that FPÖ Vice-Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer shamelessly lied to the Freedom Party base, specifically the party conference delegates, on the question of the Czech Republic's accession to the EU and, contrary to the will of the party base, wanted to agree to the Czech Republic's accession to the EU despite the continued existence of the Benegsh Decrees. At the FPÖ federal party congress in April 2002, she had clearly stated that the FPÖ would not agree to Czech accession to the EU as long as the Czech Republic adhered to the Benegsh Decrees and the law on impunity for the crimes committed against the Sudeten Germans. At the same time, she had already agreed with Chancellor Schüssel that the FPÖ would be content with a formal protest and would not offer any real opposition to EU enlargement."

" November, however, has only symbolic significance; the problem areas of Cyprus and fundamental rights in particular continue to stand in the way of rapid success in negotiations. EU Enlargement Commissioner tefan Füle welcomed the move, as did Green MEP Ulrike Lunacek. FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache saw it as a wrong signal. EU Parliamentarian Hans-Peter Martin also reacted negatively."
" Now 52 percent are opposed. Just before the British referendum on a Brexit, it was 46 percent. Only PVV voters remain massively in favor.. View the original page:"
" Now DF also sees opportunities for Denmark in a no. But what exactly does Denmark need a British no for? DF counting on goodbye to Cameron Denmark's largest Eurosceptic party no longer identifies with Nigel Farage & Co, although Morten Messerschmidt shared a group with Ukip in the European Parliament until the 2014 elections.Today, the DFs sit instead in a group led by the British Conservatives, who are deeply divided on the issue of the EU and whose scepticism is more pragmatic."

" Now he's trying to get an economic area commissioner, probably competition or industry-agriculture. But it will not be easy, since Salvini is the president of the strongest sovereignist group, which includes the French Le Pen and the German Alternative.And it asks, the League, to appoint in Italy in the yellow-green government, a minister of European policies, in place of Paolo Savona, passed to the Consob. Something obvious, but the name that Salvini has made is certainly not pleasant to many: the economist Alberto Bagnai, always Eurosceptic and contrary to the single currency (see his book Il tramonto dell'euro, 2012) and, in fact, closer to the stars than to the League."
" Now it is him, guided by the Polish raison d'état and patriotism (I know: pathos), who will do everything possible to stop the process of pulling Poland out of the EU and limit the losses. On the 60th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, Polish democrats who grew out of the spirit of &bdquo;Solidarity watch in horror as the PiS government squanders the achievements of the last 27 years of transformation and 13 years of EU membership. Prof."
" Now, as senior adviser to the pro-European think-tank Europa, he has written a paper on the issue. The Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten, Liberal Alliance and the People's Movement against the EU reached a joint agreement in September, in which they set out a new path if Danes vote no on 3 December.Here we will vote on whether to keep the legal reservation or replace it with an opt-in system that allows Parliament to decide which parts of the EU's judicial cooperation Denmark should be part of."
" OVERVIEW FPÖ names deadline for debate on EU exit After the Viennese FPÖ leader Dominik Nepp had initiated an EU exit debate in a press interview on Friday, FPÖ EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky followed up on Saturday and even named a deadline for this debate by the end of 2021. If the EU has not taken a different direction by then, there will have to be a discussion about leaving."

" Objective criticism - also of George Soros - must of course be possible, but it must never fuel anti-Semitic resentment. The EU Council Presidency is coming up. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) likes to present itself as emphatically pro-European, while the Freedom Party (FPÖ) sits in Brussels in a parliamentary group that is also largely opposed to the EU. Are you afraid that your coalition partner will embarrass you?"
" October, there would have to be some clarification on the country's EU course. He sees the ÖVP almost on the most defensive edge. The EU partners had expressed concerns that the EU-sceptical right-wing populists could again gain momentum through the FPÖ. A government participation of the Freedom Party would be particularly stupid in this respect. Juncker urged his colleagues to agree on a concrete roadmap for reform, so that on the 30th of June, a new government could be formed."
" Of course also and especially from the Greens. But Van der Bellen has now declared several times that in the case of the FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache, among other things because of his EU scepticism, he would not entrust him with the formation of a government even if he had relatively the most votes. Of course, this argument could be used by a President Hofer at any time."
" Of course, this also offers a backdoor for the coalition partner. The rabble-rouser Harald Vilimsky, architect of an alliance with Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini, thus has a monopoly on anti-EU votes.The agitation for this has just reached a new low: On an FPÖ poster for the planned non-payment of family allowances to foreigners, two veiled women rejoice over transferred euro-hundreds - although more than 90 per cent of the cuts would affect Eastern Europeans.Just like the CSU, the short Austrian People's Party currently has more to fear from the displeasure of many Christian Democratic and liberal voters (articulated, for example, in the opposition of Christian Konrad, Michael Landau and Reinhold Mitterlehner) than from the opposition."
" Of the twelve points in the petition for a referendum on foreigners initiated by the FPÖ in 1993, not a single one concerned Islam - it was exclusively about immigration from Eastern Europe. Now that the Eastern Europeans have joined the EU and are partly governed by national populists, the rejection of Islamism (alongside criticism of alleged EU regulatory frenzy) offers a platform for cooperation.Speaking of Eastern Europe: The importance of the FPÖ at the European level is also related to its good connection to Budapest. Italy's deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, who leads the right-wing populist Lega, wants to lure the illiberal Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán into his parliamentary group, which also includes the FPÖ and Marine Le Pen's French Rassemblement National (RN)."
" On Friday evening, Lars Løkke gave the final thumbs down to Kristian Thulesen Dahl's (DF) demand for a reintroduction of the border controls adopted in 2011. Denmark's obligations to the Schengen cooperation and free movement within the EU are, according to Denmark's future prime minister, blocking the Danish People's Party's wish, Lars Løkke explained. EU law blocks the DF's demand for permanent border controls, says Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V)."
" On Friday, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) announced that a Europe-wide Grand Alliance for Free Fatherlands and Against EU Centralism had been formed from 16 parties. The French Rassemblement National under Marine Le Pen, Vox from Spain and the Polish and Hungarian governing parties PiS and Fidesz are among them. The AfD is missing. One of the reasons, apart from the AfD's unclear future, is that, unlike those other right-wing parties, it does not call for the retention of an (albeit completely changed) EU in its election manifesto, but for Germany to leave."
" On GeenStijl, by far the majority of the posts that appear about the association treaty are still negative. The other initiators, The EU Citizens Committee and the Forum for Democracy, are outright opposed to the association agreement and call on citizens to reject the agreement with Ukraine. 5. Who are the opponents of the association agreement?"
" On March 1, prior to a summit of European government leaders, he and Schultz will meet. This, according to the Prime Minister, had been agreed upon before the commotion surrounding the PVV action.The PVV called on Dutch citizens to report all kinds of complaints about Poles and other immigrants from EU countries ranging from alcohol abuse to the nicking of jobs. So far, Rutte has refused to condemn the action, even though governments in Central and Eastern Europe say it is discriminatory and denigrating."
" On Wednesday, FPÖ leader and Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache travelled to Brussels for the first time as a member of the government. As the responsible federal minister, he took part in the Council meeting of sports ministers, which raised the question in conversation with Austrian correspondents: If the FPÖ calls for limiting the EU to its core competences in view of Brexit, wouldn't this Council formation be one of the first candidates for deletion? Strache does not want to go quite so far as to abolish the Council of Sports Ministers in the spirit of austerity and subsidiarity: True, there is no legislation here, but there is the formation of wills. Accord in this area is important."
" On another EU Presidency topic, the EU's rapprochement with the Western Balkans, there is only one common ground: the ÖVP and the FPÖ are in favour of Serbia's EU accession. The foreign minister nominated by the FPÖ also stands up for the remaining Western Balkan countries, not so some FPÖ politicians. Strache criticises the state recognition of Kosovo. The FPÖ EU mandatary Obermayr is against Albania being admitted to the EU.Different attitude towards Russia."
" On the FN side, taxes on imports and on the hiring of foreigners If the exit from the European Union remained central to the FN's programme, it was because it wanted to abolish this text. Above all, the FN candidate considers that it is necessary to leave the euro to protect the French."
" On the basis of politically incorrect expressions and with room for transverse thinkers. In line with the Forum for Democracy and PVV political parties, ON is anti-immigrant, EU-critical and against policies that disadvantage unvaccinated people. One of ON's founders, Haye van der Heijden, said in late 2019 that Holocaust deniers are also allowed to speak, but that's where the line is drawn for Karskens."
" On the contrary, the alternative is both complicated and uncertain. Danish voters must, according to the Japanese agreement, by the first quarter of 2016, vote on whether Denmark should join 22 EU legal acts, covering for example the EU police cooperation Europol and common rules against for example counterfeiting and paedophilia. The Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten and Liberal Alliance criticise the Japanese parties for abusing the popular police cooperation to sneak a number of new policy areas into the package, but that does not change the fact that they will recommend a no to common rules that sound sensible and citizen-oriented to many Danes.A large majority of 61 percent in a recent Megafon poll prefer an opt-in system in the field of justice to the current legal reservation."
" On the contrary, we believe that we must control our borders. We want a strong common strategy to defend those of Europe, unlike the NR. Frontex (1) must be strengthened, and asylum applications must be made outside European soil. This will allow each country to determine its migration policy according to its reception capacity."
" On the contrary. A bit of struggle mobilises - and that can only be good for the FPÖ in particular. After all, EU sceptics tend to be more lazy about voting.Apropos flair for staging - another quick PS: The ÖVP has chosen an interesting time to announce its list."
" On the contrary: in past periods, FPÖ MPs were always lazy when it came to parliamentary reports or the preparation of parliamentary statements. FPÖ MEPs are de facto not present in Strasbourg or Brussels when it comes to active lobbying. Moreover, the Freedom Party is not only on the far right of the political spectrum, but also stands in the way of sensible regulations in the banking sector or in climate protection. The bottom line is that it harms Austrians even more, who rightly say: I am one of the losers in globalisation."
" On the issue of justice, he added recalling the alliance with Berlusconi and Meloni, we start from different positions. But then on his candidacy at the Viminale, which would meet with many perplexities at the Quirinale, Salvini has raised the bar: If the government starts the League must have a free hand to protect the security of the Italians. And even on the EU assessments are not overlapping: We are aware that the international deadlines require us to do soon, said Di Maio. Either the external constraints are rediscussed or the dream book is made here, Salvini says instead."
" On the issue of the reception of refugees, the Socialist spokesman stated that Spain clearly fails and is in the caboose because it has only fulfilled 10% of its commitments; and, finally, he referred to the level of fiscal austerity applied to Greece, Italy, Portugal or Spain, which has generated social injustice and has been counterproductive for economic growth and the reduction of inequalities. Much harsher was the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, for whom the history of the EU is that of a failure of a political project. Iglesias recalled that his party was the only one to campaign in the UK against Brexit, but made a relentless criticism against the European Union since the Maastricht Treaty."
" On the other hand, he fears that the Dutch influence on developments in Europe is diminishing. The radical choice of the PVV for an exit of the Netherlands from the European Union may be a stroke of luck.. It forces the VVD to make a clearer choice and offers a chance to push the PVV to the political margins."
" On the other hand, the FPÖ had already scaled back its EU-critical rhetoric, because in a climate marked by Brexit shock and Trump, little popularity can be gained with anti-European policies. The FPÖ has hardly changed into a pro-EU Paul. Rather, it is to be expected that the old scepticism will resurface if the mood should tip again."
" On the other hand, the way in which the 5 Star Movement moves in Italy, with the attacks on the single currency, are by no means isolated. A Northern League in crisis tries to recover ground by hooking up with Marine Le Pen's French Front National, enemy of the EU of bureaucrats and banks.And Forza Italia and sectors of the PD oscillate between the no to the respect of European constraints and the request for their revision; however, they criticize what has been done so far."
" On the second, however, there are problems and serious ones, since in what the political scientist Jean-Yves Camus calls the great Eurosceptic, populist or right-wing extremist magma the positions are very different. In short, in Europe there are at least fifty shades of right-wing (always Camus, who is also witty). Le Pen already has four certain allies: the Dutch Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, her lifelong friend, the Austrian Fpö, the Flemish Belgian independentists of the Vlaams Belang and those of Matteo Salvini's League of Padania, of which Madame Le Pen always speaks with great sympathy.Then there are the parties with which she will not make the alliance, divided into two categories: those with whom she does not want to make it and those who do not want to make it with her. In the first category, the parties that are unpresentable even for the FN, also because they would endanger its policy of dediabolisation that has cleared it with French voters."
" On to Paris and Berlin Iin the finale of the coalition negotiations between the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), the question arises as to which EU course the future government will take. So far, a lot of fuss has been made about very specific domestic issues - the reintroduction of school grades, the twelve-hour day, chamber membership, most recently the smoking ban."
" Once he lost self-control in this context when he blurted out in the first ORF discussion: You will be surprised what will go. 3) Even if one does not (want to) take all this so seriously, one thing remains relevant for the bourgeois: Hofer has repeatedly raised the possibility of Austria leaving the EU by referendum (Öxit). In January 2015 he voted for a corresponding FPÖ motion (for a referendum). The conditions for this ( if the EU does not abandon centralism , if Turkey joins ) are pretended."
" Once he was against Europe and the euro, today he defends them (like most of his electorate).Perhaps he should leave the European sovereignist group (Identity and Democracy) and join the Popular Party (which may need the votes of the League to elect as president the popular Ursula von der Leyen). If in this party, which has certainly shifted to the right in no small measure with respect to the past, there is also Orban, why couldn't Salvini be there? Also because Europe's opinion of the League has recently softened and Salvini must foster relations between Italy and the EU, also in order to obtain orders and investments from the countries of the continent in our economy. A rapprochement with the Ppe would constitute an important step for the League."

" One comes from Brussels and sees Europe as a big, unbeatable company with little problems here and there. And the other is that of Eurosceptics such as Marine Le Pen, Salvini, Brexit supporters in the UK and even Vox in Spain, who basically see the European Union as the scapegoat for all ills. It is Mephistopheles."
" One complication with this is that the mediators both have different preferences: Rutte has aligned himself with Verhofstadt, Lindner is in the Rehn camp. In the meantime, the Eurosceptic parties - such as Geert Wilders' PVV, Frenchwoman Marine Le Pen's Front National and Briton Nigel Farage's Ukip - are keeping their powder dry for a while. According to the forecasts, these parties will soon gain many seats in the European Parliament."
" One could make this out to be an isolated case. But it obviously goes deeper, the campaign continues on the FPÖ website. Does the FPÖ want to blow up the EU Presidency? The chancellor is silent. He did not think it was worth apologising to the head of the Commission."
" One criticises the Network Enforcement Act for interfering with freedom of expression and violating constitutional rights. In the second motion, the AfD parliamentary group demands that an action plan of the EU Commission against disinformation be rejected. This plan impedes freedom of expression and its unhindered dissemination."
" One of the EU's principal problems is that elites in Brussels, as well as their cheerleaders in the wider body politic and sections of the media, fail to countenance any critique of the European project and label anyone with a different vision for Europe a Eurosceptic when nothing could, in fact, be further from the truth. Sinn Féin believes that Ireland's place is in Europe but that the direction of the EU has been, and is, misguided.Instead of a Europe of deeper concentration of power in a centre that is unaccountable and fails to respect national sovereignty, we want to see a social Europe that place citizens at the centre and acts in their interests."
" One should not mess around after leaving politics, Gusenbauer said. This was contrasted by the appearance of FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who spouted anti-EU slogans in Linz: I don't want us to degenerate into an EU sect, said Strache, who promoted more direct democracy. Strache emphasised that he wanted to become Chancellor of the Hearts for all Austrians."
" One thing is clear: we are critical of banks, but not anti-bank,"" Nepp says on his way to the next meeting in the financial district. After all, the FPÖ is also critical of the EU, but not anti-EU. Banks are players in the market."
" Only a small blue miracle Despite high gains, the FPÖ ended up in third place A blue earthquake is what FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had hoped for in the EU elections, and with an increase of 7.4 per cent compared to 2009, his party thus managed to get 20.1 per cent of the votes cast. This probably means the largest gain in mandates among the parties; after the election cards have been counted, it is considered highly probable that the FPÖ will gain two more seats in the EU Parliament and thus four mandates."
" Only allow those who are useful and nice to immigrate, only admit refugees for a limited period of time and do not allow them to immigrate permanently. This list of demands can be found in all right-wing and right-wing populist parties in Europe, from the FPÖ, SVP and UKIP to the Front National and the AfD. Like Trump, they also serve this content partly with xenophobic garnishes."
" Only one in ten has concerns that PiS could lead to a Polexit. That is, PiS voters believed Kaczynski when he declared in an interview that there will be no Polexit, it is a propaganda invention that has been used against us many times, we want to be in the EU, but at the same time we want to remain a sovereign state. TVP and Polskie Radio - media taken over by PiS in 2016. - this is how the words and actions of the leaders of the Law and Justice party are described."
" Only that by standing in front of the Sejm, they are more effective in mobilizing sympathy for the protesters than if they were talking to them in the building. The combination of fear and helplessness can also be seen in the conflict with the EU. Contrary to PiS's triumphant assurances that the EU would step down immediately, Brussels has demanded real restoration of the rule of law in Poland. Power is increasingly afraid of the consequences of its failure."
" Opinion polls since suggest that number would increase in the event of another vote. Intriguingly, it is being suggested now by some of those polls that a majority of people in the North might opt to join a united Ireland in order to remain in the EU.Sinn Féin, once implacably opposed to Ireland's membership of the European Union but now committed to it, sees this as an opportunity to bring about a united Ireland.Ironically, Sinn Féin is being helped in this by the behaviour of the Democratic Unionist Party, which wants to reject the Brexit deal that Theresa May has negotiated with the European Union - one which gives the North an economic advantage over the remainder of the United Kingdom - in favour of an inferior outcome."
" Opinions among Europe's right-wing parties already differ widely on the further timetable. The most cautious is a group around the AfD and the Austrian FPÖ. Here they are thinking of a three-step scenario. First, the EU should treat the exiting Britons kindly. Then the EU would have to transform itself into a less solid association of sovereign nation states."
" Opinions were confirmed and sometimes reinforced. Harry van Bommel (SP) and Raymond de Roon (PVV) - always opposed to the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine - were still against it afterwards. And the proponents, Han ten Broeke (VVD), Michiel Servaes (PvdA), Sjoerd Sjoerdsma (D66), Rik Grashoff (GroenLinks), for their part, were still in favor of the treaty that aims to strengthen ties between Ukraine and the Union."
" Opposition files joint lawsuit against EU fiscal pact FPÖ, Greens and BZÖ fear that the budgetary sovereignty of the National Council will be curtailed.[Vienna/APA/Red.] The opposition agreed on a joint constitutional complaint against the fiscal compact on Thursday."
" Or it agrees with the EU summit demand and for the extension of the Russia sanctions. In the EU Parliament, it is assumed that the FPÖ will give in. According to Othmar Karas, head of the ÖVP delegation, a blue veto would be a breach of constitutional conformity in Austria, which is the basis of government policy in the EU. The validity of the Minsk Agreement has legal status."
" Or of deliberately planned famines and mass deportations. But Brussels is the new Moscow, the PVVers know. Why? Because the EU is forcing things on its member states against their will and taking away sovereignty, and isn't that exactly what Stalin did? No, of course not, thinks the historically educated reader."
" Or: The FPÖ head of delegation in the EU Parliament, Andreas Mölzer, is in favour of a financial transaction tax in principle. Condition: It should only not be the nucleus of an EU tax. Kolm, on the other hand, is against the introduction of any new taxes. The FPÖ is also against the free market when it comes at the expense of (Austrian) dairy farmers: no monitoring body has been introduced that could react in case of market inequalities, criticises EU mandatary Franz Obermayr. A price competition is being set in motion that will ruin the dairy farmers in the long run."
" Orbán tinkering with new right-wing group in European Parliament Orbán tinkering with new right-wing group in European Parliament International alliance of EU sceptics including FPÖ would be second largest grouping International alliance of EU sceptics including FPÖ would be second largest grouping Strasbourg/Budapest/Vienna Bang effect in the European Parliament: After the pugnacious Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán withdrew the twelve Fidesz MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (EPP) last week, there has been movement in the efforts to found a right-wing group in Strasbourg: The Fidesz leader reportedly wants to set up a group uniting the European Conservatives and Democrats (ECR), the extreme right-wing group Identity and Democracy (ID), Fidesz and other parties."
" Other people present at the talk were completely surprised. Indeed, publicly the prime minister insisted on the economic importance of the euro, in response to the PVV's call for an immediate exit from the eurozone and the EU.."
" Otherwise, he probably would not have tried to promote, with an article in Il Messaggero of June 8, the candidacy of his former French commissioner and former number one at the WTO, Pascal Lamy, for the Barroso chair. It would have spared submerged poisons circulated in the EU Palaces in relation to Lamy well seen by powerful lobbies interested in influencing the mega EU / US free trade agreement. Or harsh reactions on the hypothesis of the former WTO, such as that of the leader and MEP of the League Matteo Salvini, who called it madness because if, in the face of citizens, are imposed names of representatives of banks, finance and multinationals, we are ready to break the tables in Brussels and Strasbourg.Juncker"

" Othmar Karas best top candidate, FPÖ has near-monopoly on EU opponents Election Day poll. The Sora Institute asked about the motives for voting."
" Othmar Karas is also captain of the team this time, says the ÖVP. However, it has adopted an internal rule according to which only those persons who receive the most preferential votes are to enter the EU Parliament.Coalition partner FPÖ, meanwhile, has chosen Karas as its main opponent in the election campaign. The latter was an eternal EU centralist and acted in an anti-government manner, Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache declared on Friday at the party conference of the Tyrolean FPÖ."
" Otten's program, hijacked by Baudet, I'm going to execute nicely, she says. While FvD in Brussels does not know whether it is for or against leaving the Union, Rookmaker is clear: she is against a Nexit.She states she doesn't want to think too much about when she can finally take her seat."
" Our country would then have to conclude bilateral trade treaties with the EU, as Switzerland already does. As long as we are still members of the Union, the PVV wants the EU flag to disappear from public buildings in any case, starting with the Lower House. The PVV also opposes the European emergency fund ESM.What complicates cooperation with right-wing parties?"
" Our data from the Polish General Election Survey show that this percentage among the PiS electorate is much higher than among the electorates of other parties, as is the participation of PiS voters in culture. The big problem is that behind the conglomeration of confabulations, lies about the last years and the last 25 years in general, we have not heard at all a vision of what PiS is aiming at. Everything is defined negatively: the EU, liberal democracy, political elites, but not a word - a meaningful word, anyway - about what they want to build.What you get out of their statements is a picture of a lonely Poland that doesn't need the EU, the Germans, it's not clear at all with whom and where we should go."
" Our homeland is an integral part of the European Union and the common currency, the euro, for example, can be read there, as well as an oath of allegiance to the European community of values. Kurz also wrestled approval for Ceta, the EU free trade agreement with Canada, from the FPÖ, as well as a principled advocacy for the EU admission of the Western Balkan states.But this new government will shed the role of the European model pupil."
" Our population here is less than 3pc of the UK, so it seems we don't matter when the bigger decisions are being made. We must show we are not going to stand by while our island and our economy is devastated and divided by Brexit.Sinn Féin's leader in the North Michelle O'Neill, who attended the protest, said: Clearly we need special status - we are building momentum and that argument is resonating across Europe...DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: While others are content to moan we want to see delivery happen and we are confident she (Mrs May) will make that happen."
" PEOPLE'S VOTE DF chairman criticises Lars Løkke for devious EU pact with Thorning. LA doubts that Løkke has the courage for a choice on EU reservation.Men Danish People's Party chairman, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, is particularly interested in the fact that Lars Løkke wants a broader formulation of where Denmark should stand on EU issues in the future with the pact he is about to conclude with Thorning. Lars Løkke says to Politiken: It is important that an agreement is based on a broad platform that locks some key parts of Danish European policy."
" POLITICAL ANALYSIS The DF's ministerial dreams grow in line with bourgeois EU scepticism. Until now, the Left Party has had the clear excuse that it could not sit in government with the Danish People's Party, because EU policy divides.That argument is being watered down by both sides."
" POLITICAL ANALYSIS Threat to oppose a new referendum on Europol creates unrest. Who dares to ask the Danes about the EU without the Danish People's Party?For Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V) it may be inconvenient that his own rapporteur starts the discussion about a possible referendum already now, when Løkke is under heavy attack from the DF for not betting wholeheartedly on getting a parallel agreement in place, but the logic is not disagreed with by the Prime Minister.A lot has happened since December, and what was cool logic then has become politically sensitive."
" POLITICS MEANS A strong social voice is needed in the new EU. In an interview with TV 2 News yesterday, President Kristian Thulesen Dahl made it a condition of government participation that there be a Danish referendum on the unknown deal that Britain and the EU might one day reach.DF believes that the Danish government should help the British get as many EU goods as possible without paying for them, while the prime minister has said that Denmark should not just blindly negotiate in Britain's favour.While the DF has described how the EU of the future looks like to them - greatly scaled down with f."
" POLITICS MEANS Enhedslisten, DF and LA demand referendum. The result will be a new EU referendum.On patent rules! BOTH Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti claim to be concerned with creating Danish jobs. And the 'Liberal Alliance' is supposedly in favour - without hesitation and political bureaucracy - of ensuring flexible rules for the benefit of both business and employment, i.e. growth."
" PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos rejected the amendment because this strategy does not mean in any way to be in favor of a commercialized education, as explained the socialist Manuel Cruz. We are part of the EU and it seems surreal and adolescent to say that we want to get out of the 2020 objectives, especially because, when it comes to requesting European funding, I do not know how it will be achieved outside the framework of these objectives, said Marta Martin, of C's. I meet with the educational community and I do not perceive that it is against the 2020 Strategy. It sets out lines of action that allow us to improve the Spanish education system. This is a puerile, limited and not very responsible debate, added Sandra Moneo, of the PP.So the text will remain as it was: The subcommittee will prepare a report on the state and situation of the Spanish education system containing a diagnosis with proposals and conclusions that will be gathered for the elaboration of a great State, Social and Political Pact for Education, to achieve the European educational objectives set out in the EU Education and Training 2020 Strategy. And Unidos Podemos, consequently, abstained, instead of voting in favor. So did Bildu, ERC, PNV, PdeCat and Bildu."
" Pablo Iglesias' speech in Congress last Wednesday is an example of the calculated ambiguity with which populists usually act. Presenting himself as a fervent Europeanist, the leader of Podemos questioned the foundations of the creation of the EU, reducing it to a provoked effect of the Cold War, emphasized that countries that do not have the euro overcome crises better, ridiculed the Maastricht Treaty and the failed EU constitution, described the European project as a failure for being at the service of the interests of Germany and, defining himself as a patriot, questioned the cession of sovereignty in favor of the community institutions. A discourse that coincides with that of Le Pen or Wilders himself, who consciously avoids that supranational bodies based on social and economic cooperation are the best tool to face the challenges imposed by a global reality.The results of the Dutch elections are encouraging, but we must not lower our guard to prevent populism from continuing to spread, because in its seed lies the liquidation of the model of prosperity and security that Europe has enjoyed since the end of World War II."
" Party leader Reinhold Mitterlehner, who himself is no friend of the Russia sanctions, called the timing of the trip grossly misguided and so insensitive, referring to the fighting in Syria with Russian participation. All they need is to go to Aleppo,"" the Vice-Chancellor said. His General Secretary Werner Amon, who in view of the FPÖ's anti-EU stance was most recently in theSTANDARD"
" Party leader Strache and top candidate Vilimsky warn against open borders, a bloated apparatus of EU bureaucracy and a Merkel-Macron course in Europe. And they are counting on the popularity of the domestic government's policy: the FPÖ is the only party that also represents the government's course in the EU election campaign. This is a jab at the coalition partner, or more precisely, at ÖVP top candidate Othmar Karas."
" Paus welcomes this, but demands that nuclear power and fossil fuels be consistently excluded here. The SPD, FDP and Left also support the EU plan in principle. The AfD, on the other hand, fears that this will turn into a manipulation of investors in the guise of supposed climate protection, as their financial policy spokesman Albrecht Glaser puts it. Under no circumstances should sustainable investment become compulsory."
" Pechtold cleverly exploited VVD MP Verheyen's comment that pro-EU politicians would be more dangerous than Marine Le Pen. Outrageous remark, Pechtold spoke, after which he could talk about Le Pen, Dewinter and Strache. In this way, he killed two birds with one stone: disapproving of controversial PVV contacts and simultaneously drawing attention to D66's EU positions.And GreenLeft? GreenLeft also abhors right-wing extremism."
" People were caught off guard for a moment, including me. When I took a snapshot of the EU position on Forum for Democracy's website in March, it still said that the EU is unreformable, so that the FvD favors a NEXIT. This last phrase appears to have been quietly deleted: the spot now reads that the party favors a referendum on EU membership."
" Perhaps Eskil Nielsen himself has forgotten to be thorough, because there is precisely an exemption clause in the directive to which he refers, which states that the rules do not prevent Member States from adopting safety regulations. Kenneth Kristensen Berth (KKB), the DF's EU spokesman, also lashes out at the European Think Tank on 27 May. He even claims that the EU cannot escape responsibility for the accident."
" Perhaps surprisingly, the spokespersons of the Social Democratic Party, the Danish People's Party, the Radicals, the Social Democrats and the Greens agree with the criticism. Jan Callesen (DF) joins the criticism of the government's implementation of the EU's Personal Data Regulation, even though his own party is voting for it: I also do not understand why a minister alone should be able to make an order on the use of data for another purpose."
" Perhaps the lawyers will consider that this is not a surrender of sovereignty that can trigger a referendum under Article 20 of the Constitution. But what do Danish voters and politicians say, not least from Eurosceptic parties like the Danish People's Party and Enhedslisten? Politics is not just about what you can defend legally.Helle Thorning must choose whether or not to include Denmark in the EU Court's surveillance."
" Perhaps, in a world dominated by large sovereignist countries (America, UK, Russia) and liberal communists in foreign policy (China), Brussels seems less stepmotherly. In Scotland, after Brexit, the desire to remain in the EU has become one of the flags of independence. In Italy, however, the party (the League) that more than any other pushes for autonomy and currently expresses the presidents of Lombardy and Veneto sees prevailing inside the anti-European and no-euro drives. One of two things."
" PiS voters are opponents of leaving the EU. Such numbers deprive PiS of room for maneuver in an election year. PiS's change of narrative on the EU is the second such case in which, due to unequivocal public opposition, this party makes a radical turn and abandons its political goals. The first was the abandonment of the tightening of the anti-abortion law, which also enjoyed the support of only about"
" PiS voters outside the cities are not as interested in the fate of the European Parliament and some of them may stay home. The radical opponents of the EU will go to the polls, but they will vote not for PiS, but for small anti-EU parties. This will also weaken the ruling party."
" PiS's alliance with Eurosceptics is losing relevance Because of the decision of the British people in a referendum to vote for Britain's exit from the European Union, PiS politicians are off to the races criticizing the European Union and its institutions. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the Law and Justice party, has no doubt who is at fault and who should be held responsible for Brexit: - A particularly grim role was played by Donald Tusk, who led the negotiations with the British and basically led to the fact that they did not get anything, so he bears direct responsibility for Brexit and should disappear from European politics, but this applies to the entire European Commission in its current composition.Presidential minister Andrzej Dera in an interview with Rzeczpospolita lamented: If Prime Minister Szydlo's voice had been listened to, Brexit would not have happened, but the EU elites are deaf and blind to these voices."
" Podemos, the Government's main partner, insists that the Executive must repeal the Budgetary Stability Law, something the Government refuses to do because it understands that it would be breaking with Brussels. The Executive is convinced that there is room for left-wing policies without clashing with the EU because the Socialist Government managed to extend the deficit target from 1.3% of GDP to 1.8%. Podemos demands the repeal of the law because it is the daughter of the new Article 135 of the Constitution, which made the payment of the debt a priority.The Government is surprised by the hardness that Podemos is exhibiting in the last hours, after the Executive responded very positively to the document that the formation made public last week."

" Poland, Lithuania, Latvia or Hungary fear the dismissal of employees because they would then no longer have a competitive advantage with their services in Western European states. Because of possible negative influences on the domestic meat market, FPÖ agricultural spokesman Max Linder announced a rejection of the EU's trade agreement with the Mercosur countries in the National Council. As long as our crisis-stricken agriculture is not in a better position, we can certainly not agree to such an agreement, said Linder in a statement."
" Polish interests must be protected, because Poland is being spit upon, we must defend it. According to the president, those who flaunt Polish money, who spend everything to go mainstream, are not patriots. - here Kaczynski was referring to Friday's speech of Prime Minister Tusk, who presented the Polish position before the EU budget summit and rejected the idea of a lone veto if Poland were to get less money from the EU. According to the Law and Justice president, the Polish people deserve these funds. - This is our right resulting from Polish history - he said."
" Political action is needed to end the waste, write the two students. And won't the government be ready to deliver soon, when it gets its SU reform through? The Left and DF are worried that foreign students will flock to Denmark after the EU has established their right to SU.. The two parties also believe that the government's calculations - which show that the EU ruling will cost an additional DKK 200 million a year - are far too low."
" Political scientists gave this new way of doing politics the attribute right-wing populist. Herbert Kickl is thus the first purely right-wing populist frontman of the FPÖ. The central theme is that of identity, immigration, and to some extent criticism of the EU. Kickl has expanded it to include Corona."
" Politics for the people by the people, in the form of direct democracy, has replaced the politics of riding roughshod over 2015, thus putting a stop to disinterest, frustration and declining voter turnout. The countries have also gained a new self-confidence as sovereign, self-determined states by reducing the EU to its core competences. This would be the FPÖ's path for Austria. To achieve this, however, the course must be set today."
" Pollsters and political scientists are pretty much in agreement: on the evening of Sunday 25 May, when the last Italian polling station closes the polling booth, one in five of the 751 seats in the Strasbourg parliament could go to anti-European parties, such as the Front National in France, Ukip in the United Kingdom or the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands.On the far right, electoral capital is quickly squandered, and while these parties are poised to make significant gains from one election to the next, others could fall sharply, such as the Flemish nationalists of Vlaams Belang, or the ultranationalist Hungarians of Jobbik."
" Populism is popping up everywhere. We saw what happened with Brexit, then people like Marine Le Pen emerged, like Nigel Farage, like the AfD in Germany, and similar things are happening in other countries. A national populism has emerged here that goes against European values, against the rule of law, against the primacy of the law and against respect for people's rights."
" Precisely, one of the arguments used by Brexit advocates was to prevent European court rulings from being applied in the United Kingdom. From Brexit to SpaxitFor the moment, Vox has not gotten that far. Although the hashtag #Spaxit has become popular among its supporters on social networks, the leaders of the ultra party have not dared to openly propose Spain's exit from the EU."
" Prelude to the EU Election: FPÖ relies on Karas' replacement The attack on the new coalition partner ÖVP was well-considered, calm, unequivocal and brutal: ""I see Head of Delegation Othmar Karas acting in absolute contradiction to his party,"" said Harald Vilimsky in a Standard interview last week on the sidelines of the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.The FPÖ General Secretary is himself an MEP in his second function and, like Karas, is also head of delegation for a total of four Freedom Party MEPs, all of whom are members of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF)."
" President In Austria, the NGOs Attac, Greenpeace and Global 2000, which like the Greens and the FPÖ had fought against EU free trade agreements, were particularly pleased to receive support from Luxembourg. The Federation of Austrian Industry also expressed its satisfaction."
" President Jaroslaw Kaczynski swears that absolutely no one in his camp thinks about taking Poland out of the EU structures. The position of the Law and Justice party can also be explained in this way: those in power do not want to leave the EU, but they do not want the EU to interfere in the changes they are making to the judiciary. Admittedly, Krystyna Pawlowicz calls the EU flag a rag, but this is just the kind of folklore that is meant to ensure the PiS camp's allegiance among anti-EU and nationalist voters."
" Previously, PVV leader Wilders tried in the House of Representatives and later through summary proceedings against the state to delay ratification of the treaty until after the elections. That resistance was fruitless and in part misleading, because it is falsely claimed by the PVV that it is about handing over even more sovereignty to Brussels.The so-called European Stability Mechanism (ESM), however, is an initiative of the euro countries themselves and is not part of the EU treaties."
" Prime Minister Marjan Sarec speaks of a sign of mistrust. Slovenia has been resisting border controls since they were introduced three years ago. FPÖ Secretary General Harald Vilimsky, meanwhile, declares: As long as the EU's external border is not effectively protected, the abolition of internal border controls is out of the question. Even France extended"
" Prime Minister Rutte has flirted far too much with the British. PVV leader Geert Wilders thinks the cabinet should also hold a referendum on the EU in the Netherlands. Via Twitter he says: ,,Kudos to Prime Minister Cameron for giving the British people a referendum on the EU."
" Project Failure. Useless then the commitment of the Region, with the League in the forefront: only four months ago it had sent a delegation to Brussels to the Vice-President of the EC, Antonio Tajani. Now the president of the regional council Fabrizio Cecchetti and the European MP Matteo Salvini accuse the government: Monti has once again forgotten about Milan, where the section of the court already handles the largest number of proceedings of this kind in Europe."
" Promis. For the Strasbourg elections, the RN published a 75-page document entitled ""Manifesto for the European Alliance of Nations"". The RN no longer wants to leave Europe and abandon the euro, since"
" Prosperity will increase. In ten years, the economy grows ten percent more than if the Netherlands remains in the EU. PVV leader Wilders describes the NExit report as the best news in years. The Netherlands needs oxygen, he believes, rather than the suffocations from Brussels."
" Provided that, to redraw the electoral colleges, it will take time, probably more than the two months indicated by Salvini. Meanwhile, the theme of the relationship with the European Union (and the possible exit of Italy) continues to mark a certain effervescence. The less pro-EU part of the League seems to identify Giancarlo Giorgetti as the opposing position. Although yesterday Alberto Bagnai published a photo of himself smiling with the deputy secretary of the League."
" Public servants in particular have an incentive to ensure that adequate funding is in place to avoid the fate that has befallen their counterparts in Greece. The polarisation of attitudes to the EU along class lines is already having an impact on party politics with the rise in support for Sinn Féin mirroring increasing working-class hostility to the EU.The collapse of Fianna Fáil, the great catch-all party, in last year s election may have played a decisive part in the process."
" Q.- But you are in favor of the cordon sanitaire to Vox and Vox's counterparts in Europe, because they are parties that promote some anti-European ideas? A.- We are the Europeanist party par excellence and we will never allow anyone to break the European Union. That Europeanism that the PP represents is the brake to those left-wing or right-wing populisms that are anti-European and want to break the EU. Q.- If the PP is the brake to populisms such as Vox in Europe, why not in Spain? What is the difference? A.- The Popular Party is the same in Europe and Spain. We are the only moderate and pro-European alternative to Sánchez."
" Q.- Therefore, was it a mistake to offer the extreme right of Vox to enter into a Casado's Government? A.- What Pablo Casado proposed in the general elections, if it had gone well, perhaps it would have avoided the populist drift in which Vox is going to get into after the European elections. Hundreds of thousands of Vox voters will feel ashamed when they hear his speeches in Congress, or when they see that he will end up in Le Pen's parliamentary group. Q.- Does the Spanish nationalism of Vox seem to you as harmful as the Catalan or Basque nationalism? A.- I have no doubts. Basque, Catalan, Valencian or Galician nationalism is as dangerous and pernicious as Spanish nationalism."
" RN signs 'black book' on EU vaccine strategy The 22 MEPs of the Rassemblement National (RN) have signed a new 'black book', this time criticising the European Commission's vaccine strategy. On some thirty pages, the elected representatives list what they denounce as the failings and ""neo-liberal dogmatism"" of the Union in the ordering of vaccines against Covid-19. ""Never since its creation has the European Union demonstrated its incompetence to such an extent"", attacks the head of the RN delegation in the European Parliament, Jérôme Rivière, who sees in this ""proof by the absurd"" of the dysfunction of the European supranational model."
" Rajoy's idea is to first explain the document to him, and then listen to him. Although without much hope of changing the mind of the man his party defines as Mr. No for the times he has rejected the PP's offer to join a grand constitutionalist coalition, the acting president did not hesitate to once again raise the specter of the chaos that would accompany a hypothetical PSOE government with Podemos and the independents, a radical government that would have many difficulties with the European Union as is happening to Portugal, whose risk premium is already at 400 points. Regarding the document that Rajoy sent to Sánchez and also delivered yesterday to Rivera, Hernando anticipated the response that the Socialist leader will give him today: Mr. Rajoy makes fools of us by talking about the fight against corruption and the welfare state, because, in his opinion, for four years he has done the opposite of what he has said today."

" Rather, that, as is their right, the people are wont to answer not the question put before them, but any other one preoccupying them at the time. Is the Government fighting Ireland s corner hard enough? Is the bailout unfair? Is the EU run by Berlin? Is unemployment excessive? . . . Yesterday in the Dáil, responding to Taoiseach Enda Kenny s announcement of a referendum on the EU fiscal treaty, Opposition deputies from Sinn Féin to the ULA were already lining up to redefine the issue as austerity , the iniquitous bailout , raising again the ghosts of Nice I and Lisbon I, rallying the inveterate naysayers. The Peoples opportunity to reject austerity at the ballot box , was how Socialist MEP Paul Murphy described the battle ahead."
" Red genuflection Careless as one sometimes is with regard to the SPÖ, one used to hope that the SPÖ, apart from outliers à la Niessl, would on the whole have a clarified relationship with the FPÖ: no coalition with right-wing extremist EU opponents. Now a Styrian SP regional functionary has confronted the public with the tragic truth: The SPÖ has had an unsettled relationship with the FPÖ for years, which is why, in order to remedy this state of affairs, a party-internal values committee is to define red positions and sound out possibilities under which conditions cooperation with the Freedom Party will be possible. The party must clarify the question of coalitions, which has become increasingly explosive in recent years."
" Red-blue relies on guard services in the municipalities and planned squares at the borders. If the EU does not solve the asylum problem, FPÖ leader Johann Tschürtz wants to talk about leaving.The press: You are partly already being addressed or announced as Deputy Governor, although you are not yet."
" Regular camps have not been a successful model, Sala said. Interventions for their full overcoming in coherence with the order of the EU, provides the Lega-M5S contract. Shared strategies in Milan and the rest of the country to deal with an alarm felt, but also a delicate problem."
 Rent is not included as a parameter in the catalogue of criteria presented by the EU in the competition to host the EMA. EU POLICY The government has offered to pay the EU DKK 1.7 billion in operating costs for the EU Medicines Agency. But the SF and DF have doubts about the broad support.The amount is about 34 times higher than the 49 million.
" Republican SF argues treaty a further erosion of sovereignty The party, which has opposed all EU referendums over the past 25 years, yesterday claimed the treaty would further erode Ireland s sovereignty and give the bosses in Germany total control of our financial affairs .Party president Des Dalton said the treaty was the creation of the same political and financial elites responsible for the current economic collapse. During the so-called boom, the profits of the wealthy were privatised to ensure they would not be shared with society, now during the bust they are socialising their losses, forcing people across the EU to pay for them, he told a press conference in Dublin."
" Resignation overshadows the FPÖ kick-off. The Freedom Party is focusing on the asylum issue in the EU elections and wants to overtake the SPÖ with it. But before that, they draw the consequences from the rat poem."
" Returning the money to the shareholders, i.e., those who had invested risk capital, would be quite a different matter. The opposition of Brussels would be sharper. But on this point the Lega-M5S government, assuming it is really born, is preparing for a clash. The day before being received by Visco, Conte had met with the Association of victims of the bank bailout."
 Right in the middle: the FPÖ. DER STANDARD spoke with their EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky about his foreign policy plans and the current conflicts within the EU.STANDARD: The FPÖ has signed a declaration against EU centralism together with 15 other parties. What is EU centralism supposed to be anyway?
" Right-wing parties against free trade EU Parliament. The right-wing group, which includes the FPÖ, is mobilising against TTIP and Ceta. Le Pen also wants to abolish the euro and the EU internal market."
" Right-wing parties in EU now also propagate referendums FPÖ leader Strache sees a right to an exit referendum, but does not want to actively promote it at present."
" Right-wing slogans, no consequences In the election campaign, the FPÖ again resorts to racist vocabulary and Nazi comparisons The EU election campaign is going on almost unnoticed by the public. Those who thought that this time there would be a political debate in Austria without reaching into the lowest drawers now know better: once again, Nazi trivialisation and racist slogans are being used to win votes."
" Right-wing, anti-European or even anti-European parties have not become as strong as many feared, says the economist. And the reaction to this must not be to be afraid of ambitious European policy. The fear of the AfD in the grand coalition, for example, has brought the EU to a standstill. If you sit like a rabbit in front of a snake, you make the rabbit stronger. One has to stand up to the opponents of Europe, that's why the Greens were elected."
" Romania's new foreign minister Cristian Diaconescu expressed exasperation over the Dutch 'Schengen' veto this weekend. A spokesman for Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip this morning denied a report in De Telegraaf that Ansip would address Rutte tonight about the PVV site, during a dinner with Chancellor In Brussels, European Commissioner Viviane Reding (Justice) condemned the PVV website this weekend as an open call for intolerance. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski tweeted about her statement."
" Roth said it was an overdue step towards fiscal union. Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) had also recently made it clear that the EU aid should not be seen as a one-off action. The AfD announced a constitutional complaint and called on Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier not to sign the law. In Germany, 80 percent of the money spent would have nothing to do with Corona."
" Russia sanctions first test EU summit decides on continuation, FPÖ threatens with veto A first test of the EU suitability of Turquoise-Blue is already emerging before the new government has even been sworn in. At the EU summit this Thursday, the heads of state and government will decide to extend the sanctions against Russia for another six months."
" Rübig: I don't really understand why she doesn't end it. The FPÖ is a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF), which gathers EU-sceptical parties around Marine Le Pen's Front National, which always calls for a fight against the EU. The FPÖ is a founding member, like the Lega from Italy or Geert Wilders' party from the Netherlands."

" S&P cool on Eurosceptics TH(EURO) PUNT RATING agency S&P warned grimly yesterday that EU countries might have their credit ratings downgraded if Eurosceptic parties such as Sinn Fein or Syriza take power. The good news for investors at least is that the ratings agency believes a Eurosceptic party is unlikely to win an overall majority any time soon, with the possible exception of Syriza, which leads Greek opinion polls ahead of tomorrow's general election."
" SF manifesto rails against EU yes men Sinn F)in has the established parties and Europe firmly in its sights Sinn F^8in president Gerry Adams argued against the Brussels consensus and its Irish supporters as the party published its European manifesto.While Sinn F^8in's opponents have seized on his detention by the PSNI in connection with the Jean McConville inquiry, Adams said he did not know whether the episode would damage the party's vote on Friday week."
" SF opposed new EU free-trade deal with Singapore SINN Féin's MEPs voted against a new trade deal which will gradually eliminate tariffs on goods moving between the EU and Singapore over the next five years. The party, along with Independent MEPs Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Nessa Childers, went against the landmark deal earlier this week."
" SF president says party will campaign against Britain exiting the EU SINN Féin has confirmed its plans to campaign against Britain leaving the European Union.Speaking following a strategy meeting in Dublin yesterday, party leader Gerry Adams and the North's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said they were opposed to a so-called 'Brexit'."
" SF to oppose Brexit in EU referendum campaign British exit from EU could further divide Ireland, says Sinn Féin strategy paper Sinn Féin has decided to campaign for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union because it fears a British exit could further divide the island of Ireland.The party's ardchomhairle has agreed a strategy ahead of the British referendum on EU membership expected to be held late next year."
" SPÖ against egal , ÖVP against class struggle and FPÖ for anger Vienna The SPÖ has a new slogan with which it wants to win the EU elections. In doing so, it relies on a formulation method that has so far been practised mainly by the FPÖ ( Daham instead of Islam , Deutsch instead of nix versteh n ): Social instead of indifferent proclaims the campaign presented on Friday for SPÖ top candidate Eugen Freund."
 SUNDAY's Euro-selection gave several anti-European populist parties a surprisingly big boost. 28 percent for the British Ukip. Almost as much to the Danish People's Party. 25.4 percent to the Front National in France. 51.5 percent to Hungary's ruling Fidesz party and a further 14.7 percent to the avowedly racist Jobbik.
" Salvini also assured that he would talk with everyone but ruled out any strange majority with the M5S. Abroad, FN president Marine Le Pen offered warm congratulations to Mr Salvini, while Brexit standard bearer Nigel Farage congratulated his M5S colleagues.Alas, populism has not yet reached its peak in Europe"
" Salvini and Di Maio would have opposed it, convinced that the EU will reject the maneuver anyway: there can be no turning back on the deficit at 2.4%. Explains a member of the League who is part of the government: There remains a margin of comparison with the EU, but there can be no downward bargaining that undermines growth.Conte, however, insisted on giving messages of openness to the EU: Our position is that we are in Europe, we are very comfortable in Europe. We want to exercise our state's prerogatives on the direction of economic policy, but we recognize the European institutions as our interlocutors."
" Salvini and Kaczynski will probably agree that the current EU should be dismantled and rebuilt as something like a free trade zone, without the European Commission interfering in everything. A year ago, the fact that the head of US diplomacy was persuaded to visit the rather squalid party headquarters in Nowogrodzka was supposed to prove that PiS remains in the mainstream of European politics despite its protracted dispute with the EU over the judiciary. By accepting Salvini today, Kaczynski will show that his international image no longer concerns him."
" Salvini attacks Brussels, worse than the Duce There is someone who would like to establish a new regime or rather, in Brussels there is much worse than Mussolini, they do not have castor oil but they have spreads and finance and they do worse than fascism. So the leader of the League Matteo Salvini, at the microphones of Radio Padania, continues in his anti-Europe campaign. In Brussels - he continued - they are more dangerous than a few years ago, they are starving people as no fascist twenty years managed to do.However Salvini, who is also an MEP, was not in Brussels at the meeting with the President of the Republic Mattarella, but was visiting the Regional Council of Lombardy. No controversy, said the Carroccio secretary when asked about it: Unfortunately I missed it, I have a lot of commitments here in Milan, but I have already asked for a meeting with Mattarella in the coming weeks."
" Salvini caused a stir by blocking a refugee aid ship from entering Italy. In the past, the FPÖ called NGOs trafficking taxis. The Lega and FPÖ are equally critical of the EU border protection organisation Frontex, which also rescues refugees in distress at sea. For Strache, Frontex is a trafficking organisation."
" Salvini fears contamination of the European population. The meeting on Wednesday, which was attended by Strache and Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ), was about recipes against immigration.Lega and FPÖ, whose parties sit together in a Eurosceptic EU parliamentary group, agree on the basic idea, Harald Vilimsky confirmed in advance to the press. The FPÖ Secretary General travelled with them to Rome."
" Salvini had specified on landings and security, the League will not retreat an inch. Even conflict of interest and justice are in the field, they add from the Movement that on the future government contract will ask the online vote to the members.Mattarella grooms the sovereignists: from them proposals seductive but unfeasible, EU and euro are irreversible. The message loud and clear to Lega and Movimento5stelle came from the president of the republic in the speech delivered in Badia Fiesolana at the opening of the conference The State of the Union 2018. The president recalled that the united Europe will remain our point of reference, a mistake to want nineteenth-century anti-EU formulas."
" Salvini is allied with Marine Le Pen, hoping that the survey numbers will translate into votes. Even the sovereignists want to unhinge the historic EU structures, but in a very different way than the M5S. Without forgetting the Regionals in Piedmont, with the League that wants to finish the Tav. © RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" Salvini is working on a sovereignist front for the Europeans.D. But such a front does not exist, in the clash between Italy and the EU Commission the first to say no to the claims of the Italian government were the friends of the League, Hungary and Austria. It's not like they can allow their constituents to pay for the greater favor given to Salvini and Di Maio."
" Salvini, as he has now proved on the international stage, is a master of staging and provocation. The fan of Putin and Trump skilfully addresses fears when he draws gloomy scenarios for the future and warns of migration, Islam, bureaucracy, the EU, the euro or the bankers' conspiracy - entirely in line with his comrades-in-arms from the AfD, FPÖ or Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National. Salvini relies on rhetorical shock effects to attract attention: he promises controlled ethnic cleansing or propagates racist slogans via Twitter: ""You can save them if they are in distress at sea."
" Salvini, as he has now proved on the international stage, is a master of staging and provocation. The fan of Putin and Trump skilfully addresses the fears of his voters when he draws gloomy future scenarios and warns of migration, Islam, bureaucracy, the EU, the euro or the bankers' conspiracy - entirely in line with his like-minded comrades from the AfD, the FPÖ or Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National.Salvini loves rhetorical shock effects."
" Salvini, when he refuses disembarkations of migrants rescued at sea in the nearest safe port. The same goes for the European Parliament, where La France insoumise (LFI) and Rassemblement national (RN) MEPs sometimes unite in a sterile refusal front. This is the case for the revision of the posted workers regime, one of the greatest advances in the social field in recent years, for which the action of the President of the Republic has been decisive."
" Sampo Terho will enter the race as the favourite of the current leadership. During the presidential campaign, he has bounced around and made angry statements on issues such as immigration and the EU referendum. However, the pressure from the frontrunner is reflected in a stiff performance.Halla-aho, on the other hand, has tried to keep a low profile. For example, he said, it would not be worth holding a referendum on EU membership now, because there is no support for it."
" Sassoli's opposing candidates did surprisingly well in the election of the red president, such as the Green parliamentary group leader Ska Keller (119 votes) and the Czech conservative from the EKR, Jan Zahradil (160). As the non-attached (including British EU-sceptics) as well as the right-wing faction of Le Pen, Lega and FPÖ (ID) reject the new EU leadership, it will be difficult for von der Leyen: she needs an absolute majority of all MPs, 376 votes out of 751 more than Sassoli on Wednesday. No wonder the German travelled to Strasbourg on the very first day after her nomination to campaign for approval."
" Scattered across Europe, parties with little love for European integration are seeking to connect with each other. In just over six months, in May, are European elections, and by pulling together they can get a foot in the door in Brussels. ''The PVV is preparing with other parties in European countries for an electoral landslide,'' Wilders said. According to the polls now, 30 percent of the seats in the European Parliament go to Eurosceptic politicians."
" Secondly, PiS has a clear and popular position in it - it presents itself as a defender of Polish dignity and sovereignty. Thirdly, the dispute over Poland's independence from the EU allows PiS to push aside problematic issues from recent weeks, on which the party has been losing in terms of image and polls. These include."
" Secondly, because the demand for a referendum in Catalonia will continue to be a key factor for the agreement, whether now or later. And, thirdly, because Podemos' economic program is not only unrealistic and utopian, but also violates the budgetary principles established by the EU and, therefore, its application would result in a new crisis, as the tragic experience of Syriza in Greece has shown.But, equally, the dialogue with Ciudadanos is a necessary condition, but not sufficient for the investiture of Sánchez. Rivera's party has warned on numerous occasions that in no case will it go hand in hand with Podemos or the independentistas to support the PSOE."
" Secondly, the performance of the FDP, AfD, Pirates, NPD and the federal association of independent voters should also be a measure of their future significance in politics. The AfD's success means that, in addition to party leader Bernd Lucke and vice-chairman Hans-Olaf Henkel, Berlin conservative Beatrix von Storch, Baden-Wuerttemberg state spokesman Bernd Kölmel, renowned economist Joachim Starbatty, civil engineer Ulrike Trebesius from Schleswig-Holstein and, in all likelihood, lawyer Marcus Pretzell from North Rhine-Westphalia are also in the new EU Parliament.AfD leader Lucke saw his party's success as a ""lesson for the traditional political forces. His party had blossomed in the European elections and was well on the way to becoming a ""new people's party in Germany""."
" Secret meeting in Berlin In its search for alliance partners in the EU Parliament, the Euro-critical Alternative for Germany (AfD) has taken a step forward. Party leader Bernd Lucke was able to persuade Martin Callanan, a member of the British Conservatives and head of the Eurosceptic ECR parliamentary group, to attend a secret meeting in Berlin."
" Several PD MEPs also voted against. Outright opposition has come from leftists, greens, and Euroskeptics, which include M5S and Lega Nord. Negotiations between the EU and Canada on Ceta began in 2014 and were concluded last October. The agreement leads to elimination of duties and restrictions on a wide list of products."
" Seville, Zaragoza, Segovia, Valladolid, Barcelona, Lleida, Castellón de la Plana, Valencia, Mérida, Lugo, Pontevedra, Santiago de Compostela and, soon, Madrid join the 146 municipalities that have officially declared themselves TTIP-free zones. Up to 270 environmental, trade union and political organizations are working to stop the signing of the controversial agreement that will turn the US and the EU into the quintessence of world trade Lola Sánchez, a Podemos MEP, explains that the fact that politicians in Spain do not talk about the macro-agreement - either to defend it, like Chancellor Angela Merkel, or to criticize it, as did the former Austrian president, the Social Democrat Werner Faymann - makes it difficult for citizens themselves to engage in dialogue. Much more campaigning needs to be done in rural areas."
 Shares in Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank lost 1.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. A Jamaica coalition and the strong performance of the AfD could complicate the European integration sought by Germany and France and also the Brexit negotiations. Both would tend to be burdensome for the banks.
" She believes that a single European court would be better placed to deal with cases. You have a background in the Danish People's Party, which is sceptical about parts of the EU.Have you also changed your mind on that subject? I have always been very critical of supranationalism."
" She even threw him out of the party for that. The four MEPs from the FPÖ or the four from Geert Wilders' Islamophobic Freedom Party from the Netherlands play second fiddle in the ENF. The FPÖ is even considered to be relatively moderate what the intention of this right-wing special purpose group is was demonstrated by Le Pen, Vilimsky and Co in a press conference last week."
" She is an entrepreneur and maintains good connections with the Federation of Austrian Industries: The fact that Barbara Kappel has a relaxed attitude towards an EU policy that benefits business is understandable on the basis of her curriculum vitae alone. This is why she has long been secretly accused of having sympathies for the trade agreement between the EU and the USA (TTIP), which is demonised by the FPÖ. Only recently, Kappel warned in the European Parliament that the EU economy could fall behind globally."
" She is even listed as Lithuanian: I hope it is not something you have done to meet the conditions that you have to be a certain number of nationalities to get the money from the EU, she told Ekstra Bladet and reported Messerschmidt to the police for identity theft. Something that doesn't add up, was the headline of Søs Marie Seerup, known for her good political nose: There is a certain poetic irony in the fact that Messerschmidt and the DF, who have made a living out of thundering against EU cheating, frenzy and bureaucracy, are hopelessly stuck in that very cobweb.And this time they cannot - as before - brush off dust and cobwebs with a prejudiced narrative of being persecuted innocents subjected to discrimination."
" She needs the mandates of either the Danish People's Party or Enhedslisten, but is unlikely to get them. EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen (DF) wants a referendum on principle... I have nothing against the EU Patent Court.-- but this is a transfer of sovereignty, and I simply cannot understand why people are so afraid to ask the Danes."
 She said: 'The Taoiseach is well aware of Sinn Féin's opposition to sectarianism and discrimination in all its forms. 'He is also well aware of our position on Brexit and that we believe the future of all of Ireland is within the EU.' She added: 'The attempts to exclude Sinn Féin and to dismiss our mandate lack any credibility and are an insult to the hundreds of thousands of Sinn Féin voters across this island.' 'Many colleagues share my view'
" She sees a post-nationalist trend in the world: nations and states are increasingly aligning themselves with norms that transcend borders. According to Soysal, this is especially true of the European Union, the world's most developed system of supranational regulation. Why is the PVV frustrated with the Rutte administration's failure to restrict immigration? Because this is not so easy within the EU.At the same time, Soysal sees another, neoliberal trend."
" She sees the abolition of unanimity in foreign policy matters as a major reform project that Ursula von der Leyen should tackle immediately. FPÖ EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky, on the other hand, announced that he would vote against the Commission. The FPÖ considers one commissioner per EU member state to be too many."
" She was clearly in favour of a Dexit, i.e. Germany's exit from the European monetary union - not even Lucke wanted to go that far. Even in her rejection of the centralist EU, Weidel has remained true to herself in four years of AfD. The same goes for their abhorrence of Islam and their contempt for poorly educated refugees."
" Shortly before actually joining the EU in 1993, the FPÖ leader turned his party towards opposition to the EU and warned of negative consequences for Austria in a televised debate with Schildlausjoghurt: first Axel. Now FPÖ Secretary General and MEP Harald Vilimsky claims that his party never made an EU exit an issue - as if he could retrospectively correct his own involvement in the Öxit course. In reality, the Freedom Party jumped its second EU axe just before the 2016 presidential election."
" Should disadvantages for the UK quickly become evident, this could be to Van der Bellen's advantage. FPÖ candidate Hofer meanwhile reiterated his will for an EU exit referendum. Britain has proved that the EU - this EU - is manifestly far from the people. A change in the EU treaties towards a further reduction of member states' competences would automatically lead to a referendum in Austria, Hofer said in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera."
" Should we expect disruptive fire from the FPÖ? According to Paul Schmidt, Secretary General of the Austrian Society for European Policy, the FPÖ is likely to keep a low profile and adopt a moderate position on European policy. However, this could change again before the EU elections in May 2019. In the EU Parliament, the Freedom Party continues to sit in the anti-EU group ENF, together with the Lega and the Rassemblement National."
" Show's that we're all waiting for the HC, the bandleader asks the crowd to chant. Terror of opinion. Then we hear what the Free Party sympathisers expected: a sweeping attack on the federal government, the EU, foreigners and left-wing anti-democrats demonstrating against FPÖ events. A group of around 200 demonstrators gathered in front of the Salzburg Arena under massive police presence."
" Significantly surpass the 20 per cent mark and achieve maximisation of red-white-red content. These are the goals of Harald Vilimsky, who is the FPÖ's top candidate in the EU elections, as he emphasised in a press chat on Friday. He is not afraid that voters might leave after the Andreas Mölzer case: he has apologised."
" Silvio Berlusconi is back on the field, repeating trends, decisions, propaganda, methods, watchwords, as experienced by five lustri.In short, a government that in many respects has no precedent, starting from the political composition, a shocking election result, such as that of the last policies, forms of communication, primacy, activity, political elaboration that have little in common with the previous ones, even of the second republic: large parties, such as the PD and FI, and its leaders react as if nothing had changed. Instead, the latest policies and the subsequent change in relations with the EU indicate that parties should change, and how. M5s and Lega have disrupted political communication. It would be enough to think of Matteo Salvini's gimmicks, from changing uniforms, to divulging the food eaten, up to the diffusion of intimate moments by the (ex) cohabitant: it is a revolutionized language (productively, one would say).People, for now, seem to wait for irreversible slips, especially in the economy, to change their orientation."
" Similar to the year 2000, he could imagine an EU preamble to avoid disputes from the outset. For Karas, in any case, it is clear that there must be a clear rejection of the Öxit, Austria's exit from the EU, which the FPÖ demanded a year ago, as well as of gimmicks such as flirting with an exit from the euro. Karas accuses the SPÖ of irresponsibility, of having withdrawn. SPÖ delegation leader Evelyn Regner pointed to memory lapses on the part of the FPÖ."
" Simple FPÖ message gets through Styria. For the SPÖ, criticism of the EU and fear of cheap foreign labour are the reasons for the FPÖ's success. There is also internal headwind against the red-black reform course before the 2015 elections."
" Since 1995, it has received one billion euros in funding. Nevertheless, the SPÖ and FPÖ want to restrict the labour market for EU foreigners.Eisenstadt."
" Since the formation of the Turkish-Blue government in December 2017, this question has been haunting domestic politics. Kurz and Karas, the coolly pragmatic pro-European chancellor who governs with EU sceptics, and the orthodox EU preacher difficult.FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache fuelled this view on ZiB 2 on Wednesday when he said that an EU Commissioner Karas would be something difficult to imagine . But it's a shame that the EPP's top candidate Manfred Weber, who wants to be the next head of the EU Commission and would help decide that, is a good friend of Kurz. And from Karas."
" Since we are still at the battle between Guelphs and Ghibellines, on the choice between supporting or opposing the empire. Lega and Five Star? The Guelphs are the Five Star, according to whom an assisted Brexit for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies could fit. The League is a little Guelph and a little Ghibelline, because it cannot support the exit from Europe without risking losing votes among the Venetian entrepreneurs, very attentive to their business."
" Sinn Féin and the EU A chara, - Lynn Boylan (May 13th) takes issue with Stephen Collins's characterisation of Sinn Féin as an anti-European party (Opinion & Analysis, May 9th). Here the duck test is useful - if something looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck."
" Sinn Féin cannot say that, he added. Mr Durkan also referred to the use of clips of European Parliament speeches by Sinn Féin leader and former MEP Mary Lou McDonald by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.Its YouTube page features a montage including a variety of contributions made by Ms McDonald in 2008 when the Lisbon Treaty was being debated ahead of the first referendum, when it was rejected by Irish voters."
" Sinn Féin looks like an anti-European party because it has allied with the Danish People's Movement Against the EU and the fiercely anti-EU French Communist Party in the European Parliament. Sinn Féin talks like an anti-European party when it blames national failings on Brussels elites and repeatedly spreads disinformation about the non-existent EU army (as its MEPs have done during this very election campaign), tactics straight out of the Ukip playbook.Most importantly, Sinn Féin acts like an anti-European party. It has called for a No vote in every single European referendum we have held, even opposing our joining Europe in the first place."
" Sinn Féin looks, acts, and talks like an anti-European party. Sinn Féin looks like an anti-European party because it has allied with the Danish People's Movement Against the EU and the fiercely anti-EU French Communist Party in the European Parliament.

" Sinn Féin rampant THESE EU referendums just keep on giving. Sinn Féin, it appears, has every reason to be grateful for the torturous EU treaty ratification process whose polarising debates have set the Irish political establishment Fine Gael, Labour, and Fianna Fáil again at odds with the national mood, remorselessly feeding the irresistible advance of Sinn Féin."
" So Pitella tried to court approval in his group until the last moment. Unlike the Greens, the Left Group and also most of the non-attached EU-sceptics from the right-wing parties (including four FPÖ MPs), who reject TTIP in principle, the Social Democrats presented themselves divided on several occasions. Only Christian Democrats (EPP), Liberals (ALDE) and Conservatives (ECR) wanted to vote clearly in favour of the Lange Report."
" So Turquoise-Blue will try to work off some of the self-imposed to-do list. Above all, that which makes it as easy as possible for the electorate to show affection in the EU elections. It is therefore not without reason that both the former Vice-Chancellor and FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) presented themselves full of energy during his Enough is Enough speech. Strache said: Yes, there is still a lot to do."
" So as to ensure that there are no delays, a monthly formal report on Brexit activity should be published. Third, we must insist the unique position of Ireland is recognised by the EU in Sinn Féin's posturing on a unification referendum has involved no attempt to reach beyond the party's base and is merely our most anti-EU party cynically trying to promote itself. When there is a possibility of passing such a referendum, let us hold it, but for now we can't waste time that should be spent on protecting the interests of Ireland, north and south, in these negotiations."
" So far, he had only considered such a measure as a last resort in case of undesirable developments. The FPÖ is clearly different from the Front National, which is more critical of the EU.The Press: What about the Öxit now? Norbert Hofer: I am not in favour of Austria leaving the EU."
" So from what we've heard today, the showdown over reservations must be very far in the future, says Nikolaj Willumsen. Both he and the bourgeois EU sceptics in the Liberal Alliance and the Danish People's Party are calling on the government to now start a more fundamental debate on Denmark's role in the EU. I want Denmark to copy the British process."
" So it is in the hours following the Genoa tragedy: the company Autostrade per l'Italia is the first to be led to the gallows, then, Europe's turn comes. To lash out against Brussels is the Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini: If external constraints prevent us from spending to have safe roads and schools, then it is necessary to really question these rules, thunders the leader of the League. The numbers released by the EU, however, tell a different story. From 2014 to 2020, Brussels has allocated Italy 2.5 billion euros for roads and trains and 12 billion euros of so-called structural funds to help the poorest regions. Not only that."
" So it was right that Henryk Broder, who today plays a role similar to that of Walden, criticised the AfD's anti-Americanism and Putin-loyalty in his speech to the AfD parliamentary group, just as he criticised Alexander Gauland's birdshit speech. Indeed, our policies embody the opposite of what the AfD stands for. And at a time when the new nationalism threatens not only the cohesion of the EU, but the transatlantic alliance and its values, they are more relevant than ever. The centre must politicise itself again."
 So the parties that want to cut foreign aid owe us answers to what they actually imagine Denmark and the international community should do to get to the root of these problems. The Danish People's Party has succeeded in linking the debate on foreigners to the EU and making the EU the villain Because it is quite clear that some of these things cannot be solved by the individual Member States.0
" So they spoke the language, and then the language began to speak them. And not so much polexit as a political goal, but a post-polexit situation may happen to them - Secondly, the PiS president would like a divorce from the EU, but knows that most Poles do not. In the September survey, as many as 88 percent."
" So worrying about Crimea being invaded by the Russians makes no sense, because the real enemies are in Beijing, Tehran and Ankara and they are attacking us in the Sea of China, the Gulf and the Mediterranean. Hence the conclusion that Russia's ties with Lega and Cinquestelle are in our interests unlike those who continue to plot with Brussels and the ECB to impoverish the middle class more and more. The intent of Bannon's revolution is to strengthen citizens and thus their nations by weakening the superstructures that harass and tax them like the EU and ECB."
" Solidarna Polska politicians continued to call for a veto, as did Law and Justice (PiS) MEPs Jacek Saryusz-Wolski and Witold Waszczykowski, who declared that the compromise in this form meant the end of Poland's sovereignty. For this, President Andrzej Duda announced during his visit to Prague: - There is an outline of the agreement, which still has to be accepted by other EU countries.What is written in the EU regulation on the mechanism that so seduces PiS and Fidesz?This document was already in 2018."
 Some commentators saw this as the specter of post-Brexit. Kantar also asked respondents whether the policies of the PiS government could lead to Poland's exit from the EU. This view is shared by 49 percent.
" Sometimes you may have to resort to unpopular protective measures. The FPÖ has sharply criticised the EU's Turkey deal, among other things because it considers President Erdogan to be a tyrant. How is this different from Russia's"
" Sorry, we live in Europe. Even if this has not yet spread to the FPÖ, Van der Bellen counters and criticises the FPÖ's proximity to the AfD or Front National. Anyone who has friends like Marine Le Pen or rejects the EU would not be given a mandate to form a government, Van der Bellen affirms. The only point on which he would not continue the traditional interpretation of the presidency in the Second Republic."
" Spain must be rid of all nationalists, and the EU is a vaccine against them. Q.- Does Vox seem to you as dangerous for Europe as Salvini or Le Pen? A.- Vox, when it grows up, will become as dangerous for Europe and Spain as Le Pen for France, the Brexit supporters for Great Britain, Salvini for Italy or Podemos for Spain. I do not see in Iglesias or in Tsipras [leader of Syriza in Greece] anything better than in Vox.P.- The poll published yesterday by EL MUNDO predicts a notable fall for the PP in the European elections, from 26.1% to 16.8%."
" Specifically, only 26 per cent of Britons have a positive attitude towards the European Union, while 32 per cent are decidedly against it. Austrian niche In Sweden, on the other hand, the right advocates European integration in the hope of more deregulation, while the left fears for their welfare state.The fact that our German neighbours, for example, have considerably more convinced Europeans at 54 per cent than here at 37 per cent is attributed by Guido Tiemann, among others, to the lack of a continuous EU-sceptical mobilisation: ""Neither a left-wing nor a right-wing party can offer German EU opponents as reliable a home as the BZÖ and the FPÖ offer Austrian ones. This is also reinforced by the support of certain mass media."
" Spiced with real demands: With an end to group taxation - i.e. with the principle that profits and losses can be offset with foreign subsidiaries in a group of companies - a tax privilege would fall. In its diffuse proposals on how to deal with the financial crisis, the FPÖ admittedly remains what it has always been: national and anti-EU. There is talk of leaving the euro - a red-white-red lifeboat - and of breaking with Brussels."
" Standard: What is close to your heart in EU policy?Mölzer: In recent years, the FPÖ has justifiably pursued a course critical of the EU. This one is also a concern for me."
" Starting in April, Wilders enthusiastically tweeted about his visits to Front National frontwoman Marine Le Pen, Filip Dewinter of Vlaams Belang and Austrian FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache. 'Anti-EU coalition comes ever closer,' Wilders reports in August. Most PVV MPs learn via Twitter that Marine Le Pen will visit the Binnenhof next Wednesday at the invitation of Wilders. About the intentions of her coming to The Hague, Le Pen spoke out last month in the Flemish daily De Morgen."
" State notary with a fuse Done does not want to accept FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache as Federal Chancellor and would not anoint the declared EU opponent, the other threatens to dismiss the federal government if it does not act according to his wishes, for example, on the refugee issue, but also on tax policy. The statements made by Alexander Van der Bellen and Norbert Hofer in the election campaign were strong."
" Strache accuses the government in Vienna of EU-obedience Andreas Mölzer warns against burning all bridges to Russia Vienna. In the Crimea crisis, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache has criticised the unconditional EU-obedience of the SPÖ and ÖVP. The behaviour of the federal government is not compatible with perpetual neutrality, Strache declared."
" Strache acted as the more aggressive challenger, and the topics set by ORF were no disadvantage: immigration and the EU - these are the areas in which the FPÖ leader is at home. Spindelegger defended himself vigorously at times: Stop making people insecure, he said to the warning that EU foreigners would cause high unemployment. That was the old FPÖ line, he said."
" Strache wants Austria to join Visegrád group The group of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia opposes refugee quotas in the EU Vienna/Bratislava. FPÖ leader Heinz Christian Strache has spoken out in favour of Austria joining the Visegrád group, which advocates stricter refugee policies in the EU. The Visegrád states include Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia."
" Strache warns against the development of Islamic parallel societies in Europe. Such biotopes must be dried up, said the FPÖ leader. Strache sees social peace in Europe at risk, the EU is behaving like a globalised gang of robbers, people are being stripped to the bone. Strache accused the federal government of cowering on the European issue."
" Strache: Red line for Austria in EU Neutrality and sovereigntymust remain in place Vienna. In a press chat, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache also drew a red line with regard to Austria's EU membership after his statement that the UK would probably be in a better position after Brexit than before. Giving up sovereignty and neutrality is out of the question for us."
" Stronach wants to go back to the national currency (nothing else would be the Austrian euro), FPÖ leader Strache also wants steps towards exiting the euro. And even the FPÖ's election promise to cut Austria's contribution to the EU budget would not work without a radically different course in European policy (and even then it would be almost impossible to implement). Thus, Black-Blue-Stronach is doomed to failure on the European issuec-because at least the FPÖ and ÖVP cannot afford to give up their positions."
" Such a reach into the box of pure populism was and is unworthy of a Federal Chancellor even in the finale of an election campaign. It is also not true when opponents of the ÖVP leader pretend that he has mutated into an anti-European overnight in the ignoble competition with his EU-sceptical government partner, the FPÖ. The SPÖ election strategists, for example, but also the Greens, feast on the version according to which the old ÖVP of an Alois Mock would no longer exist as the European party."
" TD calls for reform of EU fund to support workers A Sinn Féin TD has called for reform of a European fund designed to support workers who lose their jobs as a consequence of globalisation after it emerged a significant sum may be sent back to Brussels later this year having gone unspent in Ireland. Dublin Mid-West TD Eoin Ó Broin said documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that millions of euro in such supports, provided through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, had already been returned to the European Commission."
" Taking critics seriously It was interesting to see the vehemence with which the pro-European representatives tried to talk down the only politician critical of the EU, the representative of the FPÖ, in the ORF discussion. The fact that the right-wing has gained ground in many European countries is a cause of concern for them, was their unanimous statement."
" Thanks to this shortcut, which all voters use to a greater or lesser extent, we can make sense of the political discussion. For example, it is likely that none of the readers (maybe some motivated) have read in detail the fundamentals of the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the United States. However, if IU or Podemos criticize it, or associations or journalists with leftist pedigree do the same, then it is likely that a voter who considers himself as such will also take a stand against it. He has not needed to read TTIP to evaluate it; because he trusts the judgment of those he believes represent his interests, he will be prone to adjust his views to align with them."
" That claim is perhaps the most dangerous of all right now for David Cameron's Yes campaign, because it could pull the many doubters towards a No vote. The Danish People's Party's assessment therefore holds so far that Johnson, Gove and others in the official 'Vote Leave' campaign are indeed holding a door open for a deal with the EU after a No vote.But there are so many unknowns in the DF's analysis of the aftermath, both internally in Britain and in relation to the rest of Europe, that it is risky at best.It's hard to predict what Johnson, Gove or other conservative skeptics will actually do after a popular no vote."
 That is the line I have taken during my time on the European Affairs Committee. She adds that there are also substantial reasons why the DF is against the court.DF is pursuing an agenda that is first and foremost about pushing the EU sceptic Lene Espersen.A new court designed to make patent applications smoother is being set up between 25 EU countries.
 That is very interesting in view of the video. Karas had already rejected cooperation with the FPÖ at European level immediately after the formation of the government in 2017.Karas says no to the FPÖ Interview.
 That is very interesting in view of the video. Karas had already rejected cooperation with the FPÖ at European level immediately after the formation of the government in 2017.Karas: FPÖ no longer a partner for EU policy Interview.
" That is what is at stake in the upcoming European elections. This time the stakes are higher than in the past because never before have Europhobes, Eurosceptics, populists and extremists gained so much ground: the Northern League in Italy, Alternative for Germany, the National Front in France, Jobbik in Hungary, Golden Dawn in Greece, UKIP in the United Kingdom, New Democrats in Sweden... And the latest assault has been carried out by Vox with its entry into the Andalusian Parliament.Political forces that, waving the flags of fear, hatred of foreigners and My Country First, want to break into the institutions like a Trojan horse."
" That is why he deploys a very forceful discourse against nationalism in all its versions. Question: Is the EU itself at stake in these elections? Answer: Yes, from these elections will come out a Europeanist majority or a blocking anti-Europeanist minority.Q.- Salvini, Orbán, Trump, Erdogan, Putin, Le Pen, Farage, Abascal... Are we facing the barbarian invasions of our era? A.- The barbarians were inside, in the end, and they still are. Globalization is challenging representative democracy."
" That is why the EU is something we must hold on to if we want to shape the world with European values, says Hedegaard, but stresses that the EU should not be given carte blanche to do everything. Since December last year, when Denmark voted no to amending the legal reservation (one of four reservations in the national compromise of 1992), several - including EU-positive parties at Christiansborg - have been talking about listening to people's EU scepticism and that there should be less EU in a number of areas. So Connie Hedegaard's view is dividing the waters at Christiansborg.In the Danish People's Party, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Bernth rejects the fear of nationalism and believes that Hedegaard is ignoring the people's desire for less EU: She can point out that if the EU does not soon manage to limit its desire for power, it will roll backwards. The population is so fed up with the EU's way of doing things that many are now willing to go backwards just to get out of it."
" That may be very accurate. Do you also think, like the Danish People's Party, that there is a need for a so-called welfare reservation? We would rather ensure that the EU is not a social union. Therefore, we also hope that Denmark will support the UK in the negotiations that will take place between the UK and the EU, so that we can ensure that the EU will be about the free movement of labour, but not the free movement of transfer incomes."
" That narrow section remains rabidly enthusiastic about referendums. The PVV, for example, would like to use the tool more often, especially when it comes to the EU. And the organizers behind the Ukraine referendum are entering the election in no less than three guises with this as their spearhead."
" That site is the most recent example of a whole series. With the euro crisis, negotiations on the European budget and the refusal to let Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen free travel zone, you see the same mechanism: it is Geert Wilders' PVV that, diplomats in Brussels say, dictates policy and draws the borders. The Dutch government is not distancing itself from Wilders in those areas either."
" That the foreign minister should be able to air his dissatisfaction with the EU in Berlingske without being asked what is wrong is embarrassing. And when did the press really go for the DF's 'EU scepticism'? They freewheel and rarely have to answer questions about their own co-responsibility for the policies pursued or about alternatives to the EU. And how could the Greens get away with misinformation about the EU's judicial cooperation and airy claims that international problems can be solved 'intergovernmentally'? ONLY SOON are top politicians reminded that all decisions in the EU are taken by elected representatives, so it is of course they who must account for failed or absent decisions."
" That there is a strategic will to put a form of wall perhaps between Russia and the European Union,"" Le Pen said. I know, having been an MEP, that the European Union, that the EU is waging a real cold war with Russia,"" the FN leader added.According to Ms. Le Pen, France's interest is to continue to have relations with Russia and even to deepen them."
 That would send the wrong message. The PVV opposes any expansion of the European Union. Turkey 81.6 million inhabitants Talks with Turkey about joining the Union have now been going on for some twelve years.
" That's actually incredibly unfortunate, and at the same time, the developments provided a unique glimpse into the state of affairs in the PVV offices in the House. A pity, because the program of the PVV is more than worthy of critical attention. Wilders proposes quite a lot. He wants the Netherlands to leave the European Union and sells this as an opportunity to become the boss again, without any possible negative consequences.It would be quite something if one of the six founding members of the original European Economic Community left the alliance of now 27 member states."
" That's not the kind of thing you want people to think. And there is no reason to talk about a Danish referendum in connection with the British Morten Løkkegaard Should Denmark just be a tailgater to Britain, no matter what the British do? The British government has said very clearly that this is a vote on whether to stay in the EU or leave. It would be disastrous for Denmark to follow that path Jeppe Kofod First the DF promised the Danes, without any backing, that we could get a special agreement on Europol without further ado.Now they continue the daydreaming by pretending that the British can just get a middle deal."
" That's the Left's problem. On top of that, the Danish People's Party has its knees bent.When it comes to EU cooperation, I don't think voters are fundamentally sceptical about cooperation with Sweden, Finland, Germany and the rest of Europe.--On the contrary, they know that our welfare and jobs stand or fall with this cooperation, and that our recovery is largely due to the government's doing away with the foolishness that the Left and the Danish Liberals were up to with border fences and other symbols that were supposed to move Denmark away from the core of EU cooperation."
" That's the problem, says De Hond. A clear course is lacking. The same goes for the EU position, where the SP stands out pale between the Nexit plea of PVV and FvD and the pragmatic pro-Europakoers of the centrist parties.The SP has fairly well-defined positions and a fairly steady base of voters - the 10 to 15 seats indeed, says Eric Smaling, former Upper and Lower House member, now list leader for Provincial Council North Holland."
" That's the way it is in a democracy, the government is not always right. The PiS government is apparently counting on the fact that now a discussion will begin in the EU about the sovereignty of member states and the dictatorial tendencies of the European Commission. - This discussion is already underway."
" That's what I think with the European Commission and I would like the government of Marine Le Pen and the Dutch PVV want a referendum on the EU.,,I find that very risky."
" That's why we want the UK to be a strong ally in reforming it, says Morten Messerschmidt, adding, In my view, you can't say you're going to leave the EU without also having a clear position on what to put in its place. In many parts of Europe, opposition to the EU is growing, strengthening parties like the Danish People's Party, but it can also be so victorious that it creates problems. For years, the Social Democrats' and the Liberals' EU positions have been more positive than their voters'."
" That, taken together, they add up to a European total. A first signal was the meeting of exponents of the Front National, the AfD, the Lega and Wilders' Party for Freedom in Koblenz in January 2017, the city that has been home to a monument to German unity at the Deutsches Eck since 1888. Whereas the populists had previously only been concerned with their national concerns and had at best found common ground in their anti-EU stance, they are now beginning to loosen their national self-encapsulation."
" The 1963 treaty was designed to prepare for Turkey's accession to the Union, and gives Turkish citizens rights normally reserved for Union citizens. During the cabinet formation in 2010, CDA, VVD and PVV agreed that the cabinet would make efforts to amend the Association Treaty between the EU and Turkey in such a way that residents of Turkey would be subject to the obligation to integrate. But last year, the courts ruled that Turks cannot be subjected to the obligation to integrate."
" The 300-strong protest came amid a political crisis at Stormont that has left the region without a devolved government as the Brexit process formally started. They chanted no borders, no barriers, no Brexit as they made their way up the landmark main avenue to the steps of Parliament Buildings.While Sinn Féin and the SDLP joined the colourful picket, elsewhere unionists welcomed the triggering of Article 50. The majority of voters in Northern Ireland backed Remain, 56pc.The Stormont march was organised by campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit."
" The 8-year-old EU ruling was blamed for a bit of everything as the media carried political commentary on the fatal accident in Copenhagen. Politiken.dk was also ready to lay it on the line: Ban on water scooters swept aside to appease free movement of goods, read a headline later that day from Copenhagen's mayor for culture and leisure, Carl Christian Ebbesen (DF).After these EU blunders, the Union's defenders took up the case. The think-tank Europa concluded on 10 May, after a tour through the law of the case: 'The water scooter accident should not be made an EU case'."
" The AFD, the German far-right party, which is said to be bringing in some 15 members, is being assiduously courted by the RN leadership to attract them to their group. The 5 Star Movement and its expected 22 elected members will join the ranks of the other sovereignist and nationalist party EFDD (Europe of freedom and direct democracy), where in recent years the British Brexiters of UKIP and defectors from the Front National have also taken their seats.It is above all the third Eurosceptic party, the least Europhobic of the three, that will suffer the most from the Brexit."
" The AfD demands an orderly end to the euro experiment. If the Bundestag does not pass this, the AfD demands a referendum on Germany's remaining in the euro. The AfD categorically rejects Turkey's EU membership. This should be a non-negotiable content of any coalition agreement for the AfD."
" The AfD is missing. Among the reasons, apart from the AfD's unclear future, is the fact that, unlike those other right-wing parties, it does not call in its election manifesto for the retention of an (albeit completely changed) EU, but for Germany's exit.This Dexit demand was the trigger for Lars Patrick Berg's AfD exit, and it increases the willingness of many others to take the same step. But that would lead them into a political representation gap."
" The AfD, the German anti-migrant party, would increase from 7 to 11. On the other hand, the 5-Star Movement, which sits with the sovereignists in the EFDD group (17 seats in 2014) and the National Rally (24 seats) are expected to see their results stabilise compared to five years ago. Is a broad nationalist alliance on the right possible?Populist and Eurosceptic parties are today divided into three different groups: Europe of Nations and Liberties (ENL) which brings together Marine Le Pen's RN and Matteo Salvini's League, ELDD (Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy) where Luigi Di Maio's M5S and the UK's Ukip are included. Finally, the European Conservatives and Reformists group includes the British Tories and the ultra-conservative Polish Pis."
" The Aliens Police Act already provides for detention pending deportation, including an asylum fast-track procedure. Nor can it be the fault of the EU, which the FPÖ usually likes to blame for all kinds of ills.The EU Reception Directive of 2013 explicitly mentions these measures in case of danger to national security and public order."
" The Austrian parliamentary election came at the end of an extremely charged European election year, characterised by two motives: the strong but diffuse desire for change and the constant confrontation with nationalists and radicals. Whether it is Marine Le Pen in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, the FPÖ in Austria or the AfD in Germany, the issue has always been - and still is - how to oppose those who question the foundations of the previous order, the liberal society.-- Sebastian Kurz and Emmanuel Macron have given radically different answers to this question."
" The Austrian position continues to be in line with the EU position. The annexation of Crimea was illegal under international law, which is why it is not recognised and a corresponding EU sanctions regime is in place. The FPÖ has repeatedly criticised the sanctions against Russia in the past. (sefe, APA)"
" The Austrian scandal spoils the party in Milan SOUVERAINISTS Matteo Salvini gathered his European allies, including Marine Le Pen's RN, in his stronghold yesterday. The leader of the Italian League, Matteo Salvini, gathered the nationalist camp in his stronghold of Milan (north) a week before the European elections, a grand mass tainted by a scandal affecting his Austrian ally.The first blip before the start of the sovereignists' rally, Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), resigned from his post as vice-chancellor yesterday after being accused of attempted collusion with the pseudo-niece of a Russian oligarch."
" The Brexit decision has given the European question a whole new topicality. Being against the EU and foreigners has been the FPÖ's core programme for decades.In the press on Saturday, Norbert Hofer cancelled the Öxit."
" The Brussels elite is partly responsible for moving crime to the Netherlands.' Zijlstra further called for the abolition of the European Parliament. The statement approved by the parliament on Thursday states that the PVV website is contrary to all the fundamental values of the EU: freedom, equality, and respect for human rights. She accuses the PVV of being out for political gain on the backs of Eastern European workers."
" The CPB thinks otherwise: the Brexit will hurt the Dutch economy considerably, the Planning Bureau judged in June. In its positive assessment in 2012, the CPB had not included exit from the EU.The plans of the PVV have two major revenues: the de-Islamization of the Netherlands would yield 7.2 billion; the cancellation of all kinds of subsidies 10 billion. This is not explained in any detail."
" The Coalition lost in three votes on its approach to Brexit. It lost the votes on a Private Members' motion submitted by Sinn Féin, which called for the Government to negotiate for the North to retain a special status within the EU when Britain leaves the bloc.The Sinn Féin motion also called for quarterly reports to the Dáil by the Government on Brexit negotiations and for all of Ireland to remain within the EU after Brexit.During a Dáil debate on Wednesday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan had warned against Ireland seeking special status because it would risk undermining the Government's efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island after Brexit."
" The DF's rise comes mainly at the expense of the Left, which is facing hard work to stop the voter exodus. The spectacular advance of the Danish People's Party is a signal that although support for the EU is strong among the majority of Danes, it does not come of its own accord - and work must be done to maintain it. The DF has conducted an election campaign with an appealing, but meaningless message: less EU, more Denmark."
" The DUP has an active sceptical wing overlapping with Ukip but its leaders are pragmatically alert to the dangers involved. The UUP will probably swing towards staying in the EU, the SDLP and Alliance more decidedly so.Sinn Féin is expected to adopt a critically favourable approach, advocating a different type of Europe from within not without. Official Ireland needs a Northern Yes vote to bargain either way."
" The Danish People's Party and Kristian Thulesen Dahl are aware of the V-government's position, but were unable to comment yesterday. Leninist Party spokesperson Pernille Skipper agrees with DF that the referendum on the legal reservation has undermined Denmark's EU policy so far. According to the party, the circle of Japanese must stop talking politics with each other in closed rooms, because they do not have the support of the people."
" The Danish People's Party is criticised for breaking promises, and the party's defence is pointed. DF's Morten Messerschmidt thought he could give the Danes a guarantee of continued membership of Europol after a no vote. Party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl wrote that we can secure membership with a new referendum next spring."
" The Danish government must now choose whether Denmark is on the team that tries to stop the drive and calm the situation, or whether we want to extend the tour with new issues that arise in connection with the British exit: for what about voting weights that are now changing? What about countries outside the euro losing their ace mate? What about the deal on welfare benefits now in the bin - can it be fished out and dusted off, as several Danish politicians want? Denmark should not naively negotiate in favour of the British, said the Prime Minister, while the leader of the Danish People's Party concluded that Denmark's task must be to help the UK get as good a deal as possible - so that we Danes can later vote on a British model. POLITICS MEANS Denmark must work for a fatter EU.DF said no to the last British model - the opt-in system in the field of justice. Round and round it goes."
" The Dutch, French, Belgian and Austrian Socialists were still close to this option, although party sources maintained that they expected some of them to give in. In seeking this support, the candidate for Commission President is trying to avoid having to rely on the Eurosceptic conservatives of the ECS (which includes Polish MEPs from Law and Justice (PiS) or Spanish MEPs from Vox) or Identity and Democracy (the group led by Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen).. However, even that support seemed unclear, especially after Poland's ultra-conservative PiS was caught in the cordon sanitaire - which in principle was not supposed to affect them - and deprived last week of the chairmanship of a parliamentary committee."
" The EBU against our nations"". Marine Le Pen did not mince words on 1 May, reverting to the brutal Europhobic rhetoric that her party had successfully employed during the 2005 referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty. The most amusing thing is that this Europe, which, according to the leader of the Rassemblement National, was created by agents in the service of American ""financial political interests"", is being denounced in the same terms by the Trump administration. Moreover, Le Pen is advised by Steve Bannon, the architect of the American president's victory..."
" The ECDC joint monitoring alert system may have failed due to the ignorance of the warned, and the proliferation of different tests makes it difficult to collect actual infection figures. The paralysis of the community in the most serious crisis of the continent since the Second World War naturally immediately calls the EU opponents to the scene. In Austria, it is above all FPÖ functionaries who are now posting that we must now look to ourselves above all. That was to be expected."
" The EU Parliament had bowed to pressure from ultra-conservative and reactionary politicians when it voted instead for an amendment by the European People's Party (EPP). It states that sexual and reproductive health is a matter for the individual EU member states. The FPÖ had also voted against the Estrela text. According to the rejected report, abortion on demand is legal in 20 EU countries."
" The EU and greed-driven elites Sir, - An EU official states that the Sinn Féin Bill to stop banks selling impaired loans to vulture funds could damage our economy, while a UN report criticises the Government for facilitating the sale of so much property to those very funds. How can the EU ever command respect from ordinary people if it continues to champion greed-driven elites?"
" The EU has already seen the new executive at work on the issue of immigration and has touched with his own hands to what extent he has been able to go (leaving at sea for days a ship full of people fleeing from the Libyan hell). And so, while on the one hand there are the promises and reassurances of Tria, on the other there are the threats of the 5 Star Movement and especially the League, which are preparing to open the second front of confrontation with Brussels. Convinced to capitalize on the results at the next European elections in May 2019.But the margins of negotiation are narrow."
" The EU has become unreformable and is gradually degenerating into a planned economy. It was almost irritating that the AfD speakers did not call for an exit from the EU when, in their opinion, it can no longer be reformed and threatens the free-market system.Sahra Wagenknecht was the only (and, as always, passionate) speaker to show solidarity with Kevin Kühnert's positions, which were once taken for granted by social democrats."
" The EU is also not a state, but we always do things together, and then it is clear that we all have to stand together for co-responsibility in the whole. The SPÖ's European mandatary Eugen Freund said there were other people in Europe who were much more representative of the new political right in the EU. Freund was concerned about the function of Harald Vilimsky, head of the FPÖ delegation in the EU Parliament, in the right-wing populist group Europe of Nations and Freedom, whose chairperson is the FrenchwomanVilmsky stressed that his party was not interested in destroying Europe, but in developing it further."
" The EU needs a comprehensive democratisation process immediately. This doesn't sound like the FPÖ is about to start an exit campaign. No, we need a Europe of the people, not of the EU bureaucrats. The EU now has to understand this wake-up call."
 The EU sceptics who want to go to Brussels FPÖ. The Freedom Party has fixed its candidates for the EU elections - and its focus in the election campaign has also been determined.
" The EU superstate must disappear from the map, Annemans said. National sovereignty and blocking any greater European integration constitute the aggregating basis of the five anti-EU movements. But there is no shortage of internal divisions. Salvini has glossed over the separatist line of the League, compared to the homeland value promoted by the Front National, or the past membership of Farage's group. He explained that the priority of the five parties is to address the emergency constituted by unemployment, illegal immigration, Islamic fundamentalism and the damage produced by the euro."
" The EU was created for food production, but European agricultural policy has now been taken over by nature and climate fanatics. The reactions of British farmers after the Brexit are telling: the EU gave more burdens than joys. Also the FvD plea for burden reduction appeals to him and, like FvD, he is in favor of referendums. That he is announcing support for FvD while the CDA is running a difficult campaign, right in the province of former party leader Sybrand Buma..."
" The European Commission has taken the first steps towards possible sanctions against Poland. Søren Espersen cannot say whether the Danish Parliament supports EU sanctions.He doesn't follow that part closely, he explains."
" The European Union would say no because in past years we have already exploited all possible margins of flexibility. But defying Brussels, for a Lega-M5S government more than an obstacle would be a temptation..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" The European project must be saved before it is irreparably ""broken"". The changes in Europe and the world in the space of forty years make the coming elections the most important since 1979. Populist parties cannot win and have a majority in Europe, but the Rassemblement National can come first in France. A terrible symbol for our country and beyond for the European cause and the values it embodies.Even if the democratic side wins this round, nothing will be decided yet."
" The FN points to the ""spectacular failure"" of the EU ""Euroscepticism will inevitably lead to a political shock that will shake the entire traditional political class."" This prediction of Eurosceptic deflagration is signed After theSi"
" The FN's objective is to continue the work begun with the municipal elections and to prepare the very important deadlines for the Department and the Region. In this vast and very rural area, the FN plans to distribute a document presenting its vision of Europe. We are European, but against the European Union whose centralised organisation has led to a dead end. Treaties, especially the Transatlantic Treaty, must be renegotiated for the benefit of sovereign nations."
 The FPÖ has the best relations with her and congratulated her on the 13 per cent in the elections. There's no need for sanctions or anything: anyone who forms a government with this FPÖ has no business in the EU.The FPÖ is an anti-EU party. Item.
" The FPÖ is an EU-sceptical party, as it was under Jörg Haider, who in 1994 said Njet to the Union with the Maastricht Treaty, specifically: the Euro, open borders, common foreign trade, common security, etc. Strache's FPÖ is not coincidentally in the right-wing group with Le Pen's Front National in the EU Parliament. Your Europe has little or nothing to do with this EU."
" The FPÖ is not pro-European Turquoise-blue government is possible, but in matters of the EU there is confusion of terms Ztwo governments formed by ÖVP and FPÖ in 2000 and today, but what a difference in mood and public assessment of the suitability of such a coalition, also in terms of its role in European policy! When the pact between ÖVP Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schüssel and FPÖ leader Jörg Haider became apparent 17 years ago, all hell broke loose in the media, the public and the parties. In Vienna, thousands took to the streets."
" The FPÖ is now increasing the pressure on the red-black federal government for a new regulation, saying that this export of family allowances must be stopped. FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl complained on Friday that the balance in the EU was exclusively at the expense of Austrians. The country of origin principle should be applied to the payment, the amount of family allowance should be based on the cost of living for the child in the respective home country."
" The FPÖ leadership has somewhat credibly shed the anti-Semitism and Nazi trivialisation that were still common with Jörg Haider. In the lower ranks of functionaries, however, there are always individual cases of right-wing extremism or neo-Nazism. The FPÖ toyed with leaving the EU until it realised that this was not popular. So."
" The FPÖ politicians could not be reached by the press by telephone or electronically by the editorial deadline. Even with their clear position in favour of abolishing sanctions, the FPÖ representatives are at odds with the official Austrian line. So far, Vienna has supported the EU policy - albeit partly grudgingly. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz advocated a gradual abolition of the punitive measures should Russia behave constructively in the Ukraine crisis."
" The FPÖ sits in the parliamentary group next to Le Pen, a representative who repeatedly campaigns in France with the argument that she wants to get out of the euro. She wants to get out of the Schengen area, i.e. raise the borders again, and she wanted to leave the EU. That is the programme of Le Pen. They are sitting at the table with them. That's why the FPÖ must reflect on where it belongs.European policy, the FPÖ is not a partner?"
" The FPÖ stands for voting out the irresponsible, completely twisted policy of inviting refugees. The coming EU election will be a reckoning with those responsible for the refugee crisis. Those who want the consistent course of the Austrian government at the EU level must vote for the FPÖ, said Strache. Vilimsky reports good contacts with the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, which still belongs to the European People's Party, and with the Polish ruling party PiS."
" The Federal Chancellor, on the other hand, does not know what to do with this verbal accolade, he quietly makes it seem all the stronger by dismissing the author as unsatisfactory. The enthusiastic praise for Chancellor and Foreign Minister by Bavaria's former Minister President Edmund Stoiber, donated for the demand to break off Turkish accession negotiations with the EU, must be seen by the FPÖ as reducing its chances in the election campaign.Abut Hofer can also score abroad."
" The Forum for Democracy leader assumes that voters want to get rid of the failing national government, full of lies and self-hatred. He promises a stricter asylum policy, a farewell to climate madness and a Nexit from the dictatorial European Union. The message seems to be catching on. FvD membership is growing, the polls are favorable, and the campaign meetings with member of parliament Theo Hiddema are proving to be crowd pullers. The main illustration for the success is the nervousness in the VVD."
" The Freedom Party currently wants the right of asylum to be suspended, temporarily no more applications should be possible, and migrants should instead be sent back to safe third countries from which they come, i.e. illegal pushbacks should be carried out. And even though it has often been said in the past that the Turks are trying to overtake the FPÖ on the right, especially in asylum policy, they cannot keep up with these demands that are contrary to EU law. This does not mean that the ÖVP is not considering a tough approach to the increased number of asylum applications."
 The Freedom Party has fixed its candidates for the EU elections - and its focus in the election campaign has also been determined. The ballot is delicate but important: it is the first nationwide election after the FPÖ entered government. Vienna. EU elections are among the more delicate ballots for the FPÖ. Not because the Freedom Party supporters would deviate from the party line.
" The Freedom Party wants to massively lower the hurdles for referendums, which the ÖVP is not entirely comfortable with (see report on page 1). The situation is similar with compulsory membership in the chambers: The FPÖ is in favour of abolition, the ÖVP rather against it.The EU chapter is also tricky because of external perception: Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen has emphasised several times that he will only announce a pro-European government. Both parties are in favour of EU reforms, towards a subsidiary Europe."
" The Freedom Party will be sidelined internationally if it only associates itself with the Le Pens, Wilders and other questionable personalities. And if the FPÖ does not change its fundamentally anti-EU stance, it will be very difficult for it to participate in a government.Standard:"
" The French Parti Socialiste suddenly wants to get rid of the new euro pact with its strict budget rules, just like the PvdA in the Netherlands. For the political middle is by no means immune to the new anti-EU sentiment. Under the influence of the PVV, the VVD is turning away from Brussels, as the SP is doing with the PvdA. And Sarkozy's anti-EU rhetoric is his response to Le Pen's electorally successfully exploited EU hatred."
" The French authorities are doing well. Marine Le Pen talks about restoring the death penalty, the League wants to block Schengen. And you? We must defend European principles, freedom of the press, the values of democracy and coexistence, free movement, certainty and adequacy of punishment."
" The French daily Le Monde emphasised that it is important to keep in mind for whom or for whom not. what almost every second voter voted for: an FPÖ that is surfing along on the wave of rejection of refugees and the whole construction of the EU .--From the point of view of the European partners, the focus of interest was not on domestic policy decisions in Vienna, but on the possible direct consequences for the Union or, respectively, the EU. individual member countries."
" The Frenchman should first do his homework, he should be more concrete, it was then said. With the often EU-sceptical FDP and the anti-EU AfD in the opposition, the CDU and CSU were afraid of making too many concessions to their neighbour, which in this country is already tainted by a lack of willingness to reform.#NAME?"

With the often EU-sceptical FDP and the anti-EU AfD in the opposition, the CDU and CSU were afraid of making too many concessions to their neighbour, which in this country is already tainted by a lack of willingness to reform.Merkel's offer should not cause great horror in the Union."
" The Frenchman, one of the leaders most attached to the deepening of the European construction, lost Sunday's flagship duel against the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Rally, with 22.41% against 23.31% for the RN, according to final results, a 0.9 point difference. The RN immediately called for the ""constitution of a powerful group"" in the European Parliament bringing together the Eurosceptic formations, heterogeneous forces that have not managed to federate in the past. After the UK's exit from the EU, both lists will get the same number (23) of MEPs."
" The Greens also see neutrality as an obstacle. The ÖVP wants a common European defence policy with an EU army - while maintaining neutrality. Last week, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache also called for an EU army that would break away from Nato. He also wants this while maintaining neutrality."
" The House of Representatives is concerned that the Netherlands may soon lose hundreds of millions of euros to Brussels for overdue expenses. Yesterday the CDA, PVV and SP immediately asked Rutte for clarification, the PVV in very clear terms. Are they in Brussels `absolutely out of their minds', Geert Wilders wanted to know from Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem. ,,Surely you do not intend to co-pay 10 billion euros for Cyprus one week and 11 billion euros for Brussels' profligate bureaucrats the next.''"
" The IMF perceives us to be contagious, while the threat of recession is amplified, a genre of bad consumption that loves to feed on excessive debt. In Brussels, they fear that the League and the Christian Democrats will be caught by short-sightedness and use the clash with Brussels as a theoretical generator of consensus, for the Europeans, and possibly for the policies. In short, they are afraid that the opposite of what President Mattarella hopes for, who asks us to put the common good at the center of our action, will be realized. A common good based on development and protection of savings, but which disappears if we continue to go into debt like bad family men."

 The Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini shows that things can be changed quickly. Immigration and the end of the federalist model of the European Union are the two campaign themes favoured by the RN. Philippe Olivier brushed aside his future competitors.
" The Italian debt level was set at the end of 2017 at 132% and Spain's at 100%. Molina stresses another difference: Spain is still in transit from the two-party model of the PP and PSOE to a multiparty system that is not established and in which, moreover, all parties share a very similar vision of the European Union, even Podemos, which only has 18% of the votes and is not anti-European. The League and the 5-Star Movement, which are, in the March elections, combined for 50% of the votes."
" The Japanese TV station NHK has also asked the EU rapporteur whether the powerful eurosceptics in Denmark could push for a Danish exit and thus contribute to a potential domino effect. Even though Kenneth Kristensen Berth is not a member of the party leadership, the post of EU spokesman gives him a central position when it comes to defining the party's line on the big issue, which is at the same time a huge opportunity and an enormous uncertainty for the Danish People's Party.Majority of DF voters want out of EU Several in the party admit off the cuff that there has been scattered fencing and some doubt about position on the issue of future EU membership, which along with the issue of immigration has been the overriding theme for the Danish People's Party since its founding in 1995. In February, MEP Morten Messerschmidt declared that for the first time ever he could recommend a yes to the EU, and as recently as March he wrote that it must be in the Danish interest to appeal to the British to stay. But the strategy of recommending or merely hoping for a yes vote proved, according to one DF source, downright dangerous for the party, whose voters are largely not just sceptical of the EU, but opposed to it."
" The Japanese will see to that. Jens Loft Rasmussen, Danneskiold-Samsøes Allé 42, Copenhagen: The Danish People's Party apparently believes that we should have no faith in the EU or the majority of parties in Parliament, who have committed themselves to the fact that if the vote is in favour of an opt-in system, no agreements will be made on asylum without a new referendum.It looks bad for representative democracy if we cannot leave it to the majority of the Folketing to decide on other legal matters."
" The Justice Ministry is flirting with the idea of not applying the verdicts of the Court of Justice. And the Foreign Ministry is barring its diplomats from taking part in the latest recruitment for the EU's External Action Service. Theoretically, the Law and Justice party remains pro-European when Poland's and Poles' membership in the European Union is supported by 88 percent. researched."
" The Kremlin is accused of launching this anti-EU propaganda after the annexation of Crimea and the crisis in Ukraine, which also generated European sanctions against Putin's magic circle. The National Front of France's Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini's Northern League, Beppe Grillo's M5S along with the British separatists of Nigel Farage's Ukip, which EPP and S&D consider among the parties most in tune with the Kremlin's line, voted against. The National Front, which obtained loans from a Russian bank for its political activity, called the resolution European lying propaganda."
" The Kremlin leader goes to Vienna for the 50th anniversary of the bilateral agreement on gas supplies: the first of its kind between the Soviets and a Western European country.The rapprochementVienna therefore aims to maintain what its conservative chancellor Kurz has called traditionally good contacts with Moscow. But also Italy, for a long time among the most open countries towards Russia, could get closer to the Kremlin with its new yellow-green government, which has set among its objectives the cancellation of EU sanctions against Moscow. After all, Salvini's League, just like the Fpö, has also signed a cooperation agreement with United Russia. But the friends of Putin front does not end here."
" The League is not against Europe, we are Eurosceptic and Eurocritical because the Eurozone as defined no longer works. The secretary of the Northern League, Roberto Maroni, has launched yesterday the proposal of a referendum for the re-foundation of a democratic and federal European Union based on peoples and regions, and for the accession to the euro area limited to the territories that respect the balanced budget. But beware: Not us, but the Financial Times has established that in the Eurozone there are regions that are eligible to support the single currency and others, such as Southern Italy, that are not."

But beware: Not we, but the Financial Times has established that in the Eurozone there are regions that are eligible to support the single currency and others, such as Southern Italy, that are not."
" The League must succeed in transforming itself from an exclusively populist party, dedicated to fighting the European Union and immigration, into a conservative and eurorormist party. This means accepting the presence of the European institutions, even though it wants to radically change them. In other words, recognize the legitimacy of the EU, putting an end to the phase of complete aversion. Regarding the fight against immigration, the League, while remaining a law and order party, should probably reduce the constant hammering on landings and the securitarian obsession. Continuing to focus only on immigrants risks becoming counterproductive."
" The League's number two Giancarlo Giorgetti, fresh from his appointment as head of the Foreign Department, denied that the party wants Italy to leave Europe.R. But who wants me to believe Giorgetti, who is then, among other things, contradicted by Salvini a minute later! It is a cultural problem, the League means Giorgia Meloni, Marine Le Pen. They are all political forces that have been waging a battle for years and have gained a foothold in society with anti-European policies."
" The Left and Conservatives have already taken a more Eurosceptic line in the election campaign. Bendt Bendtsen has talked about looking after Denmark in the EU, and the Liberal Party's leading candidate Ulla Tørnæs will not lie down flat for the EU or be an EU dupe. With around a third of Danes voting for Eurosceptic parties such as the DF and the People's Movement Against the EU, it will be more plausible in future for the established Japanese to be critical of certain EU issues. F."
" The Left wants zero growth and the LA negative growth. In EU policy, the DF's strongly sceptical stance is not compatible with the traditional Japanese parties' positions - despite the change of course in EU policy by the Left and the Conservatives in particular. And recently, the Conservatives struck a climate deal that had the rest of the blue opposition shaking their heads."
 The M5S MEP Fabio Castaldo has judged shameful this interested and mystifying manipulation of reality because it is not Russia's fault if the trust in this Europe and in its incapable leaders has collapsed. The Ukip spoke of worrying reminiscences of the Cold War. For Lega Nord MEP Lorenzo Fontana Russia must be an important partner and not an enemy. Several members of the majority did not follow party discipline and abstained or voted against.
" The M5S may well claim to have entered into a compromise in its own likeness. On a crucial issue such as relations with Brussels, however, he appeared subordinate to the League.Probably, more than Euroscepticism weighs the absence of true convictions."
" The MH17 disaster placed Geert Wilders' party in an awkward position. Wilders had still done the Russians a favor in May by placing the blame for the Ukraine crisis primarily on the EU, which he had scorned, on the Kremlin station Russia Today. But at the end of July, PVV MP Raymond de Roon strongly criticized the abject Russian reaction to the crash. The Kremlin takes good care of ties with European right-wing populists, including hosting them in Moscow on a regular basis."
" The NV-A is a member of the European Free Alliance, which includes the Silesian Autonomy Movement perceived by the Law and Justice party as a hidden German option. Paradoxically, Brexit will increase the ideological cohesion of the ECR, but will clearly move it away from the EU mainstream. In Poland, PiS politicians preached Islamophobic slogans and portrayed European Muslims as a fifth column and a mortal threat. Meanwhile, at the end of the previous House term, more than 20 percent of"
" The NYT therefore adopts the thesis of Beppe Severgnini, who on Monday signed a comment in the newspaper in which he underlined the luck of the Italians: Thanks to their rational president, they have the possibility of reconsidering their answers to a very important question. By voting Lega and Cinque Stelle, they put Italy on a collision course with the EU. It was not a foregone conclusion, if you think that the Nobel Paul Krugman, the Nyt's leading paper, sees it this way: I do not like who won in Italy, but denying them the government to defend the euro sounds like the last breath of the European project."
" The National Front is back to its historical roots to remobilise voters Paris (AFP) - Like her father, Marine Le Pen has been stigmatising immigration to remobilise her troops, without saying how she is going to end the European Union which, in her eyes, is encouraging a migratory surge.It was in the name of change that the National Front became the National Rally (RN) in June. But according to political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, Ms. Le Pen's speech on Sunday in Fréjus (Var) was written by a megretist executive from the 1990s with immigration and identity at every level."

" The Northern League, in fact, has seen a significant increase in the polls, thanks to the provocative rhetoric that has brought more support. The League's position suggests a willingness to maintain an adversarial relationship with Brussels, which would affect the budget in the absence of short-term solutions. To claim that the situation of Italian bonds will improve is a gamble."
" The Orange Party in Carinthia, led by Uwe Scheuch, demonstrated this years ago and fraternised overnight with their former adversary Strache - primarily to improve their political chances on both sides. The joy of the SPÖ headquarters that Stronach's party would especially hurt the main opponent, the FPÖ, was probably premature. Criticism of the euro and billions for EU countries finds supporters not only among liberal sympathisers but also in the SPÖ club - as the example of Köfer shows. However, the importance of a backbencher in parliament as an election agent should not be overestimated."
" The PO leader referred to anti-EU statements made by important politicians of the United Right. - PiS and Kaczynski want to take Poland out of the EU. I know it, argued the PO leader."
" The PP hastened, from La Moncloa, to reinforce its electoral message that Spain needs stability in the face of the uncertainty that is opening up in Europe. PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos charged against populisms, alluding to Podemos. Pablo Iglesias' party, critical of the EU and supporter of the Catalan referendum, is hurt by the climate of unrest, which could dissuade voters on Sunday.The European Union entered fully into the Spanish election campaign in injury time, despite the fact that it had not been the focus of the political debate, and with potentially mixed results for the candidates."
" The PSOE confirmed that the sole vice-president will be Carmen Calvo, who will also be responsible for Equality, placing the policy in favor of women in the same Palace of La Moncloa, a gesture of complicity to women.In addition, Sanchez phoned mid-morning to the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to inform him of the appointment of his Minister of Economy, Nadia Calviño.The economic responsible of the Government was Director of Budgets of the Commission. The appointment of a liberal committed to Europe is a declaration of intent: Sánchez is committed to economic stability and strict compliance with the economic parameters set by the EU, contrary to what Podemos or other parties that supported the motion of censure are demanding.The economic priority of the Executive is to tackle from the outset any uncertainty in the markets, which did occur after the motion of censure, approved in the midst of the Italian crisis.Economic experts close to Sánchez point out that, although the economy is now doing better, Spain is not yet shielded against a possible new euro crisis.The president launched at the same time a powerful message to the autonomous communities for the pending financing. He announced the appointment of the Minister of Finance of the Junta de Andalucía, María Jesús Montero, as Minister of Finance.Montero has her own voice in the Andalusian PSOE and has not been proposed by Susana Díaz, according to Ferraz."
" The PVV also rejected the first text that referred to an EU definition. It was in fact the European Parliament that called for its adoption, and that is when all the alarm bells go off for the PVV. Through blind EU-hatred the PVV, which presents itself as a 'friend of Israel' and never misses an opportunity to condemn Islamic anti-Semitism, almost torpedoed the definition that is supposed to make it easier to fight anti-Semitism. The anti-EU frenzy preceded; the PVV only agreed to a modified text."
" The PVV goes from 4 to 0 and the SP from 2 to 0 seats. FvD comes in at 3 seats. So it's a halving of the total number of seats for EU skeptic parties. Voters apparently have had enough of parties with no constructive vision, who only oppose something without offering real solutions."
" The PVV is now represented with four members in the giant Europarliament (766 seats). The party can roar the anti-Europe narrative as loudly as it wants, in Brussels the PVV is a toothless tiger. And without cooperation with like-minded people, this will remain the case in the years to come."
" The PVV itself prefers to call them as little as possible. In Brussels, Dutch ministers are doing their best to avoid the image that they are being so difficult because the PVV wants them to be.The PVV point of view will certainly make it even more difficult for Prime Minister Rutte at next month's EU summit in Brussels. The problem the Netherlands is making with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen free travel zone is on the agenda."
" The PVV now operates independently in the Euro parliament and cannot claim anything. Wilders has put a lot of energy into the European project over the past year and promised his supporters that he would make short work of the monster from Brussels. He did not want to comment yesterday on where things went wrong. The PVV leader thought he had an ironclad ally in Marine le Pen, someone he believes will become the new president of France. Sure that her father Jean Marie did not make the task any easier."
" The PVV was branded unreliable and lost nine seats in the election. No party in The Hague likes to do business with the PVV at the moment. The Euro parliament is an attractive alternative to the Binnenhof. The anti-EU sentiment in the Netherlands is quite strong. For the PVV, success is shining in the European parliamentary elections, next May."
" The PVV, together with the Front National (FN) and a number of other parties, has still managed to form a Eurosceptic group in the European Parliament (EP). Party leaders Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen announced this morning at a press conference in Brussels. The PVV and the FN failed to gather enough allies to form a political group after the European elections last summer. Since then, however, the parties in the EP have been working with the Austrian FPÖ, Vlaams Belang and the Italian Lega Nord."
" The PiS election program makes it clear: it is the Polish Constitutional Court that is to have the final say in matters of European law, which is incompatible with the EU treaties. PiS also rejects Poland's membership in the eurozone. According to the Law and Justice party, For us, the European Union is above all an association of states. We stand for a Europe of homelands."
" The PiS government does not respect the rulings of the EU Court of Justice, this government further violates the rule of law. It is clear that by leading to a complete marginalization of Poland in the EU, he is preparing the ground to be able to convince Poles that membership in the EU does not pay off for them. PiS politicians stopped hiding this fact.Polexit is no longer a political fiction."
" The Planning Bureau says: do you close the borders? Then it will cost you ten billion euros. Well that's ridiculous, totally idiotic!, growls PVV MP Martin Bosma. The same story is presented to you when you want to leave the euro or the EU. But look at the Brexit: the British economy is now going through the roof! Moreover, he believes that far too much value is placed on all those numbers and tables."
" The Radicals recovered from the bad election result four years ago and regained their mandate. --The People's Movement against the EU improved its result slightly and will continue to have a seat in the Parliament. Morten Messerschmidt (DF): with 465,758 personal votes, the winner of the election has broken all records - even Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (S), who received support from 407,966 Danes in the 2004 EP elections.Morten Messerschmidt is an EU sceptic, and in the new parliamentary term his biggest project will be to fight for the EU not to interfere in who the member states pay welfare benefits to."
" The Rassemblement National is reviewing its European policy from top to bottom. The failure of 2017, the difficulties in clearly explaining the exit from the euro, the fear that this proposal has aroused among pensioners, who have the most assets and who weigh heavily in the electorate, the inability of the party to attract graduates and voters with the highest incomes..."
" The Renzi government of 2014-2016 disappointed because, despite loudly announcing reforms, it accomplished too little. Ideas like the flat tax and the citizenship income are logical heirs of Renzi's poor results with the Jobs Act, help for start-ups and incentives for investments in advanced technology.Let me tell you from this citizen of a country like Great Britain that has chosen Brexit: the worst and most seductive path is Euroscepticism. Yes, both the Five Star and the League have toned down their positions on the euro. However, both continue to rely on this alleged potential to force Germany and the European Commission to loosen the constraints on Italian fiscal policy; probably not a successful strategy, but still not sensible for a country with a public debt exceeding 130% of GDP and a banking system that is still vulnerable."
" The SDLP and Sinn Féin are on side of remaining. The European Union is by no means perfect, and we are one of the most critical parties of the EU, but it's quite clear that it would have a devastating impact on the island, having one part of the island in the EU and one part out, says Daithí McKay, the Sinn Féin MLA for North Antrim. He cites agriculture and tourism, both of which are vital to the economy in his constituency, as sectors that would be badly hit by a Brexit."
" The SPÖ and ÖVP have comparatively little(er) to fear here. Stronach primarily targets the FPÖ/BZÖ electorate (party disgruntlement, anti-Euro, anti-EU) and those of the ÖVP; other economic liberal groups primarily target the ÖVP. All in all, this could well mean political death for the BZÖ, cost the weakening ÖVP valuable percentage points and put a brake on the FPÖ's high-flying performance of the previous year."
 The SPÖ and ÖVP have long been trying to have family allowances for children living in other EU countries based on the cost of living in the country concerned. A cessation of payments abroad is ruled out due to EU regulations. There is a motion for a resolution by the FPÖ in parliament; there is no unified line among the governing parties. S.
" The SPÖ and ÖVP prefer to leave this area to the Freedom Party (FPÖ), which advocates radical solutions. FPÖ social affairs spokesman Herbert Kickl demanded on Monday a sectoral closure of the Austrian labour market for non-EU citizens and EU citizens. To do this, one could also defy EU law, Kickl says. The FPÖ claims that Austrians are paying twice over: They are being squeezed out of the domestic labour market and also have to cross-finance the AMS and social benefits for foreigners.Instead of developing a strategy for the Austrian labour market, the SPÖ and ÖVP argue about how to solve the problem."
" The Secretary for Internal Participation was particularly offensive towards Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he warned that she will be more and more alone in Europe every day as her delegates are ousted from the national governments, as has happened in Greece and is sure to happen in Spain. Europe's problem is not Greece, it is Germany, concluded the Podemos leader, in a clear nod to the negotiating pulse with the EU that Syriza maintains. The political secretary of the organization, Íñigo Errejón, yesterday abounded in the idea of his colleague to confront the policies of attention to the citizen with those of cuts imposed from Berlin."

" The Secretary of State remains totally focused on her ongoing and determined efforts to build a brighter, more secure future for [the North]. To suggest otherwise is ludicrous.' In the North, Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party are all campaigning for the UK to remain within the EU. The Democratic Unionists are backing a Brexit, while the Ulster Unionists will delay nailing their colours to the mast on the issue until they have an internal debate on Mr Cameron's EU reform deal."
" The Social Democrats insist that Denmark should be able to go it alone and stop spontaneous asylum processing at the border. The new demand is part of the guarantee Østergaard has given voters, namely that he will not support a government that does not break away from the policies of the Danish People's Party: Unfortunately, I think I can see that the Social Democrats are pulling in the direction of the DF in this area. On this issue of the asylum freeze and going it alone in the EU, it is one to one what the DF wants. A full and complete asylum freeze, says Morten Østergaard."
" The Spanish elections will look to Greece, as the PP and Mariano Rajoy have begun to wield the discourse of fear about a possible arrival of Podemos to La Moncloa hand in hand with the PSOE. On the other hand, both Iglesias' party and the Syriza coalition insist that the harshness with which the EU is behaving with Tsipras is to cut off formations like Podemos in Spain, the fourth power of the euro. It is not those who call a referendum who destroy Europe, but financial authoritarianism, German arrogance and the inability of the rulers to defend their people, Iglesias proclaimed."
" The US makes no distinction between the political movement and its armed wing, both of which are affected by sanctions. In the 24 hours he spends in the Middle East, the League leader does not meet Abu Mazen, the Palestinian president: I hope to see him soon. The EU in these years has been unbalanced, condemning Israel every quarter of an hour..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" The Ukip first party in Britain is also an early response to the referendum promised by Cameron, assuming that the British Prime Minister does not personally dismember the EU by seeking sovereign allies among the other members. And in Italy, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that Grillo and the League, who are certainly anti-euro, together got a higher percentage than Marine Le Pen did in France.And yet we are only at the alarm bell, so much so that Parliament and the EU as a whole will remain perfectly governable."

" The VVD recently had to defend itself against the accusation that it is letting the Netherlands pay for the financial mismanagement of others - PVV leader Geert Wilders calls the recovery fund an incredibly idiotic plan. Thanks to the conflict with Poland and Hungary, and Rutte's role of booster in this, the prime minister can show that there is no blank check going to the EU.The quarrel also gives Rutte a stick to beat the PVV with. Wilders is a fan of the Euro-critic Orbán and of Hungary in general - his wife is Hungarian - and he openly sides with the Hungarian government in the conflict over EU billions."
" The Viennese Member of the National Council Petra Steger follows behind. The previous female EU representative of the FPÖ, the economic liberal Barbara Kappel, will no longer be in the European Parliament. Roman Haider, a member of the National Council from Upper Austria, is running in fourth place."
" The abolition of roaming charges or the 14-day right of withdrawal in online retailing are just two examples of many. Jörg Meuthen (57), leader of the Eurosceptic AfD, takes a completely different view: ""The EU has some good approaches, but it is completely overreaching. This over-bureaucratisation creates problems for citizens where there should be none. Meuthen cites the General Data Protection Regulation as an example."
" The ambassadors of the EU countries (a majority of 15 out of 28 EU countries) decided on Wednesday evening that this would be the first part However, these are actions that amount to political pressure, which, despite the calls of PiS critics in Poland and the rest of the EU, cannot stop changes to the Supreme Court.- The problem is that it is unclear whether the Court could stop these changes to the Polish Supreme Court."
" The attacks are producing a wave of demands destined to condition the agendas of the parties; to make them more attentive to the fears of public opinion. And, like Marine Le Pen's Front National in France, in Italy it is the League that leads the front of those who seek to take advantage of what has happened: for reasons that are both cultural and electoral. The demand to abolish the Schengen Treaty, which allows the free movement of European citizens in the Union, is only the first act."
" The backstop, which the supporters of Brexit do not want to accept, is currently the biggest hurdle on the way to an amicable agreement. Yesterday, Tuesday, another representative of a governing party of the EU-27 spoke out for more accommodation: Harald Vilimsky, Secretary General of the FPÖ and head of the Freedom Party delegation in the EU Parliament. Both sides must now approach each other and make compromises, Vilimsky said."
" The bad example is spreading, he proclaimed. It cannot be ruled out, after Brexit, that the nationalist retreat will spread in Spain faster than the coronavirus. Vox, on the one hand, and Puigdemont, on the other, encourage Europhobia in a country that thought it was vaccinated against populism. However, to dismiss the platforms of Empty Spain as if they were heirs of the 'procés' is frivolous."
" The ban on different compositions has been replaced by a ban on significant different compositions, a list of exceptions has been added and the onus has been shifted to the customer to prove that he has been misled into buying an inferior product. - The Law and Justice representatives in the EU Council did not oppose the watering down of the provisions, and then when this rotten directive came back to parliament, they voted in favor. None of them support the amendments I tabled to guarantee real protection for consumers, says Ms Thun."
" The bill of the PvdA, D66 and GroenLinks has been on the shelf for years. That it is now being dusted off is thanks to PVV leader Wilders. He wants to use the law to hold a referendum on the EU. The law is a handbrake, argues PvdA MP Heijnen."
" The bitter comments of the vice-premier and minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, reflect the mood not only of a party but of a failed project: that of sinking the old balances in the name of sovereignty. Looking at the US as an adversary of Europe means not so much reaffirming the alliance with the first world power, but using it as retaliation for the exclusion of the League and M5S from the strategic choices of the new EU. It is a problem, because it will be up to Salvini to propose a name to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, perhaps for Commissioner of Competition: portfolio of weight, if confirmed."
" The broadest statement in the archives, however, is that VdB would not nominate as chancellor or minister any politician, regardless of party, who did not have a clear pro-EU stance. If, for instance, there is a Black-Blue or even a Red-Blue, note the fact that the whole FPÖ is on the verge of a clear hostility towards the EU and has the best contacts with declared enemies of the EU such asAustria is definitely facing a turnaround, and the president will have to be careful that it is not too radical."
" The bulk of the leaders of the different parties once again demonstrated unity in the fight against this scourge. On the other hand, the statements made by the Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, who emphasized the criticism of the EU strategy in Iraq and Syria, conflicts that are fuel for the IS, were shocking and embarrassing. It is possible to disagree with the role of Brussels in the Middle East."

" The candidate does his best: talks to the sparse market visitors, tries to engage them in conversation. In the case of two boys and a girl, it succeeds: we must not put up with the EU's regulatory frenzy, says the FPÖ politician. 80 percent of the decisions would be made in Brussels, only 20 percent in Austria."
" The celebration comes at a time when the political relationship between the Netherlands and Turkey is under pressure. This is partly due to the rise of Geert Wilders' PVV and because the Netherlands has become more skeptical about Turkey's accession to the European Union. But at the same time, the trade relationship is flourishing, mainly due to the solid growth of the Turkish economy."
" The challenge is to show that the FN is the only real opposition to the policies of the government and Macron. Better than the agitation proposed by Mélenchon, Marine Le Pen is going to give a direction. Le Pen's European coming out ? In the meantime, it's time for a new direction, and the FN president is preparing to set a serious course this Thursday. On Europe in particular: the Frexit and the systematic rejection of the European Union, as promoted by Philippot - according to the party's new bosses - are out the window, and it is time for reflection and feedback from the presidential campaign."
" The chancellor is apparently already following in the footsteps of Viktor Klima, is already preparing himself for his election defeat in a fortnight and is already ordering new EU sanctions if the result does not go his way. Kickl rejected Kern's presentation that the FPÖ is blatantly anti-European. The FPÖ was critical of the EU and stood for a Europe of fatherlands."
" The chaos that has ensued in the United Kingdom only reinforces their belief that such an experiment should not be repeated here. Nevertheless, the future of the EU promises to be an important topic in the next parliamentary elections. While PVV and VNL advocate a referendum for a Nexit, the SP sees something in a plebiscite on an EU with fewer tasks and power. It is so far the only serious Hague alternative to a Nexit ó the option of keeping everything as it is."
 The choice of the non-voters EU election. Will Mölzer's stay and Martin's departure change the starting position? No. The FPÖ already had a problem. And HPM voters have already migrated.
" The choice, says the outgoing leader, is between a strong and free League that does not consider mandatory the alliance with Berlusconi and those who have nostalgia for the League of 3%. Salvini's project is well known: to leave the northern fence to aim at a national League that has at its center the battle against the EU. This idea is opposed by Fava (supported by Bossi), who has become the spokesperson for that part of the party that does not want to give up the theme of Northernism."
" The citizens are supposed to dutifully go to the European elections, but in the end the Parliament cannot even decide who it elects to head the Commission. SPIEGEL: But the frustration about the non-transparent EU is backfiring on you. A party like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) wouldn't even exist if people were satisfied with the EU.SPIEGEL: It sounds like you take the AfD very seriously."
" The coalition negotiations, however, would be continued with full force. Othmar Karas, head of the ÖVP delegation in the EU Parliament, is clearly critical: With their trip to Crimea, the two FPÖ politicians are disavowing the EU's foreign policy, he says to theSTANDARD"
" The company manufactures pistols with 30-round magazines, for example. From Brussels to Vienna, the Freedom Party opposed the EU regulation, for example FPÖ Secretary General Harald Vilimsky, who at a press conference described the Arms Directive as a trap that only brings disadvantages . Instead, Vilimsky called for fewer restrictions, also to stimulate the arms trade .Suddenly the ÖVP slows downThe intensive negotiations on the implementation of the EU law have been going on within the government since the summer."
" The conflict with the European Commission and the Council of Europe over the Constitutional Tribunal makes us perceived as an unpredictable country. Some politicians and the PiS base will welcome Brexit. They do not like the Union, considering it a culturally alien creation to real Poles."
" The countries of the Western Balkans are to be given a clear prospect of accession. Less EU is more from the point of view of the FPÖ: it does not want to levy its own EU taxes, does not want its own Union finance minister and does not want a social union. There is to be military cooperation, but no joint army."
 The critic and the querulous are now united The Alternative for Germany now belongs to the same group in the EU Parliament as the Tories around Brussels#NAME?
" The critic and the querulous are now united The Alternative for Germany now belongs to the same group in the EU Parliament as the Tories around BrusselsFederal Chancellor In the UK, the development has also been closely followed."
" The current mix of topics is primarily responsible for this. The FPÖ has been constant in its criticism of the EU and migration for years, which is why it is now benefiting from the Greek crisis and the flight to Europe. Their voters do not distinguish between immigration and asylum."
" The cynical game of polexit and emotion around the conflict with the EU is only good for Novgorod until it happens. Kaczynski must remember that Not surprisingly, it is the countryside and small towns that have felt the greatest change in the quality of life after Poland's accession to the EU. While waging war against the EU and cynically fueling the debate about post-lexit, PiS must remember that it is balancing on a tightrope over an abyss. Especially since there is now virtually no margin for error."
" The cynicism of Sinn Féin in the manner and timing of their intervention on this was a source of great frustration, he said. Speaking at the event in the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Mr O'Brien said Gerry Adams's party faces a particular challenge because it opposed EU membership in the first place.As we all now focus on how to mitigate the damage of Brexit, Sinn Féin needs to start getting its head around beginning to actually advocate for Europe.Not as a mechanism to get one over unionism or as a means to something else, but as a community of human rights, prosperity, security, and common interest that Northern Ireland is better being part of, he said."
" The debate on the end of expansionary spending policies will return. After the disasters in the euro crisis in the south of the EU, with Covid European policies must leave no one behind.Podemos urges the government of which it forms part to assume greater leadership in European policy, guaranteeing an expansive policy and not allowing a return to the fiscal rules that controlled deficits and debts that imposed so much damage on the countries of the south.From the PSOE they also celebrate the fact that the elections in Germany have corroborated the political cordon to the extreme right formations, which they took advantage of to criticize the PP. From here you could take note and, now that the PP is holding its convention, you could take the opportunity to put a cordon sanitaire to Vox and stop outsourcing their ideas and proposals, was Lastra's message to the populares.The PSOE celebrates but does not criticize."
 The decision to provide for expenditures that Italy could not afford seems to have been made. M5S and Lega talk about Renzi's fake quarrels with the EU; but only because they fear being challenged on the same Eurosceptic ground.The news is that the EU Commission this time appears determined not to negotiate.
" The degree of pessimism about Europe varies according to ideology. Podemos voters are highly skeptical about the usefulness of the EU in the crisis: 66% of their voters believe that, in times of difficulties, Spain has not been helped by being in the Union.Pages"
" The degree of pessimism about Europe varies according to ideology. Podemos voters express high levels of skepticism about the usefulness of the EU in the crisis: 66% of their voters believe that, in times of difficulties, Spain has not been helped by being in the EU. The most pro-European voters are those of the Popular Party, 90% of whom believe that the country continues to benefit significantly from its membership in the European club."
" The dilemma of the cake is countered by the theory of the cornucopia: debt is not a problem, money has no limits, as long as a sovereign state prints it, inflation is only a number and in any case no longer exists thanks to new technologies and Asian wages. So, let's spend as much in deficit as we want and if the EU forbids it, let's get out of the EU as Lega's economic manager Claudio Borghi has argued. It's a pity that not only the public economy, but also the private one, needs to be financed on the market: the big companies, starting with the state ones, or the banks, starting with the biggest ones, must issue debt securities and place them with the public, otherwise they can't stand."
" The distinction between the pragmatic wing and the radical wing is a thing of the past. And the fact that the Polish prime minister is meeting with Le Pen was clearly understood in Brussels or Paris - Warsaw considers the candidate in the French presidential election, who is openly anti-European and whom the EU leaders (except for Orbán) avoid like hell, a legitimate interlocutor and ally. And whom until some time ago PiS avoided like hell. Poland stands hand in hand with the extreme right."
" The divergence, however, is on the strategy and cultural coordinates of leadership groups and electorates that in recent years have drifted apart, and in part dispersed into abstention. Many in the Berlusconian movement do not recognize themselves in an alliance led by a League that insults the head of state, mocks Pope Francis on the subject of migrants, dismisses the EU, and strokes xenophobia. The miracle of understanding holds in the perspective of sharing power, not when the perspective is to preside over the opposition; because even on how to fight the left, ideas diverge."
" The document contemplates that this unit would act as an authentic judicial policy with functional (not organic) dependence so as to have control of the police investigations to be carried out in each criminal investigation or proceeding, as well as direct control of the personal and material resources applied. This unit, which would ultimately depend on the vice president, would monopolize competencies that now depend on the ministries of Finance and Interior.BACKWARDS FOR FOREIGN PRESENCEAmong the Podemos proposals there are some that contemplate greater internationalization, such as creating an EU Parliament, with others that would mean a step backwards in international commitments. It raises a very vague approach to the desire to achieve greater autonomy for Spain and Europe in NATO, as well as the rejection of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), but it also raises measures that are difficult to implement within the European structure."

" The drop in the polls and in the last local elections is attributed to Salvini's unscrupulousness and his alleged lack of respect for the contract. Thus, now the League has become dangerous. The back-and-forth game with France's Marine Le Pen and Hungary's Viktor Orbán are a threat to Italy and the EU.To think that up until a few months ago, when it was pointed out that sovereignism meant more austerity and no redistribution of migrants, the Five Stars reacted in almost the same tones as Salvini."
" The echo of the never of the former president who continues to act as the conscience of his party will resound tonight in the ears of Pedro Sánchez when Pablo Iglesias invites him to govern jointly, with the presidency and the greater weight of the new Executive to be distributed according to the votes and seats of each one.The red lines marked by González were very clear: The PSOE can never be a partner of Podemos, some irresponsible who practice a rupturist populism of pseudo-left. Díaz did not say as much, but she did not need to, she has spent the entire election campaign touring Andalusia with a speech that has spent more time criticizing Iglesias' party than commenting on Sánchez's proposals.It is noteworthy that the two Sevillians who will have in their hands the future of Spanish socialism after tonight's predicted disaster -it will be seen whether more or less severe- will compare Iglesias with Cameron and the anti-European attitude of Podemos with Brexit. The left-wing media are determined to present the latest polls, including those of these days that are disguised as flowers to circumvent the law, with graphs in which the possible results are divided into two blocks: the sum of PSOE and Podemos versus PP and Ciudadanos."

" The egg-blonde dyed Wilders was severely punished in the elections and will probably play a much smaller role in Dutch political life. Contrast this with the political situation in Austria, also a smaller country with considerable economic weight in Europe: the largest opposition party, the FPÖ, is pursuing a rabid anti-EU course that has even eclipsed its xenophobia. It is not much different with the small splinter group BZÖ."
" The euro is (still) popular The very high score of the Front National in the last European elections - 24.95% - obscures the view of the benefits that the French recognise in European construction. Because when asked, as in our Ipsos poll, whether they want to end the euro and return to the franc, 70% of them want to remain in the euro zone."
" The euro zone If the question of whether or not to leave the euro polarised the presidential campaign, to the point of destabilising the Front National, this is not the case for the European elections. No major list proposes to leave the single currency."
" The event is presented by the leaders of the Rassemblement National (ex-Front National) as the pivotal moment of the far right party's campaign for the European elections. Some have been talking about it for weeks: at the end of March, a joint meeting of European nationalist formations will be held in Milan (Italy)."
" The executive has taken a clear direction: that of the clash with the European Union, a little driven by ideological reasons, a little greedy by electoral calculations. The challenge in Brussels did not, however, have as its counterpart a commitment to growth. The League and Five Stars did not try to free themselves from European obligations, for example, to promote a Trumpian policy on taxes. It can be debated whether this is a possible operation, for a country that has a public debt equal to 132% of GDP and is growing at 4601 euros per second, but perhaps the reaction of the markets would have been different."
" The extra seats have already been distributed after the May European elections. The VVD, Forum for Democracy and the PVV are the lucky ones.VVD member Bart Groothuis is quietly waiting. The Brexit is such a monumental event in our history, it must be done in an orderly way, he believes. So if the British need more time, they should take it, he believes."
" The fact is that if we continue in this way, it will be very difficult to make ourselves heard in Brussels, starting with the examination of our public accounts, which have been postponed pending the new structure. Even economists who look favorably on the League argue that the exit from the euro (and in fact from the EU) would destroy the productive system. It would therefore be useful to start from the convinced affirmation that a united Europe is an important value that must be defended for its economic, peace and cultural implications."
" The fact that someone whose parents immigrated from Nigeria and the Philippines and who was born in Austria is now being held up as an example of successful integration because of his skin colour is another extreme. Men are the most enthusiastic about football, and they are the FPÖ's main target group. The Freedom Party, which is only in third place in polls six weeks before the EU election date, is fighting for every vote. They want to address EU opponents and voters who want to express their protest against the red-black government."
 The fact that this party advocates quite a few things that God has forbidden - Baudet does not refer to Christ's resurrection - is no objection to De Jong: It is much more exciting to operate in such an environment than to surround yourself with hundreds of like-minded people. That opens up a perspective for others who have had enough of like-minded people. You are a sustainability activist with solar panels? Join FvD and your life will regain excitement. You agree with Baudet that the EU is a scourge on all nation states? Seek rapprochement with an exciting environment.. Ask D66 to put you on the list for the European Parliament and be stimulated by Guy Verhofstadt there! View original page:
" The fallout over the Ceta free trade agreement was just as much a breach of trust as the content of the working time flexibilisation is threatening to become. As far as the fight against any possible movement of refugees into Austria is concerned, on which the FPÖ had lived so long and so well, Kurz has long since taken over the leadership of the issues here and outflanked the FPÖ. Apart from a very restrained rebellion against the EU, the FPÖ has hardly any issues left.Chancellor Kurz will have to think along liberal agendas in the future and be a little more generous in allocating topics."
" The favorable circumstance for Palazzo Chigi is to be able to present the rest of Europe with a very broad alliance. The breadth of the coalition allows the former president of the ECB to overshadow the most polemical accents towards the institutions of Brussels: those coming from the League, as well as the opposition of Fratelli d'Italia, for the delays and mistakes made on vaccines; and shared a bit 'by all, not only in Italy. Draghi has been explicit on this point."
" The fear is that the LD candidate will face a barrage in the hearing called to confirm him; and that he will emerge defeated and humiliated. But it also outlines the prospect that, if elected, the commissioner indicated by Salvini will become an integral part of the government of the EU, and therefore weaken the anti-European offensive of the League. Instead, the challenge is to come up with a name that foreshadows a tough daily confrontation with the other commissioners and the Brussels institutions."
" The fight against money laundering and tax evasion is an important political priority, but creating a transparent citizen for this purpose goes much too far, criticises CSU MEP Markus Ferber. His FPÖ colleague Harald Vilimsky called on the EU Commission to withdraw the tender for the feasibility study. The idea that the financial and asset situation of every citizen should be accessible to a central authority at the push of a button is more than strange. Neos MEP Claudia Gamon also rejects the idea: ""When I look at how many state institutions have had problems with cyber attacks and the protection of citizens' data, I would feel much better if the Commission commissioned feasibility studies on how to increase cyber security in the Union instead of collecting more sensitive data. The Vice-President of the European Parliament, ÖVP MEP Othmar Karas, on the other hand, does not see any need for action at the moment, as there are no concrete plans yet."
" The first group includes nationalist forces such as Jobbik in Hungary, Golden Dawn in Greece. Or euroskeptic movements such as Marine Le Pen's Front National, which received a 9 million euro loan from a Russian bank in 2014, and the Northern League. Yesterday, Leghist secretary Matteo Salvini flatly denied any possible financial ties with Moscow."
" The first is the consensus among NATO countries that Russian actors have exerted malign influence through the web in several recent elections in NATO countries - from the presidential elections in the US and France to the political elections in Germany and the referendum on Brexit in Great Britain - in order to favor outcomes capable of bringing internal turmoil and instability. The second is the link between the League and the party of United Russia, close to the Kremlin, evidenced by a written agreement.The third is the presence in the government contract between Five Stars and League of the request to end sanctions on Russia voted by the European Union - and supported by the United States - after the annexation of Crimea, in 2014, violating the sovereignty of Ukraine. The overlap between Russian interference in the electoral campaigns of NATO countries, formal ties between the League and Russian politicians, and the request to end sanctions makes several partner countries and allies fear that the Kremlin may see in a League-Cinquestelle government the opportunity to break the front of Western cohesion."
" The first negotiation opened by the Executive, with Podemos as a preferential partner, has become complicated in the last few days. Pablo Iglesias' party insists on setting as a condition that the Budgetary Stability Law be repealed, something which the Socialists flatly refuse to do because they understand that it would be tantamount to breaking with the Brussels guidelines and placing Spain in a very difficult situation within the EU. On the one hand, the Government is surprised by the hardness that Podemos has shown in the negotiations. On the other hand, Iglesias' party stresses its disappointment with the latest document sent to it by the Socialists, since it understands that they have hardly made their position more flexible."

" The first place where it can manifest itself is here, in Spain, tomorrow. The Brexit victory clearly favors Podemos because it shows that even in countries as serious as the United Kingdom it is possible for a rebellion against the system to prevail. And, if you think about it, our electoral campaign has had some similarities with that of the British referendum: slow but steady rise of populists and the Popular Party responding to their ideological arguments with almost technical speeches, basically economic and with no ideological depth."
" The five Podemos MEPs sent a letter to the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the Vice President, Frans Timmermans, to denounce that the Government had carried out a violation of the fundamental values of the European Union in Catalonia and that the conditions for the application of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union in Spain were fulfilled. This article aims to ensure that the common values of the EU, including the rule of law, are respected. Podemos claims to Juncker that Spain should be investigated because, in his opinion, the conditions for invoking the aforementioned article are fulfilled. Thus, the legal responses provided by Article 7 are being pursued."
" The focus would shift towards a common market rather than pan-European legislation and supranational values. Salvini wants to create an alliance that will make this possible. For PiS, which is not wanted by the European People's Party (EPP) faction, currently the largest in the European Parliament, this could be a unique opportunity. Either they play for everything with Salvini, exposing themselves to Brussels progressives, or they will remain on the margins of EU politics for years."
 The following table shows the number of employees. FPÖ MEP Harald Vilimsky also criticised that in the long term Austria would pay more into the EU reconstruction fund than it would get out itself. The money flows mainly to poorer EU countries that are more affected by the pandemic.
" The former Trump advisor responded without complexes, as is typical of the current authoritarian style, and his Europhobic responses were reminiscent of the Pablo Iglesias of the squares and streets, who returned on Saturday to his old ways: The decisions will be taken by the people in Spain and not by a bunch of bureaucrats in Brussels (...) We are witnessing a global revolution of ordinary people. He praised Orban, Le Pen, Salvini (whom he advises) and, of course, Vox, a national-populist party that he began advising in the summer of 2017, I was still in the White House. He does not hide his intention to storm the European Parliament and hopes that Abascal achieves 15% on 28-A and generates a shock wave in Europe."
" The former press spokesman of the Road Safety Board has not been much involved with EU issues so far. Most recently, he repeatedly called for restrictions on immigrants from EU countries and a general immigration stop. As an FPÖ MP, he advocated for more rights for the security forces. In doing so, he also defended the use of stun guns on judicial guards."
" The foundations of the EU, namely the rule of law, democracy, freedom, but also peace, security and stability. The foundations of the EU, namely the fundamental values of the rule of law, democracy, freedom, but also peace, security and stability, are a justified reason for a healthy self-confidence of the Union in dealing with its own problems and self-doubts as well as in the face of the intrusiveness of foreign actors. Such self-confidence, however, should never be accompanied by nationalism. Almost the opposite of what EU sceptics are constantly whining about. And of what Kurz's coalition partner, namely the FPÖ under Vice-Chancellor H.-C. Strache, along with their far-right partners in France, Italy, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere, constantly (and against all evidence) claims."
 The free movement of EU citizens is an essential part of the common treaties. FPÖ party leader Heinz-Christian Strache spoke out against any punitive measures by the EU.
" The fun only stops in this country when it comes to sport. Because a negro is a negro,"" says Gerhard Schmid, an MP, who finds nothing wrong with Mölzer's statements, even after his expulsion from the EU list. If the FPÖ had been better off in the polls shortly before the EU elections, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache would probably not have recalled Mölzer. The racist remarks about the pitch-black Alaba in Mölzer's Zur Zeit are at least"
" The goal is to change the balance, to become decisive in the new Europarliament more shifted to the right, and in the composition of the EU Commission. Only after the vote, Salvini will know his allies, also because in these months he has been able to support contradictory solutions. Yesterday, for example, Silvio Berlusconi proposed a new majority between the European Popular Party (EPP), the Ecr conservatives, where he would find Giorgia Meloni, plus Salvini and Marine Le Pen. An understanding welded in the name no longer of national sovereignty, but European. For the leader of the League seems a proposal out of time: Who has governed so far in Europe - retorts - think about what he did, instead of giving advice. Yet just a month ago, on January 9, in Warsaw, it was Salvini himself, after a meeting with the ultraconservative Polish leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who supported the breakup of the EPP-EDP duopoly (the socialists), to create a new family between popular and sovereignists."
" The goal is to express our willingness to govern. But with whom? In parallel, after the Italian exploit, Marine loses no opportunity to praise the Northern League which expresses a decisive opposition to the European Union and which has been favored by the fact that Italy, like France, is flooded with illegal immigration and is impoverished by the austerity policies of Brussels. The success, then, of the League would not have been possible without the qualities and energy of Matteo Salvini."
" The goal is to express our willingness to govern. But with whom? In parallel, after the Italian exploit, Marine misses no opportunity to praise the Northern League which expresses a decisive opposition to the European Union and which has been favored by the fact that Italy, like France, is overwhelmed by illegal immigration and impoverished by the austerity policies of Brussels. The success, then, of the League would not have been possible without the qualities and energy of Matteo Salvini. Well, can you copy and paste the Italian experience? Already in the second round of last year's presidential election, lost to Emmanuel Macron, she had managed to ally herself with a small sovereignist party, Debout la France (similar to Fratelli d'Italia)."
" The government last night denounced the use of the social crisis in Guyana for electoral purposes by certain presidential candidates or their spokespersons, targeting in particular François Fillon and Marine Le Pen. Marine Le Pen promises to kill the EU if electedEUROPE The National Front's presidential candidate promised at a public meeting in Lille yesterday that the European Union would die if she were elected president next May. We are going to change Europe, because the European idea is being undermined by the federalists,"" said Marine Le Pen."
 The government talks in 2015 ended with the Left forming a one-party government after a few days. Kristian Jensen has previously interpreted the DF's EU-critical line as a decisive argument against entering into government cooperation.-- But he no longer sees that disagreement as insurmountable.
" The government will work with like-minded European partners towards a system where asylum is sought from a third country rather than at the borders of European countries, it says. In Germany, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière of the conservative CDU has long floated the idea of setting up joint reception centres in North Africa, something both the Danish People's Party and the Danish government have previously praised. ASYLUM POLICY IN THE EU Denmark and Germany both want to rethink Europe's asylum system, but disagree on how refugees should be distributed.In a reply to Politiken, a spokeswoman for his ministry writes that the centres must be able to ensure an orderly and constitutional asylum procedure."
" The grand coalition between the PPE Europopulars and the S&D Euro-socialists, inspired by the similar agreement at the base of the Berlin government led by Angela Merkel, is enlarged to include the Alde Euro-liberals of former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. In this way, the three main parties aim to curb the advance of Eurosceptic movements, which last May's elections made them the leading party in France (with Marine Le Pen's Front National, which was joined by Matteo Salvini's League) and in the UK (with Nigel Farage's Ukip, which was joined by Beppe Grillo's M5S). Populars and Socialists would have had a decent majority on paper."
" The greatest satisfaction is that of having twice prevented Italy from being subjected to infringement proceedings for excessive debt, and of having contributed to the election of the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. His fear was and remains that of a League determined to oppose in a sterile way to the institutions of Brussels, isolating Italy politically and economically, and exposing it to financial speculation. The fact that yesterday, Claudio Borghi, president of the budget committee, gave an interview to the German weekly Capital proposing the exit of Italy from the single currency, sounds like a confirmation of the worst fears."
" The greatest support for the government's narrative - aside from the PiS electorate (89 percent) - is expressed by KORWiN (65 percent) and Kukiz'15 (51 percent) voters. More people agree with PiS on the issue of accepting refugees, which the PiS government - contrary to Poland's earlier commitments - does not want to agree to. Only 26% agree with EU pressure on this issue. respondents (17 percent."
" The growth of right-wing and left-wing populism, the developments in Hungary, Poland, Italy, Malta and Slovakia are alarm signals that the Turkish party leader Kurz gets along well with Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Karas likes to leave unmentioned. All the more reason for him to pick on the fact that the FPÖ likes to forge alliances with the EU opponents in the German AfD and the French Front National. Whether a black-Turkish conflict will arise over the EU candidacy is open."
" The highest percentage of voters against EU accession was revealed in the Lubelskie, Podlaskie, and Podkarpackie provinces, and working in agriculture proved to be the dominant factor influencing anti-EU voting. The biggest beneficiaries of EU transfers vote for the anti-European PiS, including in the last European Parliament elections, where PiS won in the countryside with 37 percent, while in cities over 500,000. residents received 25 percent."
" The impartiality with which ex-FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache and his party colleague Johann Gudenus talk about a possible cooperation with the alleged oligarch in the Ibiza video reveals a self-image: There is no fear of contact with Russia in Europe's right-wing populist parties and a constant willingness to cooperate, to conclude friendship treaties and to engage in financial deals. The sympathy is based on the ideological intersection in the fight against an open, liberal Western society; and on the interest in weakening the European Union. Both the FPÖ and the Lega in Italy have signed friendship agreements with President Vladimir Putin's party, United Russia. There are indications of financial and political help from Moscow."
" The impression is that he wanted above all to mark a caesura with the past; to demolish rather than build. And in a controversial way, between immigration and relations with the EU, he has succeeded. Matteo Salvini and his League have succeeded in identifying weak points on immigration. And in an unscrupulous way they aimed to exasperate them, pandering to the Five Star Movement."
" The individual cases. At the end of February, Armin Wolf spoke with Harald Vilimsky about the FPÖ's EU policy, to which Vilimsky referred with great pleasure to his companions Orbán and Salvini, adding how much the people supported their policies. This is true democracy, the people think."
" The issue at stake in these European elections comes down to a choice between two options: for Europe, with the Renaissance list supported by the presidential majority, or against Europe, with the 'nationalist' list of Marine Le Pen's party. The head of state told the press on Thursday at the end of the European summit in Sibiu (Romania): ""I will put all my energy into ensuring that the National Rally is not in the lead. After the conclusion of the great debate, he does not hide the fact that he is determined to personally engage in this campaign, at a time when his head of list, Nathalie Loiseau, shows signs of weakness, while the unexpected François-Xavier Bellamy seems able to put the right-wing LR safe from a rout that the majority took for granted. On Tuesday evening, Macron paid a surprise visit to Loiseau's running mates."
" The joint negotiations on the debt brake and the expansion of direct democracy have reopened doors that were closed in previous years. In the current issue of the magazine Zur Zeit by FPÖ MEP Andreas Mölzer, a possible Free Democratic government participation (Im dritten Anlauf) is already being discussed. After the coalition with the SPÖ in the eighties and the one with the ÖVP in the noughties, it now looks more like a new edition of black-blue."
" The judges of the Federal Constitutional Court had asked the ECJ for a legal assessment more than a year ago. In their view, the programme could violate the mandate of the ECB as well as the competences of the EU states. The AfD founder Bernd Lucke, the former CSU politician Peter Gauweiler and the Berlin professor Markus Kerber have filed a complaint against the programme. Another defeat is looming for the plaintiffs."
" The large group they want to form in the European Parliament is likely to have between 80 and 100 MEPs, but it is not certain that it will carry much weight, as it represents less than 15% of the votes in the Chamber. The RN will also have to professionalise itself and prove that it is capable of building and not just opposing the European Union. It is only by proposing a real credible alternative to Brussels and Strasbourg that the RN and its president can really hope."
" The leaders have two priorities: to decipher the scores in France in order to assess the FN's electoral evolution in the country and to measure the Eurosceptic vote in the European Union in order to detect possible allies. The FN's ambition is to have a say in the European Parliament. During the European campaign, the FN party made progress,"
" The least that can be done is the proposal to colour-code ATMs that charge a fee. The population is expected to vote on leaving the EU (FPÖ), a complex issue with far-reaching consequences, but not to make the right decision for themselves standing in front of a bank machine! Where is your voice on this issue, Mr Kern! I'll take up the alphabet soup (i.e. allergen regulations on menus). This regulation, originating from Brussels, came about at the request of the Austrian Federal Government in Brussels, Mr Rupprechter! There are other examples, but let's not go there."
" The left-wing parties and Denk opposed it. The PVV also rejected the first text that referred to an EU definition. After all, it was the European Parliament that called for its adoption, and that's when all the alarm bells go off for the PVV."
" The main thing is to generate as much emotion and excitement as possible so that FPÖ messages can be ideally loudly delivered, ideally in such a way that tabloid media get into the ping-pong game via social media. FPÖ functionaries learn early on that something will stick. This also explains why the 51-year-old Vilimsky pounced on EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday when Juncker stumbled in pain while walking and standing between the heads of state at the NATO summit for all the world to see. In the face of such images, the attack dog in Vilimsky, for whom rumours are more important than facts, sprang into action."
" The man she calls a good republican was convicted of tax evasion in 2015. Foreign Affairs and Brexit Handing responsibility for the Irish approach on Brexit to Sinn Féin would be on a par with Theresa May's reliance with the DUP in Westminster.Aside from the fact it would further strain Anglo-Irish relations, Sinn Féin has a long history of being anti-EU."
" The massive publicity it has obtained as a result of its referendum stance has helped that process. In the longer term, though, Sinn Féin s anti-EU stance could hinder the potential to widen its base by giving middle Ireland new reasons to continue rejecting the party.For Fine Gael, the polarisation on Europe has reinforced its new-found status as the favoured party of middle Ireland."
" The ministers accepted Tria's defense, which appealed to the many countries in the past with excessive deficits, including Germany and France. But they share the position of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who recalled how they all negotiated with Brussels and never questioned the principle of compliance with EU budget constraints. As instead have done vice-premiers Luigi di Maio of the M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League.Tria left Brussels cancelling the planned press conference on the two-day Eurogroup/Ecofin meeting."
" The moderator opened the block with this question: Do you see it possible that Syriza will approve the default of the debt? Do you see it as a horizon?. Colau placed the continent as a scenario for establishing an alliance of the cities and towns of southern Europe in favor of their democratization, and warned against the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the United States because, in her opinion, it impugns Catalan and European sovereignty.Podemos has raised the possibility of restructuring the Greek and Spanish debt but Raimundo Viejo, member of the citizens' council, opted for caution: We find ourselves in a system where all levels of government are linked. We will get out of the easy ideological discourse and we will have to face the hard reality of government."
 The most important electoral motives for the SPÖ were the party's concepts for maintaining social benefits (86 percent) and for fighting unemployment (76 percent). 60 per cent of the EU opponents who went to the polls voted for the FPÖ. Far behind in this group of voters are those who voted for the SPÖ (13) and for the ÖVP (10 per cent).
 The motion was introduced in the National Council after the EU exit referendum. Haselsteiner's message is now being conveyed in a dramatic Facebook video in which Hofer is described as the chief ideologue behind the FPÖ's anti-EU course. Vorarlberg's Governor Markus Wallner (ÖVP) considers the solution of the asylum issue crucial for the future economic prosperity of a region.
" The motivation of the FPÖ under Herbert Kickl has several strands: on the one hand, cold political calculation. There are so-and-so Corona deniers or sceptics (just as there were opponents of EU accession), and you occupy that niche. But there is more to it. For the FPÖ, liberal democracy is the system, the other parties are the system parties (a Nazi term). They don't want to be told anything by the system."
" The national megalomania of this camp reaches everyone regardless of their intellectual background. And by the way, in the situation as it is, PiS should - if honor is so important (and God and homeland as well) - really withdraw from the EU and show its supporters and the rest of the compatriots skeptical of the EU how it makes a leap into modernity and prosperity on its own.- How? The Speaker of the Sejm did not react to the fact that the vote was rigged."
" The new EU banking union, welfare tourism and a roadmap for all Danish EU reservations. -- But now that it is no longer the government's goal to land an agreement that could have locked the Left and Conservatives after an election, Thulesen Dahl imagines that he can change the Danish People's Party's previous position as a superfluous wing party in EU policy. This means that in all areas other than the legal reservation we can say to the people that if you want a more critical attitude towards the EU, it can also be implemented after an election."
" The new Europe will come to power - more national, oriented towards right-wing values. - Generally, the PiS line is based on the conviction that the EU is in crisis, so it will not take any harsh measures against Poland. This would provoke anti-EU sentiment in the Vistula, and after Brexit, the country cannot afford a post-Brexit, says our Brussels-based interlocutor."
 The newspaper points out that in recent elections Euroskeptic parties won seats; the result in the Netherlands will be seen as a measure of the popularity of European populists. 'It looks like the PVV is making gains. A win or seat gain for Wilders would be a huge blow to the EU. Wilders aligns himself with many sentiments espoused during the Brexit and Donald Trump campaigns.' Foreign media on election
" The non-party Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, nominated by the FPÖ, who came into the government because Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen wanted to prevent anti-EU Freedom Party members from heading this department, has been under fire for some time. Recently, she was accused within the FPÖ of refusing to make an EU election statement in favour of the FPÖ's top candidate, Harald Vilimsky, during the TV press hour. She was advised to resign immediately."
" The numbers speak for themselves: 582 votes in favor, 40 votes against and 69 abstentions. Among those in favor there is also the vote of the League, which in Brussels confirmed the pro-European turn of the leader Matteo Salvini. The sovereignist group Identity and Democracy, of which the Carroccio is part - it is the largest delegation - has split into three: yes of the leghists, abstention of the French of Marine Le Pen and no of the Germans of Afd."
" The only point on which he would not continue the traditional interpretation of the presidency in the Second Republic. This is not a quirk, but is due to the FPÖ's rejection of the EU and its economic consequences. Would he call new elections in the event of an absolute FPÖ majority? In 2018, the FPÖ will win an absolute majority and the Danube will run out of water. I beg you, he answers Corinna Milborn."
" The other day in Politiken, the Danish People's Party proposed that Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V), with the prospect of a narrow yes or no vote, should call for negotiations on a new European policy agreement that, as something new, also includes the no parties in Parliament. The aim of the conciliation was to formulate a new EU basis for Danish membership of the EU, which takes much greater account of the Danes' EU scepticism.The cold shoulder from the government is taken by the Danish People's Party's legal spokesman, Peter Skaarup, as an expression of nervousness. Tempers are running a little high, and I think that's what Jakob Ellemann-Jensen's statement reflects."
" The other day in a lunch at Palazzo Grazioli Berlusconi was clear with the leadership group: or the next program will be revolutionary, or it will not be. On Europe, how do the anti-EU positions of the Lega and the pro-EPP positions of Forza Italia fit together? Look, Berlusconi presents and proposes much more advanced solutions."
" The other filters out of Ivrea and confirms the hope that the leader places on the incumbent premier Paolo Gentiloni to convince the Pd to sit around a table with the M5S. In order to keep standing in the impossible balance between the League and the PD, Di Maio's reasoning is simple: We must be the guarantors for our allies and for the EU, both of the permanence in NATO and of the euro, especially if we will ally ourselves with the League. With the Pd it would be easier, the M5S leadership believes: Brussels and Washington would breathe a sigh of relief."
" The other top candidate, Alice Weidel, says herself that it is not the AfD but significantly the FDP that benefits from the dissatisfaction with the Corona policy. Changing this is likely to be as difficult for Weidel's party in the election campaign as promoting Germany's exit from the EU, which the election manifesto calls for. AfD top politicians come up with the demand, which is unpopular in Germany, recognisi All the more so because Chrupalla sees the alternative to the EU in a common European economic area including Russia."
" The paper is published under the intellectual ..., in any case under the leadership of the Mölzer family. Andreas Mölzer, the FPÖ's top candidate for the European Parliament, recently highlighted the Third Reich in a positive light compared to the EU dictatorship ( much fewer rules, commandments and prohibitions ); now one suspects him to be the author of a book linked to F. X."
" The parliamentary group with the Tories currently unites the Polish ruling party Law and Justice (PiS), the Sweden Democrats (SD) and the Alternative for Germany (AfD). All these groups represent similar lines as the FPÖ and Lega. The departure of the UK Independence Party (Ukip) will put another EU-sceptical group, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), in existential trouble. If Salvini succeeds in uniting a large part of all these national parties in one group, it would probably be one of the largest groups in the new EU Parliament alongside the European People's Party."
" The parties have also agreed not to join the cooperation on immigration and asylum policy and have given each other veto power to prevent it from happening later. The Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten, Liberal Alliance and the People's Movement against the EU reached a political agreement in September that in the event of a no vote on 3 December, Denmark would either join parts of the judicial cooperation via parallel agreements at intergovernmental level or by a limited application of the opt-in system. The latter will enable Denmark to participate in, for example, police cooperation in Europol at a fully supranational level."
" The parties, except for the PP, consider that Rajoy cannot go to the meeting without reaching a consensus on his position because it exceeds his powers as acting Executive since it involves future budget increases and political decisions that are forbidden to him by Government law. Rajoy has not yet appeared before Congress to report on the European summit of February 18 and 19 -that one, formally, European Council-, which approved the concessions to avoid Brexit, the exit of the United Kingdom from the Union.ShameThe secretary general of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, said via Twitter that he feels shame of the EU that systematically violates human rights. According to the emerging party, the agreement infringes on the right to asylum."
" The party abhors a European army and a European asylum policy. We do not want to become a Eurabia; we want to remain who we are,' said the PVV. The 2012 election program was called Hún Brussel, óns Nederland. In it, the fight against EU nationalism was announced."
" The party of French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has received millions in loans from Russian banks with direct ties to the Kremlin. According to Le Pen, she has no choice, because she cannot get credit from French banks. The PVV - like the FN - votes against. Since June 15, 2015, the PVV, together with the FN and some other anti-European parties, forms a European group."
" The party wants to leave the European Union. 'We must free ourselves from the prison called Brussels,' PVV leader Geert Wilders said Tuesday at the presentation of the election program Their Brussels, Our Netherlands. As he previously announced, Wilders wants to turn the September 12 general election into a referendum on Europe."
" The party's answer to the anxious question ""How to proceed with Europe? The euro area should be dissolved and EU competences should be shifted back to the member states. In order to attract even more former FDP voters to his camp, Lucke has just announced in the The AfD could enter not only the EU Parliament in 2014, but also the state parliaments of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg. There, the party received more than six per cent in each of the federal elections."

" The party's long-term goal is a northern European single currency. The PVV wants out of the EU.Striking about the paragraphs on the EU is that several parties express their displeasure with the buyout policy of the European Central Bank, namely the SP, CDA, PvdD, SGP.There are three major points of contention in the tax plans."
" The people no longer wanted to accept that the centuries-old democratic nation-state of the peoples should be destroyed by the profoundly undemocratic construct of the EU without separation of powers. So much for the hope that a few reforms in Brussels could break the anti-EU resistance of right-wing parties.Glaser knows how much the historical claim endears him to the AfD. The fact that the Federal Executive Committee decided in favour of me, who had not applied for the job, is probably due to the fact that I have been thinking a lot about the state, politics and history. He begins the conversation with countless subordinate clauses, which, if left unfinished, give the impression that there is still a lot to come."
" The phase before that was marked by intensive discussions about the advantages and disadvantages of membership. At that time, the governing parties SPÖ and ÖVP as well as the Liberal Forum were EU supporters FPÖ, the Greens and the KPÖ EU opponents. The Greens and the Left distrusted above all the capitalist orientation of the Union and feared poorer environmental standards."
" The political agreement gives each of the parties veto rights in this area, whereas a legislative text can in principle be amended by a majority in Parliament, says Kristian Jensen. -- But what is it that the Left and the Danish People's Party, along with most other parties, are so opposed to Denmark becoming a part of? The EU's common legal and immigration policy consists of about 17 legal acts and directives, much of which is uncontroversial and in accordance with Danish law. For example, the 'Reception Directive' sets out requirements for asylum seekers' access to the labour market and education, which Danish immigration law already meets."
" The pollsters were predicting the certain victory of the No, Brussels was beginning to lick its lips, it would be the penultimate move before the accession of Switzerland to the EU and the ECB (I would add: with the disappearance of the penultimate democratic country in the West, incorporated into this Europe of bankers and bureaucrats, we liberals would be left with only Israel). Once the polls opened, here is the surprise: the majority of citizens, and the vast majority (!) of the cantons, approved the Udc proposal, Ticino played a significant role, thanks to the League. The reaction, of the dark forces of reaction, was violent. The Eurocrats of the EU, of the ECB, including the various kapos of the Strasbourg Parliament, expressed horrendous concepts of a Nazi-communist stamp. So did the unsuccessful Swiss parties and the government."
" The populist cards are far from being shuffled in Europe. And our moderate election result should not be a mandate for Brussels to stop caring about anti-European sentiment. After all, the PVV won seats. The Forum for Democracy, which is pushing for a Nexit, entered the chamber with two seats."
" The positive impact of EU membership on the country at every level from dramatically improved living standards to the creation of a more fair and tolerant society is obvious to most people. Nonetheless a strident minority has resisted the EU at every stage of its development. Sinn Féin, a variety of small left-wing groups and a hardcore right-wing minority have seen Europe as a threat rather than an opportunity and at times have been able to win short-term approval from the electorate in referendums.Ó Cuív now wants to drag Fianna Fáil back to its pre-1960s position as an isolationist party out of the European mainstream and he has followed the logic of his position by suggesting that Sinn Féin would be the most appropriate coalition partner in the future."
" The possibilities for doing so are a bit limited, Tusk said, because it is a party initiative, not the Dutch government. Premier Rutte - partly under pressure from the PVV - has an ambitious agenda in Brussels. He wants to persuade the European Commission and EU member states to adjust the European migration rules so that the Netherlands can take a stricter approach to family reunification.Also, the Netherlands wants to contribute less financially to the EU; Dutch ministers are now trying to find support for this position in visits to EU capitals, in the run-up to the multi-year budget negotiations."
" The post-voting controversy has highlighted the lack of a serious debate on Italy's international position and the role it should play in Europe. . We navigate by sight, with the League hostile although aware that outside the euro would be chaos, Forza Italia that is of proven pro-European faith but allied with the anti-European League, the 5stelle struggling to develop the contents of their presence in Brussels.The future of Europe is in the hands of the new commissioner: with Germany and France that have some aches and pains and England that with Boris Johnson will accelerate the Brexit, Italy could play an important role, supporting the measures that she announced in her inaugural speech: from the European unemployment reinsurance fund to the introduction of a minimum wage system that should avoid inequalities within the Union, from the completion of the banking union to the transition from austerity to a flexibility granted for investment, from the digital tax to pro-environmental measures.Those who voted for Ursula von der Leyen have approved this ambitious program and it is right that she should indicate the people who should accompany her.© Confidential reproduction0"
 The potential here for growth and jobs in the Europe of the future is enormous. It is no wonder that the EU-sceptics/opponents in the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance are on this bandwagon. And the Conservatives are probably at their worst to stop the party heading towards the threshold.
" The president of LR, Laurent Wauquiez, simply does not print. The leader of Debout la France aims to be the decompression chamber between right-wing elected representatives who want to leave the LR shuttle and those who are deserting the drifting frontist ship, like the FN MEP Bernard Monot recently.That leaves the second option. In the end, being on the same list as the FN at the European elections means proving all those who said he had joined the National Front right,"" said a person close to the MP from Essonne. And it also means having to deal with the affairs affecting Marine Le Pen and the FN, and the racist excesses of certain elected representatives and members of the FN."
" The president of the European Commission, Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker, sought to curb accusations of irritable interference during the formation of a member country's government, letting it be known that his institution would wait for the conclusion of the ongoing constitutional process and that Dombrovskis and other commissioners were speaking in a personal capacity. In Brussels, some fear that too harsh an intervention could extend the electorate of M5S and Lega, which is very critical of EU institutions. However, the Euro-socialist commissioners would not intend to implement the usual opposition to their center-right colleagues in order to protect an Italian government that they consider populist and Eurosceptic."
" The president of the Italian Bishops' Conference (CEI), Gualtiero Bassetti, addressed the Security and Immigration Decree approved by the Council of Ministers in these terms. He did not take it well the Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini: My salary is paid by 60 million Italians who want to live quietly in their homes.Stop the sanctions against Viktor Orban's Hungary if the European Council will verify that there is no risk of serious violation of the values on which the EU is based. It is the commitment asked of the government in a motion signed by the group leaders M5s and Lega, Francesco D'Uva and Riccardo Molinari, approved in the Chamber of the House, with the favorable opinion of the government, with 273 yes and 234 no. So 29 votes difference: the majority M5s-Lega, are missing 73 votes."
 The presumption of innocence apparently applies to everyone but Russia. Putin's United Russia party signed a friendship treaty with the FPÖ. Why is Russia so interested in working with EU-sceptical parties?One Russia is open to cooperation with all parties that are legally represented in their parliaments.
" The prime minister put on his broadest grin: I'm trying to accommodate you a little bit too. A few minutes after he declined a question because he never stands in commentator mode, he made extensive negative comments about PVV leader Geert Wilders' plan to leave the EU. When the PVV leader was still tolerating the cabinet, Rutte usually refused to talk about him."
" The principle of subsidiarity is being successively undermined, for example by the minimum wage in the transport industry. The second AfD speaker, Hansjörg Müller, was also to take up arms against the EU a little later. He castigated a regulatory mania of the European Union and demanded that one must free the middle class from the juggernaut of the EU."
" The pro-EU stance is important, Austrian Commissioner Johannes Hahn also said in a first statement after the result was announced. Several times, top politicians in Brussels had warned against the EU-sceptical FPÖ candidate Norbert Hofer."
" The pro-Putin leghist leader, the M5S leader who sets himself up as the guarantor of Italian loyalty to NATO. Even on Europe, Di Maio speaks more like a leader of the Democratic Party: The EU is changed by staying inside, not leaving. And then the League that says: Never with the PD, Di Maio who praises Paolo Gentiloni for the management of the Syrian affair and is ready to make agreements with the party of Renzi because unlike Fi has all the internal tools, democratic, to get to a table and say: let's sign a contract. Words of great openness towards the PD, which Salvini does not share at all: The only thing that for consistency I will never accept to do is to go to government with the left and with the PD that I'm fighting for six years.The 5 Star leader, above all, if you take it with Salvini who wants to tie regional elections and government formation."
" The proposal of the League in parliament: immediately suspend the operation Mare nostrum, 300,000 euros per day spent by Italians to help the smugglers and encourage the invasion, writes on Facebook the Secretary of the League, Matteo Salvini. Mare nostrum triple defeat, for the refugees, for the Italian government used as a cab, for a deaf EU. Only the meat merchants win, echoes the governor of Veneto and exponent of the Northern League, Luca Zaia, on twitter.. The government must stop the Mare nostrum operation, it is now an irresistible lure for illegal immigrants, adds, also on Facebook, the president of the Lombardy Region, Roberto Maroni.© Reproduction reserved"
" The proposal, however, meets strong opposition among parties in Christiansborg. In this fight, the government is supported by both the Danish People's Party and the Social Democrats, who also do not believe that it is a matter for the EU. Maternity leave is a matter for the individual countries, and we can easily handle it ourselves, says gender equality spokesperson for the Danish Parliament Karina Adsbøl."
" The question is how much to work and how long to stay. We believe that these issues should be defined by the countries themselves and not by the EU or the European Court of Justice. DF President Kristian Thulesen Dahl takes the announcement from Kristian Jensen as one of several signs that the Left is moving in the debate on welfare benefits for migrant workers, which has been going on for several years. Kristian Jensen has at least previously not been so critical of the EU system that makes it difficult for us to control these things, says Thulesen Dahl and calls on the government to forge while the iron is hot."
" The question of the democratic content of Brussels certainly counts: after all, an EP vote gives legitimacy to a power structure that a democrat at home in his constitutional state would never choose. Those who don't want to give a vote to EU wreckers like the PVV and their unsavory cronies, but are against Brussels centralism and determinism, will pass this time. To cast suspicion on such a balanced choice is Brussels arrogance of the bluntest kind."
" The racist repertoire of right-wing parties EU-Right Alliance. Most recently, the Sweden Democrats distanced themselves from the statements of FPÖ leadership candidate Andreas Mölzer. In their use of language and in their appearance, however, the parties of the new right-wing alliance in Europe differ only slightly."
" The ratification of the FO was supported by the majority of MPs from the Law and Justice party (except for Solidarna Polska), as well as the Left-wing party, the Polish Peasants' Party (PSL) and Polska 2050, while almost all MPs from the Civic Coalition abstained from voting. Now the bill on the EU's own resources will go to the Senate. However, PiS senator Jan Maria Jackowski has already announced that he will not support it. - There will not be my vote because I think a mistake has been made here."
" The reality is that the desire for less EU is widespread only among the DF and the Enhedslisten. --A NEW poll among 1,010 representative Danes aged 18-74, conducted by YouGov on 12-14 June for Tænketanken Europa, shows that even on one of the DF's core areas, asylum and immigration policy, Danish voters want more EU, not less EU.81 pct."
" The reason for this is probably a certain ideological exhaustion combined with an almost panic fear of leaving the political centre. When the SPÖ no longer even really wants to fight against the 12-hour day and the ÖVP acts as if it has no idea what privatisation means, when even the Greens come across as genteel moderates and even the FPÖ regularly and dutifully declares its support for Austria's remaining in the EU, one can appreciate how great the fear of all political actors has become of leaving that mystical centre, even if it is only a few steps away.--You can call this pragmatic; but you can also see in it a poll-based lack of courage to take positions that might not be able to win a majority."
" The reason? The possibility of unequal treatment of taxpayers enshrined therein would allow EU member states to introduce levies which, while not discriminatory in theory, would in practice only be payable by EU foreigners. This endangers the cohesion of the EU, warns Obwexer and this is exactly what Transport Minister Norbert Hofer (FPÖ) did yesterday. If the ECJ allows German motorists to be relieved at the same time as the German car toll is introduced, then Austria should do the same, Hofer said."
" The reform of the Constitution and the advance towards a federal Spain is the PSOE's bet. The public spending committed by Podemos would move Spain away from the obligations of the European Union.A Socialist government will negotiate with Brussels a flexible timetable, around two years, to meet the deficit targets, but without engaging in a struggle with the Community institutions, in the manner of the Greek government, which, moreover, was to no avail."
" The refugees should already be stopped at the external border. He had also instructed Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl (FPÖ) to raise the issue at EU level. Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the FPÖ, emphasised that illegal migration would be clearly opposed."
" The report states. These closed pages had 6 million followers, three times the total number of subscribers to the pages of the main far-right and anti-EU parties (League, AfD, VOX, Brexit Party, National Rally and PiS) combined. Avaaz campaign director Christoph Schott is concerned about the impact these disinformation networks could have in the European elections."
" The result of the National Council election is nevertheless astonishing: despite the crisis and an already announced next aid package for Greece, the number of MPs from Eurosceptic parties has not increased. Whereas the FPÖ, BZÖ and Stronach previously had 55 seats in the National Council, the country's EU sceptics will in future be represented by only 42 MPs from the FPÖ and 11 from Stronach (53 in total). One reason for the decline is the BZÖ, which missed re-entry into parliament."
" The result: Greece is just as broke as before. Vilimsky also said: ""The Greek debacle also shows the EU's inability to deal with such crises. In the previous week, the FPÖ had already cheered the result of the EU exit referendum: the 261,159 signatures were proof of the great dissatisfaction of the Austrian population with the EU. Federal Party Chairman Heinz-Christian Strache said: ""Even if the demand for an EU exit was unrealistic, there is a massive desire for change, a renegotiation of the EU treaties and direct democratic involvement of the population by means of referendums."
" The results of our guilder report showed the beneficial effects anyway. Ideally, Madlener would like to use a binding referendum to let the people decide whether we want to continue sinking into the quagmire of the European Union. The PVV member is fine with the fact that his party is no longer conspiring with the government to stop the waste of money and bureaucracy in Brussels. Especially the CDA, according to Madlener, failed to curb the power of the EU and keep out Eastern European migrant workers."
" The results of the European elections turn out slightly more favorably for the PVV than Ipsos had calculated last week. Wilders: And now on to a large Euro-critical group in the European Parliament together with the next president of France, Marine Le Pen! The euphoria radiated by the PVV leader should disguise the fact that the elections turned out lousy for the party. And it's not because of the loss of seats in the European Parliament (from five to four)."
" The right-wing anti-Europeans such as Wilders, Le Pen, the FPÖ or the Danish Folkeparti are triumphing with their warnings of foreign infiltration and Islamism. So far, the elite in Germany has reacted to the AfD's criticism of the EU and the euro only with moral indignation. Those who do not want mass immigration are part of the pack; and those who reject the euro are endangering peace in Europe."
" The right-wing conservative group around the publicists Konrad Adam and Alexander Gauland as well as the economist Bernd Lucke want to run in the Bundestag elections possibly as early as autumn, but certainly in the EU parliamentary elections in Germany in 2014. The party is the latest shoot on the protest tree against the EU, eagerly watered by both left and right. In Austria, Team Stronach and the FPÖ are courting anti-EU voters. In Belgien ist es der Vlaams Belang."
" The rule of the European Parliament is very clear: in order to form a group, you need at least 25 MEPs elected in seven different countries. The Europhobic alliance that debuted yesterday in Brussels already has 38 deputies, but they come from only five parties from as many countries: the French Front National, the League, Wilders' Dutch Provost, the Austrian Fpö and the Belgian Vlaams Belang, i.e., the Flemish independentists who want to undo Belgium. The task is less easy than you think for two reasons."
" The ruling was by majority vote, meaning that any member of the panel disagreed with it. The CT ruling includes interim measures ordered by the EU Court of Justice in cases involving PiS's judicial reforms. They are to protect the EU legal order and Polish judges. A year ago, the CJEU suspended the activity of the Disciplinary Chamber created in the Supreme Court by President Andrzej Duda and staffed by persons appointed by the politicized National Council of the Judiciary."
" The same Grillo yesterday intervened harshly: The war of Is is producing unsustainable immigration flows, Ebola is about to arrive in Italy: out all the illegal immigrants. The other historic Italian Eurosceptic pole - the League, allied in Europe with Marine Le Pen - is instead transforming itself from a northern party into a national party. Salvini has come out of the Bossian reduction of the battle against Rome and the southerners and understood that the battle on immigration is a general issue. The monopoly of the heart, of feelings, of the sharing of often irrational but not unfounded fears cannot be left to the Eurosceptic parties, the suffix euro must be a positive flag, not the instinctive transcription of the concept of far and enemy."
" The same angst, distilled into lividity by demagogues, also polarizes voters on the right, to the surprise (only for the naive...). Donald Trump in the U.S. Republican primaries, Le Pen in France, Ukip in London, Orban and Jobbik in Hungary, and in our country the reborn Northern League. Movements that are different from each other - Salvini should never be confused with Casa Pound, nor Grillo with the Front National - but which capture, on another front, the same anguish: will my children have a life worse than mine?Against globalizationRight and left that oppose the market, international pacts, the EU, global trade, technological innovation, Google-like digital corporations, mix unacceptable tones (Trump's vulgar misogyny, Le Pen's anti-immigrant nationalism) with interesting proposals (Sanders on cutting the cost of politics), but all pose an inescapable challenge to moderate leaders, progressive or conservative."

" The same applies to the word 'welfare tourism', which has only entered the Danish language in the last few years. In the beginning, few, mainly Eurosceptic politicians in Brussels used the word - today it is used not only by the Danish People's Party here at home, but also by the Left and the Conservatives, who otherwise support free movement in the European labour market. DEBATE OF THE WEEK Yes parties disagree on EU free movement."
" The same can be said of the bourgeois politicians who have reversed EU policy and insist on a principle of accrual that is against the rules of the Union. --Ahead of today's vote in the Danish parliament, the V and K parties are shaking their heads at the thought of the many voters who are turning to the Danish People's Party. The two parties have formulated a new Eurosceptic line, which is to insist on the accrual requirement for receiving child benefit that they introduced in 2012, knowing that it is in breach of EU rules. The government, on the other hand, has refused to administer against EU rules."
" The same would be true of the PiS state, where all power would be concentrated in his hands by one man in the &bdquo;central center of political disposition, about which Kaczynski writes in his 2011 &bdquo;Report on the State of the Republic. PiS is Euroscepticism. A cynical and demanding attitude towards the EU, threatening Poland's self-isolation and loss of our position in the European Community. It is national selfishness expressed by, among other things, racist prejudice against refugees."

" The second element to note is that these are not just Italian measures, but European ones. The EU has agreed on the framework and content of the sanctions: if Italy did not apply them it would have a problem first of all with Brussels. This makes me optimistic, despite the positions taken by the League, because on a practical level Italy cannot remove the measures without serious consequences.In recent times many Russian interferences in the Western political processes, including the Italian elections, have been denounced. Is getting rid of sanctions a motivation for these attacks? I think so, but we need to clarify the context."

" The sensational love couple appears to be able to appeal to many voters. Also important was that the Alternative für Deutschland, the right-wing populist party that takes a stand against Muslims and refugees, the euro and the EU, was able to re-enter a state parliament. However, the equivalent of Wilder's PVV gained only 6.2 percent of the vote, a disappointment for the nationalists. The AfD was still at ten to twelve percent of the vote a few months ago."
" The shockwave from Italy would hit the Eurozone and consequently Poland. Because of its marginalization within the EU, PiS has set its sights on Donald Trump, distancing itself strongly from the Democrats. Recall that this is about the most anti-EU US president in history, who delights in brexit and has declared that he would like to see more countries following in the footsteps of the British."
" The single currency is inescapable If he comes out with a beard, San Roque, and if not, the Immaculate Conception. It could be admitted that it is not only legitimate, but desirable, to change one's mind if it is for the better, were it not for the fact that more than a year later, just four months ago, Podemos, IU, Bildu and Alternativa Galega de Esquerda, together with Nigel Farage's UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party) and Marine Le Pen's National Front supported in the Strasbourg Chamber with their votes a proposal of the Italian 5 Star Movement to carry out an institutional reflection on the suitability of preparing an alternative plan for an orderly breakup of the euro zone. Syriza MEPs abstained."
" The so-called solidarity surcharge on banks would bring in 1.15 billion per year, according to the estimates on which its electoral program is based. One of the few references to the European Union in the television election debates came from Pablo Iglesias. The leader of Podemos advocated reducing the tax revenue gap with the European environment. Eurozone countries collected on average 46% of GDP in 2018, while Spain verged on 39%, according to data from Eurostat, the European statistical agency, published this week."
" The social factor plays a special role across the EU in the persistence of broad strata in this deep mistrust of European integration. Already in the European elections, for example, 43 percent of workers in France voted for the far-right National Front, which advocates leaving the EU. Even stronger, as is well known, was the workers' support for the FPÖ candidate in the presidential election in Austria, despite his later verbal trapeze acts. In Germany, too, many feel like losers of globalisation, and racist attacks are on the rise."
" The social security system for farmers is not self-supporting, but is financed by taxes, so ultimately taxpayers have to pay the subsidy, he said. Hebenstreit announced that if the regulation were to take place in this way, he would turn to the EU Commission. The FPÖ criticised the discussion itself."
" The solution to the dilemma could be a division of the current Eurozone into at least two currency areas with mutually flexible exchange rates, Meuthen suggested. Germany could then maintain its performance in a stable currency area, for example together with Finland, Austria and the Netherlands, without at the same time competing with other economically weaker EU states to the point of collapse.Although the AfD is not represented in the Bundestag, it wants its demand for a referendum on Grexit to be discussed in parliament. Meuthen believes he has found a way to do this."
" The sovereignty of the allies and Attilio Fontana's declarations on the white race put Berlusconi in difficulty in front of his Ppe friends. He is also embarrassed by the words of Marine Le Pen, who speaks of the Italian vote as the beginning of a new Europe and of her ally the League, which would be building an enlarged coalition with the fight against the EU at its center. For Le Pen on one side are Macron and Merkel, the globalists, on the other are the nationals."

" The spread rose to 310. March will be the month in which the citizenship income will start and a month before quota 100, reiterated Luigi Di Maio. In Europe they are graphomaniacs, stressed Matteo Salvini: We do not move an inch, he added.MEPs of the M5s and the League voted compactly, yesterday in Strasbourg, against the EU budget program. The Italian government is preparing to veto it, as announced at the Interministerial Committee for European Affairs at the end of October."
" The stakes are high, because for the government of the PIS, a possible move of the Alliance summit out of Warsaw will mean the destruction of its ability to conduct foreign policy and massive perturbations on the domestic scene. PiS does not value the EU, treats Germany with reserve (euphemistically speaking), and wants Poland to play the role of a regional leader, which is to be achieved by becoming the main US ally in Central and Eastern Europe. Washington's refusal to grant such status will show that on the international stage the Pisowski king is naked because he has no real trump cards in hand."
" The story of Podemos' trajectory corroborates this thesis: since the 20-D elections, Iglesias has offered the PSOE the formula of a coalition between the two formations, which would require the active or passive support of Catalan sovereignism and Basque nationalism. A formula that would have to be based on the conjugation of both programs, which in their original formulation are incompatible, especially because of the references to the EU: Podemos' program would be absolutely unacceptable to Brussels, leaving something that Iglesias has been very careful not to clarify in the indefinition. Tsipras' adventure sets in any case a disturbing precedent since the Greek Prime Minister, after winning the elections with a radical program, has ended up submitting to the Troika after a long journey of irrationality and a disturbing 'corralito' for the citizens."
 The strange friends of the FPÖ EU Parliament. The FPÖ forms a parliamentary group with other right-wing parties.
 The ten key measures of the FN The immediate suspension of the Schengen agreements and then the exit from the euro and the European Union after negotiations and a referendum: this is the keystone of the project to leave the European UnionRetirement at 60
" The text of the singular guidelines on Christmas to be deleted in the internal communications of the EU seems rather like the unsuccessful birth of the Eurobureaucracy, which has long championed the LGBT+ movement and other rights, including religious neutrality, and has imposed them among the cornerstones of European policy, even to the point of discomforting the rule of law against conservative governments in Eastern Europe, always with the applause of the left. In Italy there are those who have written that it was a mistake to abandon Christmas to the right, admitting that the League and the Italian Brothers have received on a silver platter yet another reason to challenge Brussels. But the story was immediately set aside by newspapers and news as an injury, to be forgotten as soon as possible."
" The text will be voted on today. European right-wing politicians criticised the EU's interference in return. The FPÖ MEP Andreas Mölzer declared that the EU should stay out of the power struggle in Kiev. Moreover, Russia's legitimate interests should also be taken into account."
" The text will be voted on today. In turn, European right-wing politicians criticised the EU's interference in Ukraine's internal affairs. The FPÖ MEP Andreas Mölzer declared that the EU should stay out of the power struggle in Kiev. Moreover, Russia's legitimate interests should also be taken into account."
" The then Prime Minister David Cameron, who was not in favor of brexit, miscalculated to appease UKIP radicals and against his will ultimately pushed his country out of the EU. Similar to the former British Prime Minister, the head of the current Polish government Mateusz Morawiecki, who comes across as rather pragmatic when it comes to the EU, is forced to bow to Solidarna Polska and the Europhobes of the Law and Justice party, who have benefited from a huge propaganda apparatus in the country since their party came to power. Like the British, the Poles have begun the process of articulating admonitions and demands to the EU that they believe they can completely control."
" The time for an abstract argument about what the treaty should look like in the best of all possible worlds is over. Fundamentally anti-EU parties like Sinn Féin insist that they are not really anti-Europe, but somehow they always end up campaigning for a No vote.Fianna Fáil sources insist that the party is not in the business of competing with Sinn Féin for the populist anti-EU vote, but the party needs to stake out a clear position if it wants to put those concerns to rest."
" The times are too serious, Söder gave as his reason. Everyone could see where criticism of Europe would lead, namely to Brexit.Both Söder and Weber attributed the Dexit, i.e. Germany's exit from the EU, to the AfD as a goal. They want to distinguish themselves sharply from the right-wing competition."
" The triumvirs are very different in program: a liberal-Catholic party, albeit authoritarian and managerial, one populist and one sovereignist. Those who are part of the European Popular Party, which elected as president the blue Tajani, want to change the European Union to stay in it, arm in arm with Germany; the League is part of the group of Farage, is skeptical about the euro and the union; and FdI, which has no MEPs, is instead close to the sovereignist right of Le Pen. The triumvirate is limping along."
" The truth is, the responsibility is ours for the state of our country. As we approach the latest referendum for greater EU integration, its opponents such as Sinn Fein will give voice, as in the past, to the dishonest slogan 'If you don't know, vote No'. If undecided how to vote, it's honourable to abstain, rather than vote 'Yes' or 'No'."
" The two coalition parties are not united in their attitude towards the right-wing nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) MEPs voted unanimously last Wednesday in favour of criminal proceedings for violating fundamental EU values. Those of the FPÖ voted against.The decision required a two-thirds majority in the EU Parliament, which the Parliament believes was achieved: 448 MEPs voted in favour of the procedure, 197 against."
" The two referendums held in our country showed that the majority had no idea what they had voted for. They had not read the European Constitution ('I am voting against because I am against Balkenende') and had not read the Ukraine treaty ('I am against the accession of Ukraine to the EU', while that was not in the treaty at all). It would be nice if critic Martin Bosma and the rest of the PVV would also admit their (many) mistakes. Referendum ii"
" The undersecretary of Palazzo Chigi, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has a plan in his head: to wrest from the European Union a targeted flexibility on emergencies. Exempt from the ceiling of 3% of the deficit spending for specific investments that convince Brussels of their urgency. Monday will explain the contents to the parliamentarians of the League that Matteo Salvini has gathered in view of the work on the maneuver, then, Wednesday, will put them on the table of the government summit dedicated to the Stability Law. Giorgetti was given the role of wise elder."
" The warnings of a debt union will not go away, but so far they have had little effect. In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court gave its blessing to the EU's new form of financing after a complaint by an initiative of AfD founder Bernd Lucke. And in Austria, too, only the FPÖ warned against a sell-out of the state and more competences for the community.What does this innovation mean for Austria? With the ratification by the National Council, the way is clear for bonds to be placed on the financial market by the EU Commission."
" The weaknesses of the French and German economies are well known, but what concerns Italy above all is not the high debt, it is the political uncertainty, hence the political instability. In addition, of course, to the growth of Euroscepticism, amplified by parties such as the League and Fd'I, which have an important consensus. D. Will the European Union be able to overcome the post-Covid-19 economic crisis or will we see it disintegrate? A. The EU is in a moment of great uncertainty, aggravated initially by the indecision of the Commission and the statements of ECB President Christine Lagarde in March."
" The yes side is made up of the Socialist Party, the Social Democrats, the United Left, the Union for the Republic, Civic 10, and Per San Marino; the no side is made up of the Network Movement and Noi sammarinesi, while the Christian Democracy calls for a blank ballot and the People's Alliance leaves the vote free. As for political fragmentation, there is nothing to envy to Italy. Although they are only two, the parties for the no are very combative, so much so that they have called an Italian deputy of the League, Gianluca Pini, to conclude the election campaign and explain why joining the EU is a mistake: Let's not commit, says the invitation to the event, the mistake that Italy committed at the time. And two anti-euro economists have already been hosted, to the applause of the supporters: Claudio Borghi, of the Catholic University, and Antonio Rinaldi, professor at the University of Chieti-Pescara, united by the rejection of Europe. How can we accept the free movement of people provided by the EU?It's not true, says Claudia Mularoni of the committee for the yes, we will go to a negotiation and we will negotiate the conditions of the adhesion, safeguarding our peculiarities, as it has happened for other States.The two committees face each other, also on the web."

" The yes to Brexit forced the suspension of events and a change of pace for leaders. In the debate on foreign policy broadcast yesterday by EL PAÍS, party representatives - José Manuel García-Margallo (PP), Josep Borrell (PSOE), Fernando Maura (Ciudadanos) and Pablo Bustinduy (Podemos) - were in favor of strengthening the EU, but disagreed on how to do it.Pages"
" The ÖVP adheres to all the pillars of the EU internal market, including the free movement of persons. However, it is already accommodating its coalition partner by indexing child benefits for EU foreigners. FPÖ party leader Heinz-Christian Strache, however, wants even more restrictions for workers from other EU countries. At the end of May, he suggested changes to the EU rules on freedom of movement at the Europadialog discussion event."
" The ÖVP delegation in the EU Parliament avoids the FPÖ FPÖ MPs isolated because of membership in Le Pen group, EPP decision prohibits contacts Aunlike in the federal government in Vienna, the ÖVP and FPÖ have a certain hardship in dealing with each other in Brussels. When it comes to the work of the coalition partners in the EU Parliament, the head of the Freedom Party delegation Harald Vilimsky the FPÖ is represented in Strasbourg with four mandataries is annoyed that the FPÖ MEPs are cut by their Christian Democratic colleagues. We are also the same party in government, not willing to move from our positions , he said on the sidelines of the plenary session in Strasbourg."

" The ÖVP is now putting up posters for its top candidate, Othmar Karas: Europe starts here in Austria and Europe needs professionals are the slogans. At their presentation on Thursday, Karas made it clear once again that he rejected the EU policy of his government partner in the federal government: ""I am not in a coalition with the FPÖ in Europe. The subjects with Karas, whose head forms the O of Europe, are signed Team Volkspartei. On two other text subjects in yellow and turquoise, three options for voting are offered, two of which are crossed out: Make Europe better is offered there instead of Whistle on Europe or Dance to Europe's whistle."
" The ÖVP's top candidate Othmar Karas is also generally considered to be the most suitable. ÖVP and SPÖ could be strengthened in the EU election in May, the FPÖ has hardly mobilised yet. The Greens are likely to remain in the EU Parliament."
" The Öxit envisaged by FPÖ candidate Norbert Hofer would probably be the worst service that could be done to Austria, Schieder explained. Hofer had brought a referendum on Austria's withdrawal from the EU into play if the EU opted for more centralism. FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache draws somewhat different conclusions from the British decision. You can love Europe, but you don't have to be a lover of EU bureaucrats, said the club leader."
" Their hostility to the fundamental principles of the EU was illustrated by the fact that they even voted against the EU's withdrawal agreement with the UK when the issue came before the Dáil last November. That is why Martin performed a public service at the launch of the Fianna Fáil European election campaign by pointing out the real possibility that Ireland could send to the parliament a number of MEPs who have a fundamentally anti-EU position, and will spend endless hours pursuing false conspiracies about EU militarisation.His effort to highlight the approach adopted by Sinn Féin, Flanagan and others to Russia, and their hostility to free trade on which this country's economy depends, was probably the first many Irish people had heard of their record in Europe. It begs the question as to why other pro-EU parties, particularly Fine Gael, have failed to take an equally robust approach to exposing that record."
" Their objective: ""to replace"" those who are today ""at the head of this totalitarian system that is the European Union, and to give power back to the people"", Marine Le Pen explained on 8 October in Rome, during a press conference with the leader of the League and Minister of the Interior in the Italian government of Giuseppe Conte. The RN president added that what would be at stake here was, no more and no less, ""history with a capital H"". Salvini repeated this ambition at the beginning of January in Warsaw (Poland). For him, it would be a question of ""forming an axis on the defence of values, in order to carry the revolution throughout Europe""."
" Their possible members may be similar in basic tendencies, but in many areas they do not come together. Some tend to pursue economic policies that have been seen as left-wing in the past, others, such as parts of the AfD, believe in a liberal economic course. Some support the European Union, while others think integration within the EU is the devil's work. But above all, this International will perish because of one of its common features: its nationalism."
" Thematically, there will probably be no way around the high unemployment figures in Europe. This is also accompanied by the question of the extent to which the European Union has drawn the right conclusions from the economic crisis. The FPÖ will confront its criticism with the more or less pro-European parties SPÖ, ÖVP and the Greens. The Neos, on the other hand, will try to give the term Europe a positive emotional connotation."
" Then Voves became even clearer about the most tasteless posters he had ever seen: ""Please don't be seduced by the FPÖ! They are not social, they have voted in parliament against means-tested minimum income and against employment programmes. But Voves said that he would not be forbidden to talk about unwillingness to integrate in the future, but that had nothing to do with the FPÖ's general xenophobia. Susanne Winter also got her comeuppance for her comments on the EU army: ""I've never seen anything so crazy! shouts Voves, and Defence Minister Gerald Klug laughs in the audience. Later, at the other end of Herrengasse, at the Eisernen Tor, someone else got his fat: Michael Häupl."
" Then the cases would be noted so that if the legal position was determined differently, they could be reopened. According to the head of the department, he first became aware that the Ministry of Integration's Immigration Office had been mishandling young stateless persons' citizenship applications for about six months when he returned from summer vacation in August 2008. He stuck his head in with the head of the department, Kim Lunding, who briefly mentioned the problem after a long chat about the hottest issue of the summer - the consequences for Danish immigration policy of the EU's Metock ruling, which had put the Danish People's Party in the red.During a matter-of-fact, yet relaxed talk in the minister's office, Birthe Rønn Hornbech was presented with the problem of stateless persons."
" Then there is another center-right, Forza Italia, which is in the EPP, which says it does not want to leave the euro although it is a bit confused, which is among a thousand doubts in the reform process but outside the government. And then there are Lega and Fratelli d'Italia who are with Le Pen and out of everything: euro, government and reforms. In a very difficult historical moment for this area (it had not been since 1958 that a party exceeded 40%), we, even though we were just born, together with the Udc, passed the barrier and took one million and 200 thousand votes."
" Then, however, started the propaganda that has annoyed the grillina leghisti: There is the postponement of the calls (Laura Castelli and Mario Sibilia); I'm happy that Salvini has changed his mind (Stefano Buffagni); Respected the contract (Danilo Toninelli). And Armando Siri (League) rejoiced because the EU funding is safe.The President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani (FI), speaks of a government without courage and calls for a referendum."
" Then, if she loses the presidential election, the dial will be turned back a bit. At the EU summit in Tallinn, Chancellor Christian Kern has now registered that the other EU heads of state and government view his possible coalition with the FPÖ with concern. And added that such a participation would be particularly stupid. This is also a precept for his own party, in which there are friends of a coalition with the FPÖ."

" Then, in the campaign itself, to recommend something different. -- But EU concerns don't stop there. The DF may quite often vote with the Japanese in the daily work of the European Committee, but the party still wants out of the Schengen cooperation, keep a long distance from the EU banking union and introduce border controls that the Left does not want.In addition, Thulesen's thoughtful disregard for the SF's government record here at home and the Fremskritt Party's in Norway."
" Then, it's okay to have clear rules and transparent criteria. Extreme choices do not appeal to me or the premier, said the League leader. The European Union has proposed a plan for a major overhaul of its economy directed at combating climate change, with the aim of reducing the bloc's dependence on fossil fuels. The commission's plan, dubbed Europe's Green Deal, aims to achieve the bloc's most recent commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement, the 2015 accord that calls for countries to limit global warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."
" There are a few possible alliances through which the party can gain direct influence. For example, an alliance of the Eurosceptic parties with the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance, which together can muster 60 mandates and thus, according to the constitution, can provoke referendums on certain laws. But overall, a large part of the political influence of Enhedslisten is moving out of the Folketing."
" There are also differences on foreign policy issues: For example, the People's Party, in contrast to the Freedom Party, wants to support the EU-Russia sanctions. FPÖ MEPs voted completely contrary to the ÖVP on the issue of tax transparency for corporations."
" There are hundreds of children running around naked among giant rats. There is a problem of human rights and children Word of Matteo Salvini, the secretary of the Northern League in the second day of electoral tour in Turin between a blow to the bureaucrats of Brussels - Europe that deals with pandas can not ignore what happens in the Roma camp in Turin - and the left, guilty of having forgotten parts of this city, even San Salvario. If this is the appetizer of Chiamparino governor then we are in place, poor Piedmont."
" There are no more national borders On the G7 summit in Bavaria A small note in the press explains the current successes of the FPÖ and the rampant EU scepticism better than any editorial: Due to the controls during the G7 summit, 10,000 violations of the Residence Act were detected quasi incidentally. The concrete benefit of the Schengen Agreement for the average citizen is the elimination of waiting times in front of barriers when travelling to neighbouring countries: for example, twice a year on holiday in Italy or Croatia and twice when shopping in Sopron or Excalibur."
" There are other parties of the Italian center-right - underlined the president of FdI-AN alluding to FI - that raise their voice against this Europe, against the EU with German traction, but then being in the Ppe they do every day the interests of Germany. . Meloni did not rule out interactions with the Northern League, another party that already has an agreement with Le Pen, on the euro issue, while nothing to do with the 5 Star Movement, closed to dialogue.© Confidential reproduction0"
" There are those who prefer to call it the Party of the Hill or a synonym, even resorting to the surname of the President of the Republic. To move it is the growing identification of the two (other) government parties in the vice-presidents, intent on a fight without quarter against the EU.To tell the truth, Matteo Salvini is the undisputed ruler of the League, while Luigi Di Maio is subjected to influences, even heavy ones: from the founding comedian, from the other diarch Davide Casaleggio, from the left wing of M5S (led by the President of the Chamber of Deputies), from the orthodox or movementists or faithful to the origins, among whom Alessandro Di Battista stands out, whose return to his homeland threatens the entire movement. The third party moves, from time to time, he who would be the decisive character, Giovanni Tria, always more scrambled and probably always more doubtful (who made me do it?) and, therefore, always less able to concretely oppose the perennial electoral campaign of the Dioscuri."

" There are two main reasons for this: The Carinthian Freedom Party continues to hang like a log on the leg of the Strache FPÖ, and that will not change any time soon. The Team Stronach, on the other hand, attracts part of the protest potential in the right-wing camp because it operates with similar themes and moods (anti-Euro, anti-EU, party disgruntlement) as the FPÖ, but not quite as crudely (anti-foreigners are missing). Above all, Stronach is newer, fresher than the old party, the FPÖ."
" There has been a high degree of consensus, both in Dáil Éireann and among commentators more broadly, about what Ireland needs to do and what its priorities should be. One key point of consensus has been Ireland's loyalty to the EU. Even traditionally Eurosceptic parties like Sinn Féin have made it clear that they consider continuing EU membership vital to Ireland's interests. It is interesting to remember that this was not always clear that this would be the case."
" There is a Bureau decision prohibiting EPP MEPs from any cooperation with the ENF group. That's why even Group leader and EPP top candidate Manfred Weber, who wants to become the next EU Commission President, has declared the ENF's EU sceptics with the FPÖ as main opponents. This suits Karas, who (like Kurz) maintains a close relationship with Weber, who comes from Bavaria."
" There is a clear parallelism with this reformulation of the right wing that is taking place in Europe, in Hungary, in Poland, it is obvious that there are parallels, but to me the French National Front seems more radical than Vox. Political scientist Guillem Vidal, professor at the European University Institute, clearly places Vox in the extreme right, but establishes two subgroups, the fascist extreme right - in which he would place the Greeks of Golden Dawn - and a radical populist extreme right in the style of Marine Le Pen: That's where I would place Vox. A style of parties that emerged in the eighties and that dissociate themselves from fascist ideology and focus more on going against immigration and against the European Union."
" There is a second deadly mixture: the combination of nationalism, ignorance, fear, selfishness, the sap of extremist movements. Beppe Grillo's claim that the euro should not be a taboo, the positions of the Northern League, the abolition of the euro pursued by Marina Le Pen in France are a fitting example of the narrow-mindedness of many Europeans. A further opponent is organized crime, at ease in the chaos, intolerant of any rule of civilized life and which would like to transform Europe into an immense Lebanon."
" There is also agreement when it comes to asking the banks to pay for coping with the financial crisis and state aid worth billions for the banks (such as Hypo Alpe Adria). The SPÖ is pushing for an extension of the increased bank levy, the FPÖ wants higher revenues from the banks through tax changes. On EU policy and the euro, however, the leaders of the SPÖ and the FPÖ are divided - in contrast to many voters. Chancellor Faymann stands by the euro bailout fund."

" There is an aversion to risk sharing, laments Moscovici. It is difficult for Germany or Holland, with their own internal populism, to accept to extend their mantle over the Italian banking system with a government like Salvini's. Also complicated in Spain, where the budget plan has been agreed with Podemos and where a Eurosceptic force such as Vox is emerging. In the face of the North's growing reluctance to accept further integration, Italy and Spain should be more confident than ever in intelligently securing a solid umbrella for their banking and public debt."
" There is disagreement within the FPÖ about the line on the European Union and on a possible Austrian exit after Brexit. The Upper Austrian party leader, Manfred Haimbuchner, spoke out clearly on Wednesday against an EU exit campaign in the presidential election. The FPÖ is certainly not an EU exit party. You can't speculate with that, says Haimbuchner."
" There is no evidence that party donations actually flowed through the association, which was founded in Vienna in 2015. The association is also not non-profit in the sense of the law on associations (which is important, because parties are not allowed to receive donations from non-profit associations), but its goals are, as excerpts of the statutes available to the profile show - and they overlap with the FPÖ programme: e.g. promotion of patriotism, information on EU misdevelopments, cultivation of Christian occidental culture, establishment of a think tank.But what is most interesting are the people working there."
" There is no guarantee that Russia will cease attempts to influence our political decision-making. Putin's trolls additionally have the support of Dutch politicians from the PVV and Forum for Democracy, who also believe that Brussels is the enemy, Russia is an ally and Brexit is the Valhalla. Alexander Doegin, Putin's thinker and advisor, had a very cordial conversation with Thierry Baudet in the Western Church last year."
" There is no trace of optimism for progress and a world view open to science, technology and Western values, but instead a lot of romantic nature romance. We certainly sympathise with the AfD's Euro-critical stance, which is primarily a criticism of the arrogant behaviour of the EU nomenklatura. After that, however, the affection already stops."
" There is not so much communist babushka about her, she told Ekstra Bladet in March 2015. In the DF it is sometimes thought that Berth goes too far, because he has expressed a greater EU-scepticism than Messerschmidt, Thulesen Dahl and other leading members. That's why the EU rapporteur is sometimes told that he doesn't have to open his mouth every time a journalist calls."
" There is something for children in a showcase in the aisle. Balloons, colouring books, an EU board game. But from now on it's all downhill. The critics are coming. Too much EU is stupid, claims FPÖ leader H. C."
" There was also a problem of specification yesterday regarding the FPÖ's position on the EU in general and Austrian EU membership in particular. According to Vilimsky, the Freedom Party has at no time and under no circumstances advocated an Öxit - that is, Austria's exit from the EU - because the FPÖ is known to be the first pro-European party in the country. What the FPÖ had advocated in 2016, according to its general secretary, was a survey of the Austrian population on the course of the European Union in view of the centralisation of EU structures that was emerging at the time and Turkey's imminent accession to the EU."
" There was speculation that the former Vienna municipal councillor had deviated from the party line on many issues. A dispute over the failed EU-US trade agreement TTIP became well-known. At the time, Herbert Kickl, who is now the leader of the FPÖ parliamentary party, publicly chided his party colleague for not rejecting the pact in its entirety. The Vienna public prosecutor's office, which is investigating the matter, is playing coy."
" There, only fundamental reforms of the EU - with Germany's continued membership - are demanded. Only if these reforms, which are intended to strengthen the sovereignty of nation states, cannot be implemented, does the programme envisage leaving the EU in the distant future. But the question is - and this is the next big disagreement in the AfD - whether they believe that the EU can be reformed. Storch does not believe in it."
" Therefore, Denmark cedes sovereignty. Parliament could have voted the patent court through with a 5/6 majority, but since both Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti said no, the Danes have to decide today.What happens in case of a yes? 25 EU countries have agreed to introduce a unitary patent valid in all countries.This costs about 50,000 kroner and is available from the European Patent Organisation (EPO) in Munich."
" Therefore, for Salvini and Tosi, it was necessary to try to get out of the straitjacket of northern Italy. This goal could be achieved either by changing the mission of the party (Salvini hypothesis), replacing the enemy, from Roma ladrona to Bruxelles ladrona; or (Tosi's hypothesis) by building, instead of the Northern League, a national party of the center-right, able to collect the non-extremist and neanderthal votes of the League, combining them with those disappointed by the center-right of Berlusconi (who now leads a party reduced to the minimum terms), adding them with those not expressed by the many who did not go to vote and without forgetting the votes that have remained attached, moreover more and more feebly, to the stump parties of the center-right that in fact are less and less credible.Why, in this race for political repositioning, has Salvini, for the moment, won, and Tosi lost? Because Salvini, by becoming the Italian Tsipras, has managed to rapidly intercept an electorate that is generically angry with the entire world. An electorate that was just waiting for a scapegoat against which to run rampant with lowered horns."
" Therefore, the Danish People's Party has changed its position. First, the party talked only about the benefits of a British yes vote, which would open up new avenues in the EU. Now the DF also sees opportunities for Denmark in a no vote. But what exactly does Denmark need a British no for? DF counting on goodbye to Cameron Denmark's largest Eurosceptic party no longer identifies with Nigel Farage & Co, even though Morten Messerschmidt shared a group with Ukip in the European Parliament until the 2014 elections."
" Therefore, the chances of the British choosing this construction are slim. In practical terms, it would mean that the British would have to adopt the same tariff policy towards third countries as the EU, whereas they prefer to regulate this themselves. Nexit Lower House rejects PVV motion for Dutch EU referendum The Lower House voted overwhelmingly against a motion on Tuesday calling on the cabinet to make every effort to hold a referendum on Dutch EU membership as soon as possible. PVV leader Wilders had made the motion."
" Therefore, the need to help our businesses to diversify in terms of both products and markets is more urgent than ever.' He called on the European Commission to come up with support plans for Irish industries. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald blasted Brexit as a 'Tory vanity project' and said the priority had to be to preserve the Good Friday Agreement, 'every letter, every dot and every comma'. She warned against allowing the British to fudge the border question at next week's summit."
" Therefore, we hope that the parties will be able to execute it on schedule. This was stated by a spokesman for the EU Commission led by Jean Claude Juncker.The League corrects the reform of cooperative credit banks wanted by the Renzi government in 2016. With an amendment to the tax decree, filed in the Senate Finance Committee, the Carroccio actually cancels one of the key points of the reform of cooperative credit: the mandatory membership of groups, thus saving the autonomy and territoriality of Bcc. The cooperative credit sector was at the center of a summit at Palazzo Chigi Senator Nicola Morra (M5s) was elected president of the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia Commission."
" These are confirmations. Brussels observes what is happening in Rome with a conspicuous hint of apprehension. The League's attacks on the Treaties have made the continent's fears official, causing the Carroccio summit to rise up. Salvini points to the unacceptable interference of the Europe of the unelected, which threatens and blackmails."
" These are controversies that will become boulders or pebbles depending on the vote. But the concern remains that the majority will relegate Italy to the margins of the EU, if M5S and Lega and their anti-European allies do not have the success evoked by the gialloverde executive..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" These are policies that would have delivered jobs to the very electorate that Donald Trump was reaching out to but the easier sell for electoral purposes was that free trade was bad. In a lower key way in an Irish context opposition from parties like Sinn Féin to an EU/Canadian free trade deal saw Fianna Fáil abstain on a vote in the Oireachtas on a policy it spoke openly in favour of in that same Oireachtas. In the end the vote didn't matter and the trade deal was ratified but the point was clear, Fianna Fáil was at risk of being dragged away from positions it supports just to remain competitive with Sinn Féin."
" These are sound principles that Denmark supports. And it is the first step towards a more permanent solution to the EU's problems.What is the alternative? The Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance want the Euro to collapse. That countries go bankrupt ( yes, they actually say that directly."
" These claims helped to create a public mood which led to the rejection of the treaty by the Irish electorate the first time around. Fianna Fáil European candidate for Midlands-North-West Brendan Smith, who has also tried to focus public attention on the long history of Sinn Féin's anti-EU rhetoric, was right to suggest that that the Brexit Party's use of McDonald's speeches should not come as any surprise. For those who have listened to the party's recent claims to be pro-European, the emergence of this video is a timely reminder of the real values at the heart of Sinn Féin, said Smith who pointed that while the Lisbon Treaty was rejected by voters at the first time of asking, it was passed in a second referendum after legal assurances about Irish neutrality."
" These days, there is a fierce battle to win the protest vote on the far right. Several parties are breathing fresh air, fighting each other and thinking of merging in line with the growing EU scepticism and the Danish People's Party's ideas of government.Pennies currently spent on foreigners and integration will, according to the new national liberal party, instead go directly to tax cuts."
" These differences are now crystallising into two electoral attitudes that are in stark contrast. Eurosceptics who express an intention to vote in the next European elections choose above all the list of the Rassemblement National (63%) and, to a lesser extent, a list of the right of the right (18% for the lists of Les Patriotes and UPR).. Note that only a small minority would opt for a list from the left of the left (9% for a LO, PCF and LFI list)."
" These disqualifications were reinforced by the CSU, for example, with the phrase ""asylum tourism"". Just like the contempt for the EU that is widespread in the AfD. More than a few CSU politicians and their supporters expressed gloating satisfaction after Merkel failed to commit all member states to a European solution at the Brussels summit."
" These elements will benefit Denmark as well as all other Member States - not just the UK, said Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Not least the Danish People's Party has been pushing for the government to back the Eurosceptic line in Britain and fight for concessions itself. With this week's draft, that agenda has got legs, says Lars Løkke."
" These go much less far than on the right. The PVV wants out of the European Union, the SP is more mildly euro-critical. And the PVV's tone on migration also stands on its own."
" These parties are the Latvian National Alliance, the Bulgarian VMRO and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania AWPL, but not until August 2019. As a result, PiS party allies have very limited influence in the EU Council.Support for the parties comprising the ECR (excluding the UK) in elections and polls remains mostly in the 5-15 percent range."
" These two nations, as Bank of America also points out, will hold general elections next year and their results could be directly affected by the ramifications of Brexit.Italy and Spain, the third and fourth largest economies, respectively, in the euro zone, would also feel the consequences of the UK's exit. The Five Star Movement and its referendum on Italy's position in the EU, explain Barclays, would gain positions. Podemos, in the case of Spain, is not opposed to the European institutions but has shown its rejection on more than one occasion to the austerity policies that, they say, Brussels promotes. Portugal is in a similar situation, says Alex Fusté, chief economist at Andbank."
" These were mainly used by the president to illustrate his Choose Consent and Security slogan and to criticize his main competitor. - Poland, he said, is safe thanks to its membership in NATO and the EU, so those who question the point of the EU are wrong.Clearly, because on this issue the PiS mortgage is extremely loaded. The party opposes deepening EU integration, although it is clear today that there should be more EU, not less."
" They also advocate for Europe-wide minimum social standards. The ÖVP and the FPÖ, on the other hand, have in common, among other things, that they both reject Turkey's accession to the EU. Apart from the ÖVP, only the BZÖ wants tuition fees."
" They also said that - in order for this principle to apply - it is necessary to change the EU treaties. The debate over the United Right government's announced veto of the future EU budget and Reconstruction Fund is stirring up huge emotions in Poland. Solidarna Polska politicians, who co-govern with PiS, are urging Mateusz Morawiecki not to give in to the EU, and Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro has even suggested he will be a soft touch if the prime minister gives in. The opposition warns that the veto will condemn Poland to isolation and will mark the beginning of the country's exit from the European Union."
" They are already under enhanced supervision by the Troika (the inspection team of ECB, EU and IMF) because they are receiving emergency support. According to the PVV, the EU spy should go back to Wallonia with pitch and feathers. According to MP Van Dijk (PVV) the arrival of the controller is a sign that Europe is getting a bigger and bigger grip on The Hague. The Netherlands is becoming a puppet of Brussels,'' Van Dijk said."
" They are an investment in our future. The mayor of Goslar continued: Everywhere we see these anti-European parties, the AFD in our country, the National Front in yours. It is so unfortunate that Europe has a negative influence."
" They are in a process of destructuring, perhaps they have even minimised the impact of my departure. We see a total disorganisation,"" he insisted, stressing that the FN had abandoned the social fight and the fight against the European Union, which for me is terrible.Therefore, Mr."
" They are in agreement with the coalition partner. Defence Minister Mario Kunasek (FPÖ) already said a few weeks ago: For Austria as a neutral country, a common EU army is not an issue. Within the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), it was formulated more diplomatically on Wednesday: a strengthened and better coordinated security and defence policy within the European Union was needed, they said. It is important, however, that Austria's neutrality is preserved in all cooperation."
" They are the nostalgics of the mythical and romantic 'nation', the supporters of building walls and expelling immigrants, and of nation states recovering their sovereignty usurped by the Brussels bureaucracy. In the case of Spain, because of its affinity with Salvini and Orbán and its extreme nationalism, Vox identifies with this clearly anti-European policy. Podemos has also been characterized in the past by its appeals to sovereignty against the dictates of Brussels. On the contrary, PSOE, PP and Cs are strong advocates of the integration process, and therefore they are obliged to explain which Europe they defend and how far they are in favor of advancing federalization."
" They are the nostalgics of the mythical and romantic 'nation', the supporters of building walls and expelling immigrants, and of nation states recovering their sovereignty usurped by the Brussels bureaucracy. In the case of Spain, because of its affinity with Salvini and Orbán and its extreme nationalism, Vox identifies with this clearly anti-European policy. Podemos has also been characterized in the past by its appeals to sovereignty as opposed to the dictates of Brussels."
" They could have come at a better time, both for Italy and for the European Commission. At least two clues signal in these days how fragile is the framework within which the different fields of force - the 5 Stars, the League and the technical ministers, the highest levels of administrations in Rome and Brussels - will have to seek a synthesis. Firstly, the data on the performance of the financial markets says that Italy today is, in a technical sense, isolated in Europe."
" They don't know what they want Right-wing parties at odds over future EU. AfD politician drafts three-step plan for a new Europe After Brexit, Europe's right-wing populists are like the supporters of deeper EU integration: they don't know what to do next either. There is even a mirror identity."
" They expect us to treat them differently. If the FPÖ repeatedly criticises the refugee agreement between the EU and Turkey, this does not make much sense for Kern without presenting an alternative proposal.Now the focus is on the integration of those who are already in Austria, and I would ask you for your support in this,"" the Chancellor said, taking the blue opposition party to task."
" They have no regard for Europeans, on the contrary: Russian President Vladimir Putin is doing much to divide Europe with the help of his EU-sceptical right-wing populist vassals. Extreme right-wing politicians like Marine Le Pen or Matteo Salvini are happy to play along, in Austria the FPÖ, which is loyal to Moscow.Iin such a critical world political situation, the EU and its member states can only help themselves. But how? Juncker will soon step down."
" They have thus made a policy against the previous coalition agreement. He cites the voting behaviour of the FPÖ MEPs as examples. For example, the FPÖ mandataries had voted against extended competences for the border protection agency Frontex and the strengthening of the EU's external border protection. They voted against a better exchange of information between national tax authorities."
" They need to change, as we outlined in our manifesto. Sinn Féin would seek support for changes at an EU level and in the shorter term we will work to achieve the type of flexibilities to these rules that have been afforded to other states within the EU.There is a growing consensus that the rules do not work and must be changed and changed significantly."
" They turned around and left, the deputy speaker of the Diet stated. He added that if things go the way they are going in our relations with the EU, we have to look for drastic solutions.The PiS politician later argued on social media that Poland was, is and will be a member of the EU. Polexit is a crib invented by PO and TVN24. Today there is a fight over whether the EU will be faithful to its founding principles or whether it will sink into disputes fueled by the total opposition."
" They vote for far-right, Eurosceptic parties. Instead of countering, the government is swearing at Brussels. Worrying.Different from the Fitna affair, Dutch diplomacy is not doing organized damage control in the riot over the PVV site. In 2008, ambassadors were sent out to explain that the government distanced itself from the film, had nothing against Muslims but respected freedom of the press, and so on."
" They want common rules so multinationals pay corporate tax, they want to use the EU to tackle environmental and climate problems, they want to fight social dumping via the EU, and they are warm supporters of the single market. If anyone is out of touch with reality and living in an ideological cheese-box, it is those who imagine that the Danish people want less EU. The reality is that it is only the DF and the Enhedslisten that want less EU.--A NEW poll among 1,010 representative Danes aged 18-74, conducted by YouGov on 12-14 June for Tænketanken Europa, shows that even on one of the DF's core areas, asylum and immigration policy, Danish voters want more EU, not less EU."
" They went into a faction with the EU-sceptical Polish PiS. 2010 Cameron narrowly won the British election, becoming prime minister only in coalition with the Liberals. In the economic crisis since 2008, opposition to the EU grew among the Tories. Until then a strict opponent of Brexit, Cameron now promised to hold an EU referendum by the end of 2017 at the latest if he wins the next elections."
" They were mostly against. Against the establishment, against the euro, against globalization, against immigration, against the European Union and against parliament itself. The best thing you can do as a euro-critical party, PVV's Auke Zijlstra said earlier in an interview with this newspaper, is to exacerbate the viscousness. We do that by constantly raising objections, by basically just being annoying."
" They were quickly disillusioned. Not only has no country even considered following the British example, but the Eurosceptic or Europhobic political forces have experienced a series of electoral setbacks since that date, which have forced them to rule out any exit from the European Union or the euro, such as the Rassemblement National, the Austrian FPÖ, the Italian League or the Swedish extreme right. And since the Brexit, the attachment of European citizens to the Union is at an all-time high, which explains this."
" They will go to the polls en masse to manifest their support for the Union. PiS is now frantically trying to convince them that it loves the EU, but it is not clear whether voters will fall for it. The residents of large cities, where the opposition won an outright victory in the local elections, are also going to the European elections."
" They work in the tabloid media, which often dominate the political public sphere with their saga and morsel journalism on EU issues. The parties often throw themselves at their feet, they all play along: the Greens (and NGOs) when they campaign against EU free trade in front of US chlorinated chickens in TTIP; the SPÖ when they drum up cheap slogans about an EU of corporations instead of people; not to speak of the FPÖ. On the other side are the Neos, when they naively to uncritically cultivate the idea of a United States of Europe completely illusory."
" They're all spin, no substance,' Mr Martin said. 'Leo himself created the unit that was going to cost five million to promote themselves and here they are now, the last great photo op, getting up at five in the morning to go to the port to be photographed.' Mr Martin also said his party is the one to lead Irish unity and warned of Sinn Féin's 'anti-EU' policies and history.Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe yesterday said Commissioner Hogan was simply 'outlining the reality that our country is facing'."
 This agreement is meant to be a leaven for deeper cooperation between populist and far-right forces in the European Parliament. The European Union is still hesitating whether or not to react firmly to the PiS government's violation of treaty principles. Advocates of dialogue led by outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel are trying to tone down supporters of cutting off PiS from money.
" This alone was an enormous challenge, said MP Alexander Bernhuber. The politician considers a 60-percent reduction to be simply unrealistic. It makes no sense to set unrealistic and counterproductive targets, criticised the EU environment spokesman of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP).The FPÖ does not want to agree to any of the proposed reduction values. The report of the Environment Committee was rejected by the liberal EU parliamentary group on Monday."
" This also became clear in the attitude towards the European Union. The old FPÖ had been a supporter of European integration, of Austria joining the EU. Even the national wing, whose representatives saw it as a kind of (re)affiliation with Germany, at least of an economic nature."
 This also suggests that government leaders want to put the issue on hold for a while in view of the European elections in May. A proposal on binding contracts from Brussels would be grist to the mill of Europhobic parties such as the PVV in the Netherlands and Ukip in Britain during the campaign. Controversial is also a possible solidarity mechanism that should accompany a member state contract.
" This apparent contradiction in a candidate who had defended in his first steps nothing less than European sovereignty is an exercise in lucidity. As the great integration theorist Joseph Weiler has explained, it is only by recovering the appreciation for the identity of each country, which has been brutalized by liberal democracy and subject to the discipline of the European institutions, that the moderate vote can continue to decide the governments of the EU Member States. The anti-system demagogy of Le Pen, Wilders or in Spain of Podemos leads to the sovereigntist exaltation against the European project and globalization, as if they were two identical realities. In the face of this dangerous caricature, it is useless to use economic data and unemotional technocratic language to justify the benefits of global economic openness."
" This approach may create difficulties in Italy, Spain and Germany because the management of agricultural funds, which is now partly in the hands of the Regions, would be centralized in those of the State. The proposal of the EU Commission does not like even the Minister of Agriculture Gian Marco Centinaio and the League. The Council likes it in principle, but the EU Parliament does not."
" This becomes clear when the past voting behaviour of their MPs or public statements of their politicians are taken into account. FPÖ MPs have so far not supported any further development of the EU, even if this would have been in line with their own party line. For example, FPÖ MEPs abstained from a vote on more competences for the EU border protection agency Frontex, voted against stricter controls on persons at the EU's external border and rejected (with the exception of one MEP) a stronger exchange of information between the 28 national tax authorities to fight tax avoidance by international corporations."
" This central point of Marlene Wind is missed by Rune Lykkeberg, who avoids dealing with her actual criticism. In the worst DF manner, he instead places Marlene Wind as someone who kneels at the altar of the EU - even though her whole concern is criticism of EU policy.Rune Lykkeberg's editorial is fortunately not in line with Politiken, which usually distinguishes itself by a somewhat useful EU coverage."
" This could be, for example, the holding of a second Brexit referendum. Further negotiations on an exit deal were also rejected by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The FPÖ is already thinking aloud about a European Parliament without Britons. The Blue top candidate for the EU election, Harald Vilimsky, can imagine his party joining the Conservatives and Reformers group, which currently still includes the British Tories."
" This did not diminish his success with the voters. With more or less two issues - immigration and criticism of the EU - the FPÖ gained ground from election to election, even almost won the federal presidential election, and at the last National Council election, with 26 per cent, was already close to the all-time high under Jörg Haider in 1999 (27 per cent).Heinz-Christian Strache has been largely uncontroversial as leader in the party all these years."
" This does not mean that all the contents of the respective parties are congruent. The Front National has an extremely critical EU line. There, it is moving strongly in the direction of withdrawal. That is not the line of the FPÖ. Not even in the party programme."
" This government is very weak and will not be able to pass major reforms, although it will have the obligation to manage. Perhaps it will manage to form majorities on specific issues, but Brussels is there to treat us like the Greek Tsipras.The great chastity belt that binds Podemos is not the Spanish Constitution, but the Treaty of the European Union. In fact, Iglesias is no longer repulsed by the Spanish constitutional text as he used to say a few years ago, but has made it his own to reinterpret it as he sees fit."
" This has already had an impact Werner In terms of content, the FPÖ has to a large extent prevailed. But what does that mean for a party that actually only has two issues, precisely this policy on foreigners and criticism of the EU? As I said, it could end up that the FPÖ is no longer really needed. But it does not necessarily have to be that way."
" This has been one of the Leave campaign's key criticisms of EU membership. That is why the EU's upcoming free trade agreement with Canada (CETA) is mentioned in London as a possible template, and the Danish People's Party is now taking notice. The party has previously raised critical questions about CETA, which will be discussed in the Danish parliament's European Affairs Committee on Friday, but is preparing to vote yes when the agreement is ratified in parliament."
 This has never happened before during an EU Council Presidency. The FPÖ must get out of this group.The federal government wants Austria to pay no more into the coming EU budget than it has done so far. Can the SPÖ support this?
" This in turn also overlooks the obvious fact that the level of funding - (EURO)2.4bn for the seven years 2007-2013 alone - comes because Britain and Ireland are both EU member states. But the time has come to also see how the North's two big political parties can be influenced to take a stand in favour of EU membership. Sinn Féin has come a long way since sharing Maggie Thatcher's Euro antipathy in the early 1990s, and this issue will be a real test of the party. We will need to see it unequivocally urge a Yes to EU membership in the North."
" This is - authoritative sources of the two parties of the yellow-green majority explain - the deep political sense of the certainly non-trivial communiqué, jointly signed by the two vice-premiers Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini. And therefore, the League and the Five Star Movement reject Brussels' request for a reduction in the deficit/GDP ratio planned for 2019. The Minister of the Economy thinks differently, whose position - not from the point of view of the armchair, of course, but from that of the possibility of seriously affecting events - at this point seems really weakened. A scene captured yesterday at the Buenos Aires airport bears witness to this."
" This is a novelty, as it has only recently been possible to hold such a referendum. GeenPeil, a collaboration between GeenStijl, Citizen's Committee EU and the Forum for Democracy, is the first to make use of this. But it's not just about the treaty with Ukraine, Baudet says."
" This is a real headache for the editorial staff of the broadcast media. . From midnight on Friday, it will be forbidden to broadcast polls and estimates, but what will happen if, for example, as early as Thursday evening, i.e. three days before the French vote, Dutch television stations mention the scores of Geert Wilders, leader of the eurosceptic PVV party (Party for Freedom) and future ally of the FN in the European Parliament? How will French TV stations treat the subject? Wouldn't such a victory (or defeat) influence the vote in France?"
" This is a serious mistake by the Civic Platform. What the Law and Justice party is trying to convince us of, i.e. that we must not talk abroad, is dirty blackmail, which must be rejected. The European Union is not only a union of states, but also a community of nations. The European Parliament is also our parliament, and Polish women and men also elect members of this chamber."
" This is a sham democracy. Even the elections are not waited for in order to quickly rush this controversial treaty through the House of Representatives.' His logical conclusion: the Netherlands must leave the EU. It is out.If that happens, the Netherlands, under the architecture of the PVV, will become a nationalistic fortress that enshrines its own culture as dominant in the constitution and prohibits all threats to it by law. Those who believe that Islam has disappeared from this story are mistaken."
" This is a token construct. Ridiculous reports are being taken note of, says local councillor and European spokesman Wolfgang Jung, who himself sat in the EU Parliament as an FPÖ representative in the mid-1990s. There are many important issues, especially for the citizens of Vienna."
" This is a tricky box, according to Morlok. AfD leader Jörg Meuthen was outraged by Weber's demand: ""Manfred Weber, in his brazen arrogance of power, has now revealed himself to be openly anti-democratic: anyone who criticises the EU, which he (Weber) wants to preside over as the next Commission President, should no longer receive any funding in future. Weber fantasises that the AfD wants to abolish the EU. What nonsense, Meuthen said."
" This is a very cross-sectional opinion, since about half of the voters of all parties, with the exception of the centrists, think so. Which Italian leaders express the most critical positions towards Europe? First of all, the Northern League secretary Matteo Salvini (26%), a staunch opponent of the EU and the euro, which he provocatively defined as a crime against humanity. He is closely followed by Beppe Grillo (23%), then Matteo Renzi (15%) and Silvio Berlusconi (12%)."

He is closely followed by Beppe Grillo (23%), then Matteo Renzi (15%) and Silvio Berlusconi (12%)."
" This is deliberate confusion and obfuscation. The FPÖ is an EU-sceptical party, as it was under Jörg Haider, who in 1994 said Njet to the Union with the Maastricht Treaty, specifically: the Euro, open borders, common foreign trade, common security, etc.Strache's FPÖ is not coincidentally in the right-wing group with Le Pen's Front National in the EU Parliament."
" This is due to, among other things. The government of Law and Justice (PiS) is reluctant to deepen the European integration, as well as the low efficiency of the bureaucracy responsible for the implementation of EU programs aimed at rural areas and agriculture.Rural residents have significantly improved their standard of living, the state of infrastructure, access to education, and unemployment has fallen."
" This is evident from the quarterly report Burgerperspectieven (Citizens' Perspectives) by the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP). Next Wednesday, a consultative referendum will be held on the association treaty between the European Union and Ukraine. The SP and PVV, together with the Party for the Animals and 50Plus, are campaigning against the treaty. The other parties recommend voting for the treaty."
" This is not our intention and Europe has to get over it. An approach shared by the League. I need to see the letter that Europe wrote. Of disputes the EU does a lot. Even the European Court had challenged our behavior on the Sea Watch and in the end gave us reason, is the observation of the undersecretary to the Presidency of the Council, Giancarlo Giorgetti."
 This is particularly important now that Britain is about to leave the EU. Britain's departure will tip the balance of power in the EU in favour of southern Europe.A heated debate on the EU is set to take place in Parliament this autumn. The Finns and the Christians will do their best to prevent Finland from participating in the EU's stimulus package. The Coalition has criticised the fact that the stimulus package has cut EU funding for research and security.
" This is rather characterised by a commitment to the European Union and gives the impression that little will change in EU policy as a whole. On the one hand, this is due to the coalition partner, for whom approval of the EU was a prerequisite for government. On the other hand, the FPÖ had already scaled back its EU-critical rhetoric, because in a climate marked by Brexit shock and Trump, little popularity can be gained with anti-European policies. The FPÖ has hardly changed into a pro-EU Paul."
" This is shown by the latest poll from Megafon, conducted for Politiken and TV 2. The Danish People's Party is thus just above the psychologically important 20% support from voters, while the Social Democrats are still below this mental threshold. POLITICAL ANALYSIS The Danish People's Party remains the country's second-largest party, but it has not thrown up its hands.--In recent weeks, the EU debate has dominated the public debate, and the Danish People's Party has been the only critical party to avoid doubts about its line. The Left, the Conservatives and Enhedslisten have taken a more muddy line, wanting to highlight major criticisms of the EU, but at the same time willing to look at a solution with the government that retains the scheme."
" This is stated in the draft election program presented by Thierry Baudet's party on Boxing Day. In it, FvD advocates, among other things, an intelligent withdrawal from the EU, the European Court of Human Rights and various UN treaties, such as the UN Refugee Convention. National laws should always prevail over international laws from now on, the party believes."
" This is statistically extremely unlikely. What is also to be expected for this election: that the FPÖ will turn it into a vote on Austria's EU membership. After the UK's decision to leave, Hofer can back the EU sceptics, especially in a clash with Alexander Van der Bellen, who is a clear EU supporter."
" This is the real battleground between the new and old majorities. In concrete terms: between the aggressive and anti-European approach of the former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, who brought millions of consensus to the League but total clash with the EU; and the technical one of his successor Luciana Lamorgese, called to replace him with a less polemical but firm and rigorous attitude. It is clear to all that the discriminating factor between victory and defeat, for Giuseppe Conte's second executive, will depend on how he handles the migrant problem; and conveys a sense of security to public opinion after the alarm fueled by the League."
" This is the result of a market survey conducted for the STANDARD during Holy Week. The greatest scepticism prevails in FPÖ voter circles, while ÖVP voters have the most positive attitude towards the EU. The ÖVP's top candidate Othmar Karas is also generally considered to be the most suitable."

" This is true democracy, the people think. And when asked if his ally Marine Le Pen wanted to destroy the EU, Vilimsky said that there were small differences, that the FPÖ did not want to destroy, only to change. And viewers think to themselves: who wouldn't want that?"
" This is what the PVV proposes in its election program presented yesterday. The program is largely a plea to leave the European Union and the Eurozone. PVV leader Geert Wilders wants to turn election day, September 12, into a referendum: ,,Do we continue, or do we step out of Europe? The PVV program refers to the Eighty Years' War from 1568 to 1648. According to the party it also started because the inhabitants of our country had to pay taxes (the tenth penance) to the European super state of those days, the Spanish empire.According to Wilders, it is not easy to leave the EU, but it must be done . ,,This is therefore not an election program, but more of a declaration of independence."
" This is what the recently defeated FPÖ presidential candidate Norbert Hofer said now: If the Union is going wrong, then for me the moment would be when one says: So, now one must also ask the Austrians. Similarly, the AfD: If the EU reforms it is calling for cannot be implemented, board member Alice Weidel told Die Welt, then it would have to be clarified whether a third step is necessary: that in Germany, too, the people decide whether our country should belong to an EU that cannot be reformed. Admittedly, there are also other opinions on this within the AfD: Thuringia's AfD leader Björn Höcke wants an immediate referendum and to leave the EU as soon as possible. But this is not the majority opinion in the AfD for the time being: Weidel's other scenario is in line with the party programme.#NAME?"
" This is what the surrender of the judiciary to Nowogrodzka, the weakening of local governments and NGOs, the strengthening of the role of state-owned enterprises, and now the attempt to eliminate independent media, including TVN and TVN 24, is supposed to serve. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who sees no reason not to publicly reveal his totalistic beliefs, as he expressed them in an interview, also raised concerns about the prevalence of opposition on the Internet... In relations with the EU, PiS is counting on Hungary's veto in the European Council and on EU institutions to act lege artis - slowly and inconsistently. Reading the consecutive verdicts of the Court of Justice of the EU and the European Court of Human Rights, listening to the reactions of the European Parliament and the signals coming from individual capitals, I am convinced that the leaders of Law and Justice have much less time than they think."
" This leap by the government may be blocked by the European Commission, which is reluctant to change the entities that distribute the funds. PiS had the idea that all responsibility for EU structural funds, much of which is at the disposal of provincial governments, should be taken over by provincial governors. This proved difficult to do, as all regional operational programs would have to be renegotiated with Brussels."
 This made closer cooperation with Austria's neighbours on security issues more difficult in the long run. The ÖVP/FPÖ government installed in February 2000 came under pressure from the 14 EU partners. Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner saw that Austria lacked partners and wanted to strengthen cooperation with the Visegrád countries plus Slovenia with a Regional Partnership.
" This may have to do with the successes of more or less right-wing populist parties throughout Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. This certainly has to do with the fact that the FPÖ has abandoned crucial issues such as a possible exit from the EU in the hope of joining the government.That's a good thing."
" This means that Denmark cannot introduce permanent border controls. --And the DF believes that Denmark must be able to do this. However, the government's agreement with the EU presupposes that Denmark remains a member of Schengen.So DF must approve Danish membership of Schengen to get the new agreement."
" This means that it is no longer necessary to have an outright European policy agreement, says the Prime Minister. It has long been an open question how the leader of the opposition, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, will put together EU policy if, as the polls predict, he regains power. As a result of the Danish People's Party's pronounced EU scepticism, the UK government operated in EU policy throughout the 00s with an alternative EU majority comprising the Social Democrats, the Social Democrats and the Radicals.-- But in recent years, the Left has moved towards the Danish People's Party, not least on the issue of EU citizens' rights to Danish welfare benefits."
" This means that nothing stands in the way of ratification of the treaty by the National Council before the summer. The EU's trade agreement with Canada continues to cause political turmoil. The FPÖ campaigned intensively against the pact during the election campaign and demanded a referendum. Since the party no longer wants to know anything about either, it has a double justification problem, says political scientist Peter Filzmaier."
 This means that the issue of foreigners is once again on the agenda - although no one could have seriously assumed that the FPÖ would abandon its most successful campaign hit in this election campaign of all times. The other FPÖ issues also come as no surprise: the Freedom Party is backing the EU sceptics and criticising above all the euro bailout and the opening of the labour market for Eastern European countries. And they promise a whole range of social benefits: Higher pensions or higher family allowances.
" This means that we want to cooperate at the European level for the benefit of all, for example in border protection and trade, but we want to remain sovereign as a nation-state. If the European Union had gone our way instead of fighting for the superstate of the European Union the British would not have left the EU.Q.- A link between AfD, Vox and other parties of the European patriotic family is migration policy. AfD fights to keep migrants out and Vox to keep them out."
 This new group says quite clearly: you cannot join forces with the forces of the Visegrád group that block a fair distribution of refugees. Just as little with anti-EU forces such as the AfD or others. Our aim is to move forward a Europe that needs to change and that has missed the opportunity in recent years to be more in touch with people's concerns.
" This not only causes fragmentation, but also instability, because when the question is Europe, many voters from the left and the right can coalition against it, nothing to do with Spain. Looking at our boring European election campaigns our country does not cease to be an oasis where despite the shouting, Vox, Podemos, ERC, PDeCAT, EH-Bildu and company share support for EU membership, the euro and the most important European policies. Not even in the toughest moments of confrontation have we seen any of them advocate leaving the EU or the euro."
" This picture is confirmed by a good turnout. --OVERALL, the most striking result of the election is the significant advance of the Danish People's Party, which with over a quarter of the votes is now the EU party with the overwhelming support among voters - and the most seats. The DF's rise comes mainly at the expense of the Left, which is facing hard work to stop the voter exodus."
" This ratio has been virtually stable for many years. Only among PVV voters is a majority (72 percent) against the Netherlands in the EU, but the group that is actually strongly against this is much smaller. At the SP, 45 percent are opposed."
" This secret agreement must be stopped, Greenpeace representatives said in Berlin. In the European Parliament, a closing of ranks is even in the offing: Both the FPÖ group leader in the EU Parliament, Harald Vilimsky, and the Green mandate holder Michel Reimon are in favour of breaking off the EU's talks with the USA on a free trade agreement."
" This she accepted. In Geert Wilders' eyes, the FN has become acceptable becauseFollowing the same anti-European battle horse, the PVV and the FN will make common cause against the euro, against Brussels and against mass immigration into the EU."
" This spring, the Left has not missed a chance to paint the devil on the wall in connection with the discussion on welfare tourism. In addition, there is the DF, which as you know was founded as a Eurosceptic party, and the Liberal Alliance, which is sometimes for and sometimes against. The party of the financial sector is f."
" This time it was about an important confrontation: the opponent, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache is not only fishing in the same voter segment, he is also dueling directly with Spindelegger on the question: who is the real challenger to the Federal Chancellor. Strache acted as the more aggressive challenger, and the topics set by ORF were no disadvantage: immigration and the EU - these are the areas in which the FPÖ leader is at home. Spindelegger defended himself vigorously at times: Stop making people feel insecure, he said to the warning that EU foreigners would cause high unemployment."
" This time the Slovenian presidency, represented by Foreign Minister Anze Logar, has chosen caution: In light of recent legislative developments in Hungary - he said -, it is clear that family law or school curricula are a national competence. However, the principle of non-discrimination is enshrined in the treaties of the EU.--The debate in plenary showed that for most MEPs (not for Lega and Fratelli d'Italia) incisive action is needed by the Council and the Commission against the continuous deterioration of the values of the EU in Hungary and Poland. Member States - protest MEPs - are blocking the Article 7 procedures against Budapest and Warsaw (the mechanism that provides for the suspension of certain rights of a country if it does not respect the rule of law) and the Commission does not protect the EU budget."
" This time, the liberal bankruptcy mass is of a different order of magnitude: there, the leadership question has been resolved superficially, perhaps, but quickly and without any major potential for division. Schwarz-Blau II, on the other hand, disintegrated much more quickly than the first edition of this coalition format little time to win over (even) more FPÖ voters, despite the EU-bashing of recent weeks.Political Instinct"
" This was a consequence of the assassination of the Constitutional Tribunal and the appointment of the double judges by PiS. The government of Beata Szydlo reacted allergically, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Witold Waszczykowski together with the public media taken over by the government started a campaign against the EU. In off-the-record conversations, diplomats appointed by the Law and Justice party accused the European Union and the Council of Europe, which also criticizes Poland, of acting in collusion with Civic Platform politicians. Over time, ambassadors appointed by PiS began to join this chorus."
" This was followed by a dispatch from FPÖ Secretary General Kickl, which spoke of Mölzer's withdrawal from his candidacy for the EU elections. Mölzer's spokesperson then announced via the Austria Press Agency that Mölzer was withdrawing completely from the FPÖ list for the EU elections. More detailed explanations would only be given after the party executive on Wednesday."
" This was the view among the most progressive in the capital, and the historian Marcus Rubin wrote reassuringly in a German journal in 1911 that only fools and people without influence still believed in reunification, says René Rasmussen. The capital's creative class does not understand that there are actually plenty of good reasons why so many people in southern Jutland vote DF and are sceptical about the EU. They don't say 'no to the community'."
" This way could lead to the destruction of the Union, at least as we know it today. Kaczynski's allies in this process include Salvini, Le Pen and Orban. If we see how consistently Law and Justice is building its own model of state, which sometimes directly contradicts EU values, we cannot pretend that the threat of postlexit is real. PiS is changing the country in all areas."
" This week, EU parliamentarian Morten Messerschmidt, who has returned from sick leave, announced that within five years he could well imagine Denmark following Britain out of the European cooperation, which he calls a losers club, to Dagbladet Børsen. This is far from the first time that the Danish Liberal Democrats have cast doubt on the party's support for Danish EU membership. In a 2011 portrait book, Morten Messerschmidt said he sees Denmark's interests best served by getting out."
" This week, both are allowed to compete in the ORF duels. Karas is in the ring against Werner Kogler and Andreas Schieder, Edtstadler against the FPÖ's top candidate Harald Vilimsky, who has had a de facto monopoly in the camp of EU critics and from whom Team Kurz now believes it can win voters. Whether this will succeed will be the exciting question in the last days until the election on 26 October."
" This would mean Denmark's withdrawal from Interpol cooperation, and we would have less chance of preventing and solving cross-border crime, including terrorism. The DF claimed that Denmark could only get a parallel agreement with the EU. But of course the EU cannot give Denmark such an agreement when the Danish people have voted against it.The reality is just far worse."
" This would mean triggering an infringement procedure, thus exacerbating relations between Rome and Brussels. It would arrive, so, to the European elections with the maximum of tension between Italy and EU, throwing gasoline on the Eurosceptic fire. It may be that the League is fine like that, because it thinks to get a further electoral benefit. But what about Antonio Tajani, to whom Silvio Berlusconi has entrusted the task of ensuring compliance with the rules and on this he plays Palazzo Chigi? As for the grills, there is an obvious contradiction between the last minute pro-European oaths and what Luigi Di Maio has been saying in the recent past, not to forget the tin drum played by Alessandro Di Battista, Roberto Fico and Beppe Grillo.But it is not only a matter of respecting the strictures of the stability pact."
 This would turn a pro-European conservative party of the people into a nationalist conservative party of direction in case of doubt. This nationalist party would be capable of joining and forming coalitions with the far right. AfD party leader Jörg Meuthen does not expect any progress from the upcoming EU special meeting on migration policy.. No substantial approaches and solutions to the current migration crisis can be expected from Mrs Merkel and Commission President Juncker.
" This would ultimately be a decision of the voters at the next National Council election. But I can only confirm what Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: The FPÖ cannot do it. At EU level, however, it is in no way a suitable partner. The FPÖ is working in Europe with forces that want to abolish the euro, destroy the EU, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, abolish liberal democracy and undermine the debt crisis. All these points are directed against Austrian interests."
" This, he added, would not leave Spain isolated internationally, but would be making its own foreign policy and not subordinate. In his opinion, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has lost its meaning and, in addition, being part of it has to do with what is happening to Spanish farmers because of the Russian veto. The leader of Podemos alluded to the Russian veto on European agricultural exports due to EU sanctions as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.Iglesias hopes that his party will have a program as soon as possible - we need it - and insisted that this program will be the basis for any post-electoral agreement. According to what he said, Podemos is not sectarian and will be willing to agree with whoever wants to put an end to revolving doors, make a tax reform so that the big fortunes pay taxes or create more positions for tax inspectors to fight fraud.Police-Civil Guard UnionAsk about what would be his policy regarding the State Security Forces, Pablo Iglesias said that, in line with what members of the Unified Police Union (SUP) and the Unified Association of the Civil Guard (AUGC) have told him, he would be willing to open the debate on the unification of the different forces and listen to the experts."
" This, in turn, led Vilimsky to take a shot at Van der Bellen on Wednesday and to reiterate his accusations against the Commission President. The Federal President was a frustrated Green who belonged to the EU establishment, which he had always criticised, the FPÖ Secretary General and MEP was quoted as saying in Österreich. And Vilimsky also questions the Federal President: He is elected, but he does not act in a non-partisan way, he is not my president."
" Those in Western Europe have slowed down for the time being (France, the Netherlands, probably also in Germany), those in Eastern Europe (Visegrád states) are in power: in Hungary, in Poland, in the Czech Republic the president is one. They want a different EU, namely an illiberal, nationalist one. Of course, that's what the FPÖ wants too, and it will probably get into government.Where will the new Austrian government turn: Merkel/Macron or Orbán/Kaczy ski?"
" Those who predominantly see disadvantages, however, deserve a closer look: it is noticeable that women, inhabitants of rural regions and, above all, declared FPÖ voters tend to see themselves as disadvantaged by EU accession. Pfarrhofer: Seen in this light, it is logical that the FPÖ and its top candidate are taking a sharp stand against the EU. This obviously works, because one can see that those who feel disadvantaged think to an above-average degree that Harald Vilimsky would be a suitable representative of their interests in the EU."
" Those who thought that this time there would be a political debate in Austria without reaching into the lowest drawers now know better: once again, Nazi trivialisation and racist slogans are being used to win votes. FPÖ top candidate Andreas Mölzer first drew a comparison between the EU and the Third Reich and then, after an audio document was made available, also admitted to using the term Negro conglomerate at a public event. He apologised for this."
" Thoughts of leaving have no chance in this country. This should be borne in mind when the governing FPÖ party will now wage an anti-EU election campaign in association with far-right European parties. For them, the only chance to achieve some success is that many EU supporters do not go to the polls."
" Three out of five respondents disapprove of the right of Romanians and Bulgarians to work in all EU countries from 1 January next year. . A quarter of Britons and French, 19% of Italians but also 18% of Germans and 12% of Spaniards, traditionally very pro-European, are ready to vote for Eurosceptic parties, such as the National Front in France and Ukip in Britain, in the next European elections."
" Through blind EU hatred, the PVV, which bills itself as a friend of Israel and misses no opportunity to condemn Islamic anti-Semitism, almost torpedoed the very definition that is supposed to make fighting anti-Semitism easier. The anti-EU frenzy preceded; the PVV only agreed to a modified text. Drizzly."
" Thulesen Dahl wants further away. The referendum is just the most concrete disagreement, because what is the compromise between yes and no? The DF categorically refuses to advocate a yes vote in the EU election campaign.It is possible within the government to have each its own line, if you just agree to respect the result, says Kristian Thulesen Dahl."
" Thuringia's state leader Björn Höcke, for example, recently demanded in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, But many in the AfD's national leadership are sceptical about cooperation with the Front National. Le Pen, the party leader, has exorcised the party's open anti-Semitism. But unlike the AfD, it advocates the reintroduction of the death penalty and withdrawal from Nato."
" Thus, in ethical discussions, for example on abortion, but also in general on family policy, a unified line of the new right-wing faction is almost inconceivable. What then remains in common is a general rejection of Muslim immigration and criticism of further European communitarisation and the plethora of EU regulations. Express nationalism, however, would endanger the group. Especially since it is not particularly popular in the AfD's own country.This, however, is not what everyone in the AfD thinks."
" Thus, in the course of the permanent shift to the right, so many radical statements had accumulated by the end of 2018 that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution only needed to compile a collection of evidence in order to classify the völkisch wing around Björn Höcke as well as the youth organisation as suspicious cases and thus worry more bourgeois supporters. European politics weakened the AfD because internally a hard rejection of the EU was allowed to become an informal common sense. This was reflected in the election programme in the following sentence: ""If our fundamental reform approaches cannot be realised in the existing system of the EU within a reasonable period of time, we consider it necessary for Germany to leave. This Dexit option was hardly communicable during the election campaign because of the London Brexit chaos."
" Thus, the meeting of the MEPs of the PDL decided by Silvio Berlusconi for Friday, although planned for some time, is likely to turn into a chorus hostile to new criticism arrived yesterday by the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn. In fact, he promises to radicalize an electoral campaign played against the EU institutions: a way to rewrite with rosier shades the history of the end of his center-right government; to cement an alliance with the League that has been thundering against Brussels for a long time; and to put Mario Monti in trouble, pointing to him as the champion of an elitist and pro-German technocracy, against which to unload the unpopularity of the measures taken in the last year and a half. In short, it would become a consistent piece of the Knight's comeback attempt."

" Thus, the parliamentary group has left the issue of the euro rescue to the FDP. The motions of the Liberals and the AfD were quite similar: both aimed at defending the rights of national parliaments in the planned installation of a European Monetary Fund at EU level. However, because the Liberals argued in a more differentiated manner and were cleverer with interposed questions, the polarisation between FDP and GroKo occurred."
" Time changeover on the brink of extinction But in another sense, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is right: the biannual time change is seen by many as an imposition imposed from above, i.e. from Brussels, and thus fuels anti-EU sentiment. It is no coincidence that right-wing populists like the FPÖ are going all out on the issue. On the merits, many positions are defensible."
" To a less general question - whether European economic integration has strengthened their country's economy - Italians seem even angrier: only 9% answer yes, compared to 11% in 2013 and 22% in 2012 . In all other countries, including Greece, yeses are by far a higher percentage, up to 63% in Germany. The immediate result will probably be seen in next week's European elections: Italy could be the country where anti-EU votes - from M5S, the League, Fratelli d'Italia, partly Forza Italia - will be the highest share among all 28 of the EU. Patience: the European Union, after all, deserves a democratic scolding."
" To be influential, you have to be together,"" he argues. This perspective requires curbing the anti-European populism that thrives in the heart of Europe, according to Enrico Letta. For the FN, being excluded from the system is a privilege. He never takes any political responsibility,"" says the Italian."
" To be noted the EU Commissioner for the Economy Gentiloni who on Twitter urged to listen to Draghi. To express perplexity, while sharing the need for a new season of investment, is the leader of FdI Giorgia Meloni: From Draghi usual doses of uncritical Europeanism and a disturbing passage on a future EU Treasury Ministry. While Lega sources define Draghi's words as a rejection of the government and an earful of Europe..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
" To divert attention from the second wave and regain his melting support, he broke off negotiations with the EU on the post-Brexit relationship. Kaczynski, meanwhile, threatens the EU in an interview that if it does not leave the PiS government alone, it will block the new EU budget and reconstruction fund, from which Poland is to receive 160 billion euros.It is clear that Wlk."
" To her former ally in the presidential campaign, the FN president writes: I therefore propose that we meet as soon as possible in order to work on a common charter that will establish the priorities and essential measures to transform the European Union into a Europe of nations, cooperation and freedom. We have talked a lot in the last few months about the need to bring together national forces for the European elections. It is now necessary to reflect on the concretization of this gathering, explains Nicolas Bay, FN MEP and co-president of the ENL group in the European Parliament, to L'Obs. Everyone on this side of the political spectrum seems to agree that the time has come to come together in the face of Emmanuel Macron who is outpacing the other parties in the polls."
" To the challenges of economic recovery and political regeneration, the new government will have to add the defense of the European project and the new role that Spain can and must assume in order to consolidate and substantially reform this project. A government dominated or controlled by Podemos, if it were the case, would end up revealing its fundamental coincidence with Brexit, although in its electoral program it camouflages its position on the EU with a plan for the democratization of its institutions. The voter who goes to the polls tomorrow has increased his or her prospects in the same proportion as the political responsibility for his or her decision."
" To the from In principle, all opposition parties, from the Greens and the FPÖ to the Neos and Team Stronach, are in favour of breaking off the EU accession talks with Ankara.Caritas President Michael Landau warns that Austria and Europe are allowing themselves to be blackmailed by Turkey on the refugee issue."
" To this end, the FPÖ has for decades preferred to celebrate destructiveness as its main political business than to spend much time solving the country's problems. You don't have to cobble together a red catalogue of criteria for the city, the state (excluding Pannonia) and the federal government: A commitment of the FPÖ to the EU would remain a contradiction in terms, because Strache and Co. would like to declare everything that comes from Brussels null and void in this country with the help of plebiscites. A pledge to human rights, on the other hand, would be tantamount to a farce in a Western-style democracy like Austria."
" Today is expected the rating of Moody's.Opposition forces are preparing to give battle to the new executive. When there will be confidence we will be in the square with Fratelli d'Italia in the event convened by Giorgia Meloni, said the League leader Matteo Salvini,who added: the Conte-bis is the first Italian government that was born in Brussels. Against this government we will make opposition in parliament and in Italy, where we are the majority, with our mayors and governors."
" Today we must act together on migration policy, which is an existential problem for Europe and the survival of its cultures. Who will be part of the new parliamentary group in Strasbourg together with the League? We of the AfD certainly. Then the party of Marine Le Pen, the Dutch party of Geert Wilders, the Swedish Democrats, the Finnish Perus, all those parties that are against the excessive concentration of power in Brussels and want the return of national sovereignty.What about the Poles in the Pis?"
" Today, as in the past, the FPÖ is using conjured up alleged facts, mostly to be counted as fake news, to increase the uncertainty of the population in order to be able to successfully exploit these fears, which are to be taken seriously, for themselves without a real threat situation. In 1995, the referendum on Austria's accession to the European Union provided Haider with a new stage for propaganda of insecurity, and the FPÖ has maintained its anti-EU stance to this day. Social demagogy complemented the FPÖ's new course, and the party, and above all Haider himself, presented themselves as defenders of the industrious and hard-working, who would have to endure unjustified economic disadvantages. At the same time, the FPÖ pursued an economically liberal to neoliberal and thus business-friendly programme, then as now."
" Today, such a Forum would be impossible, while Islamophobia will become one of the major binders uniting almost all ECR parties. Brexit means that PiS had to start looking for allies who could replace the Tories as the main partner. Therefore, at the beginning of the year, Kaczynski's party began talks on cooperation with the Italian national-populist League, with which it was in one political group in the EP in 2004-09 (and Solidarna Polska in 2011-14)."
" Today, the only conventio ad excludendum (an agreement obviously not written and with a potential weight even on the Quirinal) could consist in a sort of examination of Europeanism to which some political forces should be submitted. However, the election campaign has shown that even the parties usually more ill-disposed towards the EU - such as the 5 Stars and the League - have toned down their criticism.For sure, however, the fact remains that at this stage the Colle does not intend to play any role."
" Together against each other ÖVP and FPÖ profit from confrontation, Kurz gives the SPÖ a run for its money T The ÖVP needs the FPÖ as a reliable partner in the government and as a reliable opponent in the EU election campaign. Without the FPÖ, which is now being stylised in well-dosed spurts as the bogeyman of conservative EU supporters, with their benevolent consent of course, the ÖVP would have a real mobilisation problem."
" Together, they would come to one-sixth of the 705 seats, compared to roughly one-tenth now. This is not to mention the Polish PiS and other Eastern European parties, which are currently working with the British Tories, and newcomers like the Dutch FvD. In short: in May 2019, a fifth of the Strasbourg seats are likely to go to anti-EU forces.Can they make a fist, influence legislation? Cooperation is a notorious weakness in these circles."
" Topic: the improvement of relations with Moscow and the lifting of sanctions against the Kremlin. AfD parliamentary group leader André Poggenburg (42) called the EU measures morally unacceptable in his speech, saying they only harmed the German economy. The starting point for the sanctions is the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which was against international law. Poggenburg claimed: Crimea was never annexed, it was the people's choice."
" Tria has repeatedly confirmed that the distance is by decimals. But, for now, Vice-Premiers Luigi Di Maio (M5S) and Matteo Salvini (Lega) defend the 2.4%. Instability in the financial markets with the Brussels-Rome clash may soften positions. The Bank of Italy has estimated the higher cost of interest on Italy's debt at 1.5 billion over the last six months, 5 billion next year and 9 billion in 2020. On the stock exchange, banks with BTPs in their portfolios were penalized."
" Trying to give the impression that we have not taken these challenges seriously. Notwithstanding that the Danish People's Party has for many years made it clear that EU enlargement with countries that are very far from Danish conditions could cause problems, as we see now. But I would urge the Prime Minister to stop spending time on it."
" Tsipras could have sought the votes of one of the other regenerative forces in Greek politics, such as the liberal centrists of To Potami, but he has preferred to pact with the Independent Greeks, a splinter group of New Democracy, the center-right party from which Samaras has governed Greece in recent years, which also articulates its demands to the EU under the label of the recovery of sovereignty. One of Tsipras' first decisions, after meeting with the Russian ambassador in Greece, who sent him a letter of congratulations from Putin, was to position himself against the adoption of new sanctions against Russia by the EU. Here we are not facing any surprise either: Syriza, as well as Podemos and the rest of the parties of the European left, have been systematically voting in favor of Russia and against Ukraine since May last year when they reached the European Parliament. Whether out of ideological prejudice, ignorance or pure ideological cynicism, Alexis Tsipras, Pablo Iglesias and company seem to be convinced that Vladimir Putin, a nationalist who governs with one of the most corrupt oligarchies on the planet, presides over a country with bleeding social inequalities, relies on the Orthodox Church and persecutes journalists, homosexuals and feminists, is a leftist."
" Two of them are dominated by Britons - the Conservatives (ECR) with the Tories and the EU-sceptic faction (EFDD) around Nigel Farage's Independence Party - but they will leave with Brexit in March 2019. This is precisely where Vilimsky sees the great opportunity for the right: There is an incredible amount of movement, he enthuses; in all these groups there are representatives who are very similar. We are discussing an association of all EU critics and sceptics,"" confirms the FPÖ politician.His goal: We want to become the second strongest parliamentary group, we want to have a say in the election of the EU Commission President , says Vilimsky."
" Ulrike Lunacek, a Green, warns of an undermining of the European Parliament if only the mandataries of the euro countries meet separately. The FPÖ, on the other hand, rejects a Euro-Parliament because it is only supposed to rubber-stamp the undemocratic actions of the EU establishment that are not covered by the EU treaties. She wants to upgrade the Euro Group of Finance Ministers."
" Undersecretary Michele Geraci (Economic Development), who weaves relations with China, had already criticized this project in recent months. But despite Italy's reservations, the new rules have been definitively adopted by the EU (the Parliament had also approved them a month ago, again with the abstention of Lega and M5S).The Strasbourg voteAlso today, the China issue will end up in the Europarliamentary Chamber, although for a specific issue. The chamber will discuss security threats related to China's technological presence in the EU."
" Unfortunately, it is serious. It should also be a bad joke that no parties in Denmark have as much support in the opinion polls as the two that are against the EU - that is, Enhedslisten and the Danish People's Party.A lack of international solidarity like this is hard to find. SIGNATURE If Ukraine were part of the EU and NATO, Putin wouldn't be sending hooded elite soldiers into the country."
" Unlike the Tories in Britain, there are no internal splits within the parties here on the issue. Sinn Féin is the only bigger party with a lingering suspicion of the EU even though it is campaigning for a Remain vote.Here is how the parties stand on the issue before polling day tomorrow."
" Unlike under Red-Blue, Black-Blue I and Black-Blue II, the party leadership does not even allow the slightest opposition to the government. The more brashly the FPÖ's supporters can rail against the lack of security efforts at the EU level and the excessive EU bureaucracy: Who would not be against excessive bureaucracy? Exactly. Of course, neither does Chancellor Sebastian Kurz."
" Until now. Last Thursday, in a session of the Committee on Freedoms of the European Parliament in which the authoritarian drift of the Hungarian Viktor Orban, whose new legislation allows him to rule by decree indefinitely, was debated, Vox MEP Jorge Buxadé criticized the double yardstick of the EU for attacking that government, which the ultra party holds up as a model, and not that of Pedro Sánchez which, in addition to imposing censorship and letting the elderly die, would have subjected the Spanish population to a forced confinement that violates freedoms.Last Saturday, in an interview with a Youtube channel, the president of the party, Santiago Abascal, assured that the Government has taken this confinement too far with its political will to keep Spaniards locked up at home and questioned the legality of the fines imposed on those who do not comply."

" Until recently the League was doing 4% and today it is in government, this encourages us. I find this situation exciting because the next European elections could be a real earthquake: a Eurosceptic majority in Strasbourg could decree the end of this mad race of the European Union.In Italy, the League has allied itself with the Five Stars to go into government, why don't you ally yourself with Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the anti-system left? Meanwhile, let's be honest, there is a huge difference between the Five Stars and Mélenchon: the Italian movement is not in favor of unbridled immigration."
" Up to this point, the beautiful part of the story. Some people do not like the fact that the anti-EU Alternative for Germany (AfD) recognised the Desiderius Erasmus Association as a party-affiliated foundation at its national party conference in July. At the weekend, the Desiderius Erasmus Foundation held its first public meeting in Berlin."
" Uri Rosenthal, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, was more or less on this line when he received the 10 Eastern European ambassadors who had come to protest, and before that had signed a collective letter: the Prov is certainly not the government and does not represent its positions, he said, that site is its exclusive responsibility. There has also been some attempt at imitation elsewhere: in Italy, a similar site is announced by the Padan volunteers of the Northern League, on the behavior of non-EU citizens. The blond hair of Geert Wilders is certainly not new, in certain polemical dances: a few months ago, the MP preached the establishment of separate villages for the foam of society. And he is not always the only one to manifest certain moods on his side: not long ago the Polish government defined as dangerous a project attributed to the Minister of Social Affairs, Henk Kamp, for the deportation of unemployed Polish immigrants who do not speak Dutch."
" VVD and CDA sputter some resistance but are so entwined with big business interests that they support the current, neoliberal Europe almost without question. Right-wing populists like PVV and FVD do oppose the transfer of sovereignty from The Hague to Brussels, but mainly for cultural reasons (mass migration). A choice for these parties is therefore, consciously or not, a choice for big business and against citizens, animals and nature."
" VVD leader Wilders also took the same line against a European superstate: he also wants to abolish the euro. FPÖ Secretary General and MEP Harald Vilimsky, who led the formation of the parliamentary group with Le Pen, was more cautious about the euro: ""I would like to have a referendum"", he said, ""alternatives to the euro should be considered"". The first attempt to form a parliamentary group immediately after the EU elections in May 2014 had failed. Le Pen would have managed the minimum number of MEPs 25 with the FN alone, but not the number of countries they come from: According to the EP statute, MEPs must come from at least seven countries."
" Van der Bellen considers blowing up the European Union to be the biggest mistake one could ever make - politically and economically. Austria needs the EU, transnational cooperation is important. Parties like the FPÖ, which are concerned with Austria's diminishment, are not expedient, he said. In any case, one should not fear the worst, Van der Bellen said, hoping that the Austrians would be wise enough not to advocate a distortion of the individual states of Europe."
" Vice versa in Italy something different happens. I do not believe that political forces so conditioned by the extremes can make more radically innovative policies, he objects, explaining the reasons for his rise in politics, namely, the fact that the PDL has moved closer to the League and critical of the EU and the PD is interested, not wanting to have opponents on his left, to tie with Sel.Plead Years"
" Vice-President of the European Parliament. Sits in the conservative anti-EU ECR group along with the Danish People's Party, among others. He was elected for the Polish ruling party PiS. VISIONS EU CELEBRATES 60TH BIRTHDAY AND LAUNCHES DEBATE ON EU AFTER BREXIT."
" Vienna. The strategists at FPÖ headquarters planned things differently: Even before FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache could present his party's posters for the EU elections on Tuesday, he had to go out for damage limitation and announce a resignation: The deputy mayor of Braunau, Christian Schilcher, who caused a stir with a rat poem, resigns from office and leaves the Freedom Party.Er has literally reached into the political rubbish, Strache said of the liberal local politician who had packed racist content into a poem about rats with a sewer background."
" Vilimsky can imagine becoming EU Commissioner Order. After SPÖ, FPÖ also lays claim.Vienna."
" Vilimsky did not want to specify. There was also a problem of specification yesterday regarding the FPÖ's position on the EU in general and Austrian EU membership in particular. According to Vilimsky, the Freedom Party has at no time and under no circumstances advocated an Öxit - that is, Austria's exit from the EU - because the FPÖ is known to be the first pro-European party in the country."
" Vilimsky in favour of halving the EU Parliament The FPÖ Head of Delegation in the EU Parliament, Harald Vilimsky, has spoken out in favour of halving the number of European mandataries. Moreover, MEPs should be delegated by the domestic parliaments."
" Vilimsky should succeed in picking up the core voters. And as the biggest EU critic among the top EU candidates, he also has a Unique Selling Proposition. The FPÖ would probably prefer the term unique selling proposition. With Claudia Gamon, the only woman among the top candidates, the Neos present themselves as the most EU-friendly party."
" Vilimsky wants to turn that around: The others should no longer be able to get past a new, somewhat more moderate right-wing faction. The FPÖ man wants to have a say and hopes for a parliamentary group strength of more than 100 MEPs as the third strongest group just behind the Social Democrats.There is a new name for it again: Alliance of European Peoples and Nations is now the name of the electoral alliance for the EU elections, which reportedly plans to form in Milan on Monday."
" Vilimsky's statements were a pure diversionary manoeuvre with which he wanted to hide the fact that the Freedom Party was in a divided situation in its European policy. In Vienna, they are coalition partners in this respect and are bound by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. But in the European Parliament, the FPÖ members of the ENF group continue to oppose common European solutions. They even vote in the Group against things they advocate in Austria, such as stronger protection of the EU's external borders by Frontex , explains Karas."
" Vilimsky, an experienced campaign manager, dismissed any idea that his delegation might leave the ENF. The FPÖ was only critical of the EU, there was no factionalism.On the contrary, he announced unequivocally that he and his fellow campaigners were aiming to set up an even broader right-wing group from the existing three anti-EU groups after the European elections in May 2019."
 Vilimsky: FPÖ was the first European party The FPÖ candidate wants a leaner EU - without Turkey.Vienna.
" Vladimir Putin is certainly not interested in Austrian political dynamics but in their repercussions on Europe. What was casually revealed in Austria confirms Russian activism towards European countries: there was talk of Russia's help to Brexit proponents, support for sovereignist and anti-European parties in Eastern Europe, an interest in Marine Le Pen's Front National and Matteo Salvini's League. Beyond the inferences, it is undoubtedly possible to glimpse a Russian strategy towards Europe with the aim of avoiding the emergence of a political-economic bloc (which adheres to NATO) at the borders of Putin's empire."
" Wasn't that a provocation?. Steen Flemming Jørgensen, Vester Søgade 78, Copenhagen: As a very big EU critic I cannot find my political stand in the election 29.5. The whole Folketing is for EU except DF & EL. Enhedslisten does not run as a party, but joins the People's Movement against the EU, here the leading candidate is a communist and member of the national leadership of the Danish Communist Party, I do not want to vote for them, what do I do? Do I have to compromise so much that the DF gets my vote on the 29th?"
" We are all well aware that it has to be done very carefully. The Prime Minister has his say on the anti-EU demonstration of the League, making it clear that he does not like certain tones, while he is engaged in a difficult dialogue in Europe: the event falls within the physiology of the dialectic of political debate. But the fact remains that, as President of the Council, I interact with the European institutions, I sit at the table with them and I characterize the tone of the interlocution with them, with whom I started a constructive dialogue.The League brakes, in the afternoon comes an unofficial note in which it ensures that there is no intention to block the citizenship income."
" We are as far from Russia as any EU country and have a long history of free-riding on our neighbours for security. The question some people pose is: why join in if you can get the benefits without joining? For others, including Sinn Féin and some Independent MEPs, opposition to more EU security co-operation is partly motivated by a curious sympathy towards Russia.In the wake of the invasion of Crimea, the European Parliament voted in favour of a resolution condemning the invasion and the human rights abuses that followed."
" We are facing a Marxism-Leninism recycled by the latest media, but as convinced as the Lenin who said: The bourgeois will sell us even the rope to hang them. Change bourgeois for caste and sell for give away, and you will have Syriza, Podemos and the like. As if all this were not enough, the EU is left with an even more serious blackmail: that of the English who, in order to remain in the Union, demand special conditions and obligations à la carte. Like the Greeks, but admitting it."
" We are just witnessing the beginning of the post-lexit. PiS, however, does not want to leave the EU. His politicians keep saying that."
" We are now in the right place at the right historical moment. Spain needs a profound change, but there are many sensible people who do not want to throw overboard what has been done in the Transition in this country: the Constitution, the Welfare State, the market economy and the European Union. As opposed to Podemos, which proposes a rupture with everything, we want a constitutional pact, with a regulated market economy and a Welfare State. From Ciudadanos we want justice, while Podemos wants revenge."
" We are working, by April there is an economic maneuver to be prepared. I read that Brussels wants new taxes, we will make an alternative and contrary maneuver: less taxes, and everyone will be happy because Italy will grow more, said yesterday the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini.That Brussels is monitoring our accounts very carefully is obvious, but so far no one has yet asked Rome for a corrective action. At Treasury, where papers are being prepared for presentation in Parliament, there is confidence in this regard."
" We can do that at the moment because we are one market. How much we could do that in a Brexit scenario is questionable, she said. Earlier, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness launched Sinn Féin's remain campaign Put Ireland First at the Europa Hotel in Belfast.Ireland's place North and South is leading change in Europe, he said."
" We can easily avoid such a catastrophe in Europe. The AfD, PVV or UKIP raise issues but offer no solutions - see the chaos around Brexit. The remaining 80 to 90 percent need to take those problems seriously, but come up with their own solutions and propagate them confidently."
" We can't do without the trade it brings, not outside its internal market and not outside its security guarantees. With that statement Minister Frans Timmermans (European Affairs) opposes the PVV idea that the Netherlands should leave the European Union. ,,A nonsensical thought."
" We disagree on some things, says Kolm. As, for example, with the abolition of the Hackler regulation. She wants it, the FPÖ does not. Or: The FPÖ's head of delegation in the EU Parliament, Andreas Mölzer, is in favour of a financial transaction tax in principle. Condition: It should only not be the nucleus of an EU tax."
" We don't have a deal, we have discussions, she said. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy has called on the Irish government to block a new EU-Canada trade deal.The deal was finalised last year but needs the seal of approval of parliaments in the EU's 28 Member States."
 We don't live in a monarchy. Will the FPÖ commit to the EU in a government programme?We are fully committed to a European peace project.
" We don't want to put a deadline on ourselves that could derail a roadmap, he said. The roadmap, at least theirs, involves agreeing their position on issues such as the spending ceiling of the General State Budget; pensions; the amount of the dependent child allowance (in their opinion, it should reach 100 euros per month); CETA, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada that Podemos wants to appeal to the Constitutional Court; the repeal of the 2012 labor reform, and the Minimum Interprofessional Wage (to consolidate a 7% increase per year). I think there may be a PSOE closer to Unidos Podemos than to the PP, Iglesias concluded."
 We have a responsibility to the state and cannot afford such escapades to the detriment of Austria. The FPÖ is deliberately acting against EU policy in the Balkans. This also counts against their own foreign minister in the Balkans.
" We have agreed that European law applies 100 per cent, said Chancellor-designate Sebastian Kurz at the presentation of the government programme. He wrested a commitment to the EU and the euro from the FPÖ. The fact that Austria remains an integral part of the European Union and the common currency, the euro, does not require the Freedom Party to make any major substantive changes."
 We have always said that we want to change the EU from within. EU candidate Petra Steger said in 2013 about a euro exit: The FPÖ is in favour of the possibility to discuss alternatives - be it another currency or back to the schilling.The discussion about an Öxit is clearly not taking place in our country.
" We have not succeeded, but we had to try, the Spaniard said.The diplomatic mission, however, has generated a striking controversy in Brussels. The European People's Party, Renew Europe (which includes Ciudadanos) or ECR (European Conservatives and Reformists, where Vox is) call the mission clandestine, accuse Borrell of going on his own, of breaking the EU position on the issue and of trying to negotiate with a communist narcodictatorship. A battery of attacks for pretending to whitewash Maduro and in which they have reproached him (Leopoldo López, PP deputy and father of the opposition leader who is a refugee in the Spanish embassy in Caracas) that they would not do something similar if it were, for example, Belarus."
" We have rural discourse. We can tell the people in the countryside that the EU is good for them, as opposed to those of Vox who criticize it, a deputy prepares himself. Now we all have to go back to talking about bulls, hunting, traditional festivities, issues that seemed to have been overcome in the campaigns because they are not under discussion in our lands, those are things of Madrid, a socialist territorial leader is indignant."
 We have set ourselves an ambitious programme for the Presidency and will strive to serve the European Union during this time. Also no concerns about the FPÖ protesting loudly against the EU?I have the feeling that all ministers in the Federal Government are preparing professionally for the Council Presidency.
" We leave that kind of ideological wreckage to the Greens. But the DF has a problem with the fact that the proposal for new EU patents creates access for extensive forum shopping, just as we insist that the transfer of sovereignty is decided by the people. Under the new proposal, EU patent litigation would be decided by national courts as a first instance."
 We must choose carefully. Sinn Féin is still an ; ; unlikely Europhile. It ; ; urged a 'No' in every ; ; one of the nine EU ; ; referendums in the ; ; Republic from 1973 ; ; until 2012 ;
" We need to strengthen national states and reduce the competences of the EU, announced KaczyÄ±ski. These words should be understood as the Polish contribution to the discussion about the future of the EU after Brexit. PiS believes that it was not Brussels' omnipotence that caused the British to decide to leave the EU. That's why he wants the EU's competences diluted."
" We no longer measure ourselves almost exclusively against Britain. Third, euroscepticism in Ireland, insofar as it exists, was long led by Sinn Féin and extreme Irish nationalism of a kind similar to the English nationalism that drove the Brexit project. Those who favour the European project are generally against extreme nationalism of any kind."
" We question the realism of the free movement of people from member states that are very far from the EU average. But everyone immediately says that EU agreements are sacred and good.In the European corridors, the PVV is not challenged on its positions, Zijlstra says. People ignore us for as long as possible."
" We see a similar debate not only in the UK, but also in Germany and many other countries, she says. The debate on EU citizens' access to welfare benefits is running in so many countries that it could lead to new rules in this area, says EU expert.The demand for a welfare reservation is being put forward by the Danish People's Party in the run-up to the EP elections on Sunday.Danish People's Party's leading candidate, Morten Messerschmidt, justifies it by saying that Danish voters have been assured in every referendum since 1972 that the EU would not interfere in Danish welfare services."
" We should therefore have an honest discussion about where we are heading if we think Kickl's considerations through to the end. Since the Convention is also the basis for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and serves as a guideline for the European Court of Justice, at the end of the day there would be only one possibility left to no longer be subject to it: withdrawal from the EU, i.e. Öxit. But the FPÖ does not want to talk about that. That is why Kickl now claims never to have questioned the ECHR, although of course he did exactly that (as, incidentally, did FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache before)."
" We should therefore have an honest discussion about where we are heading if we think Kickl's thoughts on the Human Rights Convention through to the end. Since the Convention is also the basis for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and serves as a guideline for the European Court of Justice, at the end of the day there would be only one possibility left to no longer be subject to it: leaving the EU, i.e. Öxit. This should be pointed out at every opportunity.D-The FPÖ, however, does not like to talk about this, because for years a large majority of Austrians have been in favour of remaining in the Union. Especially since the chaos surrounding Brexit, no one is seriously thinking about an Öxit."
" We start there and end with monetary sovereignty. This is the new image of the FN, which is constantly searching for its position on Europe. A goal, a spin or a turnaround to make the next European elections a catalyst."
 We want to free up these resources. How will you find a shared line with the League if you are on opposite sides in the EU? The diversity at the European level between M5S and the League is not an anomaly.
" We will all pay for PiS's war with the European Union. - stated Malgorzata Tracz, Green Party MP. PiS is leading Poland into a post-lexitic downward spiral. It has no idea how to build anything in the EU, so in the situation of weakening ratings it relies on conflict to activate the electorate. Now he is going to tell us that the Commission is guilty of fining us."
" We will keep him, says Thulesen Dahl. With the referendum on the legal reservation on Thursday, the Danish People's Party sees a chance to push Lars Løkke Rasmussen in a more EU critical direction. In the event of a no or a narrow yes, it would be natural for the prime minister to call for negotiations on a new European political agreement that includes the no parties, says the DF president."
" We will not allow ourselves to be pushed out of the EU, reiterate prominent PiS politicians. What is the point if the EU does not intend to expel Poland? Well, the point is that in the next few months we will be told that the EU's defence of the Polish rule of law and the 'money for rule of law' mechanism will, against the will of Law and Justice, lead us out of the EU. And if Poles swallow such a message, Kaczynski will be able to say: I do not want Polexit, but it is the Union that is breaking with Poland, and we are reacting with pain."
" We will not get out of it by ourselves either, because contrary to popular opinion PiS knows that Poland gains a lot from its membership in the EU (The thing is that Brussels will never agree to such a thing. Especially after Brexit, when EU cohesion is one of the top priorities. And there is one reliable means of pressure on the Polish side, the Polish prime minister and the chairman of the Law and Justice party, which Prof. Anthony Dudek."
" We will sit at the table for a fair dialogue and a constructive and calm confrontation. Above all, the Prime Minister also wanted Salvini and Di Maio to say clear words: There is and will be no intention to leave the EU and the single currency, said the League leader. And Di Maio added: As long as I remain M5s political leader, there will be no will on our part either to leave the eurozone or to leave the EU."
" We'll fight it at home and abroad and in the courts, Mr Noonan said belligerently. The Finance Minister's tone was in marked contrast with his public utterances in 2011-12 when Ireland's hand was in the EU bailout dog's mouth.But Mr Noonan's shift in emphasis was well topped by Sinn Féin, which had solidly called No in nine consecutive EU referendum campaigns from 1972 until 2012. Now, in what must surely be the most contentious call ever by the EU authorities involving Ireland, Sinn Féin goes all pro-Brussels.This is not about the EU trying to encroach on our tax sovereignty."
" We'll just have a referendum that's all about that. Is it true that a no vote will result in more refugees to Denmark? Yes, according to various experts, in that situation we could lose the right to send refugees back to other EU countries where they are registered.--But that is not exactly what the DF wants? No.What will they do about it? Then they will have a referendum on a new special treaty for Denmark."
" We're socialists, he emphasised. It has also emerged that the grouping could have problems with Sinn Féin over EU policies. It wants a referendum on any EU-US transatlantic trade deal."
" Weber wants to cut funds from EU enemies AfD and Le Pen's party to go empty-handed in future BrusselsBang from Brussels: The leading candidate of the European People's Party (EPP), Manfred Weber (CSU), demands that parties working against the goals of the European Union (EU) should no longer receive financial support from the EU budget."
 Weidel is also against the communitisation of state financing by the European Central Bank. A further element of an EU change in the AfD's sense should be that the elected national parliaments should be given the right to veto Brussels' guidelines. And secondly - if the national parliaments cannot get their way - that they can then deviate from EU requirements.
" Well past the halfway mark of the cacophonous hour, Kelder briefly took the initiative. He held up a book by Baudet and asked what he meant by an intelligent exit from the European Union.At last Hertzberger named the elephant in the studio: the anti-Semitism within FvD and Baudet's statement that almost everyone he knew was an anti-Semite. Kelder urged Baudet to answer, but quickly in view of time."
" Were the values previously present in the FPÖ? The values are being played against the wall by the current fun party, which is now in charge in the FPÖ.What do you want to achieve with your candidacy in the EU?We want to go back to the time before the Maastricht Treaty."
" What did Nicolas Bay, co-chairman of the Europe of Nations and Liberties group and former secretary general of the RN, and Younous Omarjee, a member of the LFI, vote against? Against! In the National Assembly, not to be outdone, it was with great enthusiasm that the deputy Louis Aliot (RN), whose name is mentioned in the media as head of the RN list for the European elections, had supported last autumn the proposal of La France insoumise to remove the European flag from the hemicycle of the Palais-Bourbon. Finally, it is striking how closely Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Marine Le Pen defend the idea that France should be closer to Russia than to its European Union partners."
" What is fixed is that with Karas, the ÖVP is fully committed to actively shaping Europe instead of sabotaging the work of the EU with populist prophecies of doom, as ÖVP Secretary General Gernot Blümel puts it. This is a declaration of war against the FPÖ. However, the ÖVP is not only addressing the EU supporters, but will also try to convince its members to vote on 25 October. May to mobilise."
" What is new is the opposition coalition, which was forged at very short notice on Wednesday. This time, those involved have chosen even more powerful opponents: the USA and the EU. The FPÖ, the Greens and the BZÖ see the latest developments in the Snowden case, which forced Colombian President Evo Morales to land in Austria, as an indictment of the EU. In separate statements on Wednesday, all three called on the Austrian government to show its colours vis-à-vis the USA in the wiretapping affair and to advocate for such a procedure in the EU."
" What is new is the opposition coalition, which was forged on Wednesday at very short notice. This time, those involved have chosen even more powerful opponents: the USA and the EU. The FPÖ, the Greens and the BZÖ see the latest developments in the Snowden case, which forced Bolivia's Evo Morales to land in Austria, as an indictment of the EU. In separate statements on Wednesday, all three called on the Austrian government to show its colours vis-à-vis the USA in the wiretapping affair and to advocate for such a procedure in the EU."
" What nonsense, Meuthen said. Weber as Commission President would be a disaster for the EU and for Europe as a whole. He urged the EPP leadership candidate to read the AfD party programme. It clearly states that we want to reform the EU at its core, but not abolish it,"" explained the AfD leader, who is a member of the European Parliament in Brussels."
" What prevails is a controversy born of short-sighted electoral calculations, which ends up weakening not one majority or the other but Italy as such. Also because it is mandatory to ask whether the difficulties of today's executive are not daughters of the European isolation lapped by the precedent between M5S and Lega. Euroscepticism has long clogged communications with Brussels. Now the reports have resumed."
" What speaks in favour of apprenticeships and jobs before the decision to stay EU Directive explicitly allows vocational training for asylum seekers EU Reception Directive explicitly allows vocational training for asylum seekers and requires effective labour market access Implementation in most other EU states more liberal than in Austria Experts complain about restrictions F for Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, the inclusion of young asylum seekers in apprenticeship training for shortage occupations is simply wrong. If someone does not have the right to stay, he should not be allowed to start an apprenticeship, argues the FPÖ party leader. However, it is questionable whether he is doing justice to the current EU regulations, which place a high value on asylum seekers quickly acquiring professional skills and working in a job. Specifically, the EU Reception Directive, which had to be implemented across the Union by July 2015, explicitly allows member states to provide access to vocational training for protection seekers during the procedure."
" What to do, as it is called in the common language of the Union, ' euroglobish'. THE MOST common European feature of the general election was the rise of protest parties in a number of countries: Jobbik in Hungary, Ubik in Britain, Syriza in Greece, Front National in France and the Danish People's Party in Denmark. Soon the EU will have a new Commission President who is completely known in the EU and completely unknown in 'Alas, Europe!There has been no shortage of commentators who have spotted and interpreted the paradox of this pan-European EU scepticism."
 What we are currently witnessing is an attempt to reverse the outcome of a democratic decision. The AfD sees only the EU as obliged to accommodate the British. It is a sign of a lack of sovereignty to behave like the EU in a separation.
" What will small parties like the League do at this point?A. I don't know what the Northern League will do, given the neo-fascist twist it has taken because of its relationship with Marine Le Pen; furthermore, I don't know how Forza Italia, which in Europe is part of the pro-European Ppe, can get along with Mrs. Le Pen's anti-EU allied League. Berlusconi comes out weakened."
" When asked to take a look at the Front National's programme, she sends us several points of disagreement:"" The idea of dividing the flow of immigration by twenty in five years seems to me absolutely extravagant. This implies getting out, not only of the euro as the Front National proposes, but of the European Union which ensures through the European Court of Justice that migrants' rights are respected. """" The National Front decrees that assimilation is still possible."
" When he went to Germany after a conviction for causing public nuisance (completely ridiculous from today's perspective), he called it an escape. When he was asked now, 50 years later: How do you experience the country (meaning Austria) today? he also answered with the cipher of exile: If it comes to it that we leave the EU, I will become an exile again on the spot. He has nothing to fear. Not even the FPÖ wants that. Of course, this does not change anything about Brus' artistic rank."
" When it comes to the immigration of foreign workers, the positions are less far apart than it might seem at first glance. The SPÖ, driven by the trade union federation and the Chamber of Labour, is in favour of making full use of the transitional periods in the EU for opening the labour market to workers in the new EU states in Eastern Europe. The FPÖ is against a further opening of the labour market. The background for this lockstep is clear: Especially when it comes to measures against cheap labour, Red and Blue are fighting particularly doggedly among workers largely in the same electorate."
" When was the last time there was such a clear commitment by two top Austrian politicians since EU accession in 1995? When Kurz saw him beaming overjoyed between Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, with Donald Tusk and Juncker, one could almost forget that he is in a coalition with the EU-sceptics of the FPÖ. It cozies up with glee to EU enemies like Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen, who want to weaken the open Union."
" Where is all this leading to? The politicians don't care; they won't be affected. I'm amazed Sinn Féin hasn't seen the opening for an anti-EU stance, or that we don't have new party that could lead us out of the EU.JERRY LONG, address supplied."
" Where the DF was for the social assistance ceiling, the integration benefit and the agricultural package, the S was against. In addition, the two parties disagree strongly on the issue of EU membership. And although the S has recently adopted a stricter policy on foreigners, the DF will often go further.0"
" Whereas in the previous year he had spoken about a wind of hope, his world view has now darkened considerably: a wind of madness is sweeping over the world. In Guterres, Schallenberg found an interlocutor who was informed about the environmental policy of the Turkish-Green coalition in Vienna - and who, in view of the increasingly autocratic tendencies, would like to have a strong EU as a partner, as the Foreign Minister summed up his conversation. The rejection of the migration pact pushed by the FPÖ and adopted by the new government, on the other hand, had not come up for discussion.The Minister touted Austria as the spearhead of disarmament."
" Which everyone is well aware of in this government that contains at least two governments, and a majority from which its potential opposition is also deduced: if Salvini does not put a brake on his anti-EU boldness, Luigi Di Maio might feel entitled to do the same. M5S sources explain that the hard-nosed attack against Mario Draghi has cost a lot of criticism to the political leader, who out of respect for the requests of Conte had decided to mitigate the rough dialectic with the EU. Also because the League and Salvini had left him alone in the field to fight a battle already lost against the president of the European Central Bank. Yesterday's call to the square, however, could wipe out the brief Cricket truce."
" Which grows when the CEO of IntesaSanpaolo, Carlo Messina, calls for debt reduction through extraordinary operations. And the publisher Azzurra Caltagirone claims the EU approval of the copyright directive, opposed by the League. Salvini vanishes."
" Which, according to Istat, will barely reach 1.2% this year and 1% in 2019.Brussels: be carefulNeedless to mention that the government's major reforms (citizenship income, flat tax and pension reform), despite a few tweaks on the run, require more. For this reason, 5 Stelle and Lega continue to press Tria and raise the tone with the EU. We will be constructive in the discussions on the budget, despite the tone in some cases unkind to us - said Commissioner Moscovici -."
" While Kurz adheres to decisions of all EU governments on the issue of Russia sanctions and speaks only of a gradual lifting as soon as the conflict in eastern Ukraine is resolved, the FPÖ leadership demands a rapid lifting. FPÖ serves other groups of voters. One reason for the clearly different attitudes towards the EU is, of course, the respective electorates of the ÖVP and the FPÖ."
" While Söder and Dobrindt were competing in Munich for the best starting position for the post-Seehofer era, Weber was rising in Brussels without his party colleagues really noticing. In retrospect, the 2014 European election campaign appears to be a turning point. At the time, Seehofer was the undisputed party leader, brought Peter Gauweiler to his side and led the CSU on a decidedly anti-EU course in the hope of taking the wind out of the sails of the AfD, which was contesting for the first time. At that time, many say today, the CSU lost its orientation."
" While for the Greens it tipped more into the folkloristic, it could change the nature of the FPÖ more clearly. And it would be quite desirable if the FPÖ were serious: with a clearer commitment to the EU - after all, at the time it was the first party to campaign for accession to the EC before Jörg Haider tried to use the opposition for his own purposes.And also with the renunciation of anti-Semitism, to which at least the party leadership has been committed for years."
" While he praises the fantastic economic expertise of Lücke's team. But he also has to live with Lucke forging spontaneous alliances with extreme opponents of Europe like Ukip.The AfD is also forcing the parliamentary group onto a new course of confrontation on the euro. In the past, you could keep a low profile here."
" While in Spain no government pact has been reached so far, although only two and a half weeks have elapsed since the elections, in Portugal an unprecedented alliance between three left-wing parties was formed after the legislative elections of October 4, which ousted the most voted coalition, the center-right group led by former Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. . The moderates of the PS, Costa's party, joined forces with the Left Bloc (the 'sister' formation in the European Union of Podemos and Syriza) and with the orthodox Communist Party, Eurosceptic forces with which it has agreed to cancel the cuts of the 2011-2014 period.0"
" While the 2006 election pamphlet still talked about referendums on European affairs, since the last elections Europe has been on the PVV's books as an exponent of a left-wing multiculturalism with which the Netherlands must break away. 'Thanks to the club in Brussels, Europe is rapidly becoming Eurabia,' warns the two-year-old party program. The PVV remedy: 'The Netherlands should immediately disregard all decisions made by Brussels in the area of mass immigration.' Even better: abolish that entire European Parliament.That was in 2010."
" While the government proposes further challenges to international conventions, it will not jump out of them. In relation to the EU, the DF is flirting with a withdrawal if, after the British referendum on Thursday next week, a new opportunity for a loose affiliation arises. This in turn has increased the distance between the two parties."
" Who I will vote for in the election, I will let it depend on the program. I think it's very important to be able to vote for a party that also opposes mass immigration, the rise in power of the European Union and climate hysteria, and that can still be Forum for Democracy.'I'll probably vote for the PVV now'"
" Who makes unnatural alliances, when the latter supports the policies of New Democracy? But then, why not in France? The idea is reminiscent of Eric Zemmour's ridiculous position that the FN and the Front de Gauche should join forces to defend the French nation against the European Union; here again, I would remind you that Anel's line and history are far, far from those of the FN...A more relevant comparison is perhaps with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan's formation, Debout la France, and he did not hesitate to welcome the alliance, declaring that he would be ready to do the same with Jean-Luc Mélenchon ""if it is to save France""."
" Who this week expressed the desire for our country to leave the EU. Leader PVV in Brussels happy with anti-EU position Wilders Madlener (43) is very pleased that his party leader has once again thrown the cudgel into the fire. And a farewell to Brussels is achievable, says the comrade of PVV leader Wilders."
" Wilders did not get enough support in the House of Representatives for postponement until after the elections and will argue in court that the outgoing cabinet is guilty of an unlawful act by not waiting for the verdict of the voters. This remarkable extra-parliamentary act is entirely in line with the PVV's efforts to make the euro and EU membership the stake of the ballot box. Participation in the emergency fund, according to Wilders, leads to a transfer of sovereignty."
" Wilders rails against the elite of the secularized Netherlands. After sixty years of peace and prosperity, the renewed nationalism of the PVV is directed against the EU (Weg ermee!). Stegman does the same, but in reverse: after the debacle of the Second World War and the loss of the Dutch East Indies, she wants to get rid of the Netherlands and its pillarization (Weg ermee!), which must be absorbed into Europe."
 Will not make it to autumn elections yet Standard: The head of the documentation archive has formulated an interesting observation: The FPÖ is increasingly narrowing its focus to anti-foreigners and anti-EU. Is that a reason for the FP's relegation? Mölzer:
" Will that soon translate into real political power? text Christoph Schmidt The elections for the European Parliament are only more than half a year away, but in the (social) media there is already an unprecedented election fever. The spotlight is on populist, Eurosceptic parties, such as the PVV in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip) in Britain and the Front National (FN) in France. They might just get the most votes in their country."
" Will the populists win?R. The populists are in retreat, the Brexit has failed, Theresa May's deal will not pass. Even the League I think will have backlash but will hold up quite well because it has an electorate that has consolidated over time and is expanding in the South. Unlike the Movimento5stelle.D."
" With Austrian tax money we are obviously allowed to help Italians, Spaniards or French, but not Austrian companies, he ranted indignantly in the direction of the EU Commission and its representative in Vienna, Martin Selmayr. The criticism of the EU may appeal to the politically homeless former Viennese FPÖ voters whom Blümel is targeting with these statements. But not everyone in the Vienna ÖVP likes it."
" With Rutte, the liberals have brought in a left-wing wolf in sheep's clothing, who is selling out liberal ideology to left-wing autocratic EU politics. The only parties that fight for their own country and sovereignty and oppose the dictatorial EU and its open borders policy are PVV and FvD. Let's hope that common sense will break through among the liberals among Rutte's supporters and that they will oppose the VVD's sell-out to the left."
" With charismatic Nigel Farage at the helm, the party became the big winner of the UK election. But now Farage may have to wipe the smile off his face. EP CHOICE Former friends and fierce opponents criticise DF for group shift in EU.In place of the EFD, the 605,889 votes cast for the Danish People's Party in the EP elections over the next five years will be translated into policy through membership of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group."
" With clear language on certain aspects such as the fight against austerity, but very confused when it comes to the euro, the principles of the single market and national borders, Syriza's natural allies are the parties of the radical left but also those of the extreme nationalist right, who dream of doing away with the single currency. In this plan aimed at demolishing the European Union as we know it today, the main ally of the Greek populists is Podemos. In Athens they dream that a no victory would give Pablo Iglesias wings in Spain, because with a country that is four times bigger than Greece they could reach a critical mass to carry out their plans."
" With fear and trembling, Europhiles await the European elections later this month. It looks like parties that don't like the whole European project, such as Geert Wilders' PVV and Marine Le Pen's Front National, will win a resounding victory. Perhaps the greatest Europhile or Europhile is Guy Verhofstadt, former Prime Minister of Belgium, frontrunner of the European Liberals in the European Parliament, candidate for the presidency of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, and quite a hothead."
" With five days to go before the elections, the president of the Front movement attacked ""international finance and speculators"", so as not to leave this slogan to François Hollande or Jean-Luc Mélenchon. In Marseille, the theme was not chosen by chance: ""We often tend to talk about immigration and insecurity in Marseille, but I think that the second aspect of the plundering of the French, in the context of these European elections, is also the whole budgetary policy"", explained the FN president, according to whom ""the European Union created the crisis and is now trying to make the people pay for it"".Less vehement, less energetic than in the past, but still passionate, Jean-Marie Le Pen has spared no effort in this campaign."
" With the August decree of 2020 the minimum fee was increased to 2,500 euros per year (before it was 362 euros) in exchange, however, the amnesty on the appliances built on the beaches in concession. Even the 12-year extension (from 2020 to 2032) of concessions for stalls in public areas for street vendors has been censured by the Antitrust Authority as incompatible with EU competition rules. But on both issues the League and Forza Italia have taken up the barricades. And when they found out that in the draft bill there were rules providing for the tendering of these concessions, albeit with safeguard clauses for small concessionaires for the longest licenses, they asked to remove them."
" With the SPÖ there is only envy, resentment and class struggle, no ideas for new jobs. The FPÖ, in turn, professed to want to be an angry citizens' movement now and to hope for a political earthquake in the EU elections."
" With the annulment of the run-off election of the Federal President by the Constitutional Court, the first topic for the new ballot was also determined: Brexit and its consequences. To the right of the fault line the EU-sceptical FPÖ, to the left of it the Van der Bellen camp as guarantor of Austria's integration into the European Union. On Thursday, Alexander Van der Bellen went further in various media and accused Norbert Hofer of playing with fire."
" With the former you come off as someone his mother would be ashamed of, with the latter as someone people just laugh at. Since last Wednesday, Vox already has a European policy of its own. According to what Abascal said in the tribune, either the EU and Soros give up their criminal determination to put at our disposal 140,000 million to overcome the crisis or we will have to call an exit referendum.Or is Vox going to agree to put the eternal Spain of the Cid Campeador up for sale for a few billion?"
" With these premises, however, you will no longer find a party in Italy that can call itself pro-European and not Eurosceptic. Until now, Renzi, his government and the PD, along with the ally of the New Center-Right, had been seen as a bulwark against the 5 Star Movement, the League and those who attack Brussels for ideology or to obtain easy consensus. And they were."
" With these words Kurt Volker, special envoy of the Trump administration for Ukraine, does not intend to issue a warning, but to emphasize a fact: These are European measures, not Italian. Not respecting them would first of all cause a problem with Brussels.Let's go into detail. The elections of March 4 were won by the 5 Star Movement and the League. Matteo Salvini, who could become Italy's next premier, has said that if he went to Palazzo Chigi he would lift sanctions on Moscow."
" With two television channels and two radio stations arriving at the last minute for media coverage. The president of the Rassemblement National (ex-FN), who is launching this Sunday the campaign of the Rassemblement National for the European elections, wanted to use the fact that Chateauaudouble will soon welcome some asylum seekers in transit, to protest against the migratory flooding imposed by the European Union. \In Chateaudouble, as in hundreds of French villages, thousands of migrants are arriving and creating a lot of trouble, according to Rachline.On Wednesday, Marine Leiden was to make the rounds of Chateauguay, which voted 45% for her in the second round of the presidential election, which, counting abstentions, amounts to 11,113 votes."
" Without being a member of the EU and the eurozone, we would then be masters of our own rules again, such as on immigration and our own currency, the politician said. That the Netherlands should leave the EU will be the main topic in the upcoming PVV election campaign.,,Without leaving the European Union, we cannot defend our identity and fight against Islamization, he said earlier in a speech in New York."
" Without the angry citizen, as you know, we would not have had this debate: the country rejected the EU treaty in a referendum. Then it took the prime minister hours of calls and meetings to meet the angry citizen: the treaty will have an addition that emphasizes that Ukraine will not become an EU member.For the political representatives of the angry citizen PVV, SP and three new parties, this is not enough. No is no."
" Without them, however, there can be no far-reaching decisions, although a new balance between the EU institutions and its member states will become vital after the British leave. And Austria? The small country moves to the centre of events by taking over the EU Presidency from July, with an ÖVP-FPÖ government, of all things, whose small partner has traditionally been EU-sceptical or even hostile. There could also be many a small turnaround."
" Words greeted with a thread of annoyance. To be mischievous, one might think that the challenge of M5S and Lega to the EU Commission is almost sought after, pursuing the pattern of oligarchies against the people: a narrative chosen to ride a wave not only political but cultural that crosses the entire continent. And it can bring in votes."
 Would you go so far as to say that the FPÖ under Strache is less problematic - there were no Nazi allusions or trivialisations from him as party leader? Faymann assumes that Strache's isolationist anti-EU attitude is reason enough not to think of a possible joint SPÖ-FPÖ government. I absolutely agree with him.
" Wrong signals to the autocrat It is dangerous for the FPÖ to question the EU sanctions against Russia Wladimir Putin is known to feel at home in Austria. Whether privately or officially: apart from a few scattered demonstrators and critics, the Austrians have been courteous to the ski tourist as well as to Putin the politician."
" Xenophobia no longer catches on as strongly as it used to. 4.) If the FPÖ were a Greek party, its anti-EU policy would be counted in votes. Austria's taxpayers are helping to finance the bailouts, but at the same time the mood is growing again: better in the EU than out, better with the euro than back to the schilling."
" Yes and no. Yes for their postulates, but not because Brexit, Orbán, Salvini or Vox have served to engage Europe in a debate. The crises and the various anti-Europeanisms have politicized Europe."
" Yes, I want to do my utmost to ensure that this election strengthens Austria within the European Parliament and does not isolate it. A vote for the FPÖ, for EU opponents weakens Austria. @LU"
" Yes, the foreign ministry has been given to the Blue Party, but in the form of a woman without a Blue Party career. The FPÖ's distanced attitude to the EU was taken into account by the Federal Chancellor bringing the EU agendas from the Foreign Ministry to himself in the Chancellery, which was reportedly supported by the Federal President. The Ministry of Homeland Security envisaged by the FPÖ remained a thought bubble."
" Yesterday, on the other hand, some members of the large delegation from Turin on a mission to Russia must have jumped when they heard the mayor openly speak out against the sanctions decided by the European Union and in favor of the decision to include the revocation in the government contract. In these years the sanctions have not had any specific effect, on the contrary they have indirectly damaged the made in Italy and our farmers. As M5s we will commit ourselves in Europe so that Moscow returns to be an important interlocutor, both in terms of trade and for the stabilization of crisis areas. A sentence that would not have been out of place in the mouth of Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, in the eyes of the EU and the United States an unreliable supporter of Vladimir Putin. However, it should be considered that Turin has excellent relations with Russia and with Saint Petersburg in particular."
" Yesterday, the acting Minister gave an account of the matter, assuring to have acted with responsibility and solidarity. He also said that he managed to get the agreement between the EU and Turkey to include a ban on mass refoulements. The deputies of Esquerra, Podemos-En Comú Podem-En Marea protested against the agreement by standing up and folding their arms. But not as in the casatschok."
" You can pay with the euro in Switzerland, and the country, like Norway, is a member of the Schengen zone and, like Norway, has signed the Dublin Convention, which defines some of our asylum policies. Many of the regulations Wilders wants to get rid of have been aligned between Switzerland and the EU. If the PVV wants to break down the cooperation that European countries have built up since 1950 in order to isolate the Netherlands and bring it back to the situation of the 1940s, I think the name Albania on the North Sea is more appropriate..Marc van der Sluys, Nijmegen"

It did not pass, as had already happened for the motion of no confidence for the involvement of the Luxembourg President of the Commission in the LuxLeak scandal on secret tax favors to multinationals in Luxembourg, mainly thanks to the support of the Eurosocialists, of which the PD is part."
" Younger respondents are particularly convinced of the benefits of the EU. Those who predominantly see disadvantages, however, deserve a closer look: it is noticeable that women, inhabitants of rural regions and, above all, declared FPÖ voters tend to see themselves as disadvantaged by EU accession.

But the AfD leadership was clever enough to block the most radical demands for the party programme, such as the call for a minimum number of 200,000 deported migrants per year or for Germany to leave NATO.There have been many reasons in the past why no right-wing party has established itself permanently in Germany."

" happened in his October newsletter, It has long been a fact that Britain, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, has one of the most sensible attitudes to the EU to be found anywhere in Europe. In particular, the plan to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU inspires the Danish People's Party. But looking at the legal reservation, which is at the centre of Thursday's referendum in Denmark, the Danish People's Party is far more sceptical than its friends in Britain.First of all, the British have an opt-in system that is very similar to the one recommended by the Japanese in Denmark instead of the current legal reservation, which means that Denmark is automatically excluded from all supranational cooperation on this point."

Let's meet the seasoned base of the DF: With the LA's increasing Eurosceptic line, Mogens Camre must be the obvious Europe Minister - and we know where he stands: The Islamic parallel societies in the EU must be disbanded with the necessary use of force, and people who do not subscribe to European values must be expelled.

However, one should not forget that, for example, a popular scepticism about the euro and the EU as a whole, which goes far beyond the current AfD milieu, was a major motive for this party formation - a motive that one does not have to share, but which has a place in a democratic society.

"'Festschrift for Anthony Coughlan' A chara, - Eoin Ó Broin takes me to task for supposedly not spelling out the alternative to continued membership of the European Union (A Festschrift for Anthony Coughlan review: book fails to focus on its subject, Books, September 1st). I did exactly what I was asked to do - explain how the abandonment of the aim of Irish national independence came about, an abandonment which, it appears, Sinn Féin now supports. My argument is simple: membership of the EU ties us in to accepting neo-liberal economic policies that leave us at the mercy of international capital and make unconstitutional using the state as the main provider of employment and investment. I argue that ending those policies is essential to solving the housing and health crises, among others, points ironically that are strongly made by other Sinn Féin spokespeople, like Piaras Ó Dochartaigh and Louise O'Reilly."

"-- But I do not identify with the elite in the classical sense, because for me the elite is something closed, says Margrethe Vestager. When the Danish People's Party and Enhedslisten and many others in other countries criticize the 'EU elite', it shows, according to Vestager, that the elite template is used these years to create enemy images. This perhaps reveals that the whole question of elites is also a weapon in an ordinary power struggle."
"-- But even if Kjærsgaard indignantly denies any connection with Breivik, it is irrefutable that the Danish right-wing is in the whole of Europe spoiled for its extreme rhetoric. Morten Messerschmidt could not get a seat in the conservative Eurosceptic group after his election to the European Parliament in 2009. He was too rabid.Since the founding of the Danish People's Party, their elected representatives have said outrageous things that would make Mogens Glistrup blush with envy, and that by politicians who are still in office.During the opening of the Folketing in 2001, Pia Kjærsgaard said that it has been said that September 11th was the occasion for a clash of civilizations."
"-- But surely even a radical jubilant European has no hopes that the new government will abolish the legal reservation in order to open up a common asylum policy? No, unfortunately, I have no hopes of that, says Martin Lidegaard, but points out that there is also EU cooperation concerning refugees that Denmark can actually participate in without compromising the legal reservation. Our scepticism towards the EU should not only be interpreted as that we want to limit social benefits Peter Skaarup, Danish People's Party.Civic plan low on Danes' EU wish list The four civic parties, which are currently testing government constellations, joined forces during the election campaign on a more Eurosceptic line, proposing specifically to make it harder for other EU citizens to receive welfare benefits from Denmark."
"-- But the Dane is considering switching to the less Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, dominated by the Conservative ruling party in Britain. The chairman of Morten Messerschmidt's (DF) group in the European Parliament warns the Danish vote-getter against joining a less Eurosceptic group. The point about the British Conservatives is that they are not particularly Eurosceptic."
"-- But the ECR group in the European Parliament and the international umbrella organisation are not one and the same thing, Messerschmidt stresses. He also says he has been given a guarantee that the DF can oppose Turkish membership of the EU, which the ECR group otherwise favours. If it is up to me, Turkey should not be part of the EU either, and not only do we hold to that view, I have also been given a guarantee that we can hold to it as a member of the ECR Group, he says."
"-- But the hard part will be forging a sustainable cooperation between the parties that actually want to maintain full Danish membership - with or without reservations. DF and Enhedslisten will thrive on uncertainty and constantly provoke the pro-EU parties to promise a Danish referendum, sooner rather than later.For every step the Left and the Social Democrats take in their direction, the opponents will demand more, and Denmark will be irreparably sucked into the death spiral of division which has unfolded with devastating force in Britain."
"-- Fortunately, we also know that there is voter support for the EU's climate and environmental policies. Lowering the policy areas as EU tasks will certainly not make the EU more popular either in Denmark or in the rest of Europe.Even the Danish People's Party has sporadically supported the EU's environmental drive. But the DF's EU policy is indescribable, it resembles a chicken coop, where the fox has entered: the statements about the EU are flapping in many directions."
"-- Or it could be something completely third or fourth, she wrote in a weekly letter. In the intervening years, the line from the Danish People's Party has been criticism of the EU, but not opposition. In 2014, Morten Messerschmidt, the party's MEP, concluded in the political magazine Ræson: I have been drawing up the party's EU policy since 2005, and during that time it has been clear that a withdrawal was not on the agenda."
"-- The percentage of naysayers was over 50 across gender, regions, age groups, income levels and parties - in fact among all social groups except the 18-29 year olds and voters of the Radical Left, Socialist People's Party and Enhedslisten. The Danish People's Party, which has campaigned strongly against EU citizens' rights to Danish social benefits, had nearly 100 percent support among its voters for that course.The Wilke measurement was published at the same time as the temperature was taken for the European Parliament elections on 25 May."
"-- When asked about those points, Lower Saxony AfD politician Joachim Wundrak, who is running for top candidate together with Hessian MP Joana Cotar, said: Personally, I may have a slightly different stance on one or the other issue. According to the 65-year-old, he wants to campaign internally for a change of emphasis at the next opportunity. Cotar, 48, did not address the demand for an EU exit during the joint press statement of the candidate duo, but emphasised very strongly that the AfD does not simply want a Dexit, but a European Economic Community according to the old model. And looking at the other pair of candidates in the AfD, consisting of Bundestag parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel, 42, and 46-year-old party leader Tino Chrupalla, Cotar said that these two stood for liberality and freedom less than I did."
"-- but I understand why they take that view, when they generally think there should be referendums. Here there is a surrender of sovereignty, so it is perhaps not so strange that they say that we must indeed vote this time, says EU spokesperson Lykke Friis ( V).I think that the Danes should be asked Pia Adelsteen ( DF).0"
"-- but if you finally want to talk about the fact that the heads of state and government had to take into account the elections of the European Parliament when they appointed a new EU commission president, then it was hardly a signal for more union that they read? Well, the bourgeois parties behind Juncker became the largest group in the European Parliament, but they were also the biggest losers, going down 53 seats to 221. On the other hand, the big winners were Eurosceptic and outright anti-EU parties like UKIP, the French Front National and the Danish People's Party.So the bourgeois parties may have had a majority, but they shrank. And the trend is towards growing euroscepticism, which, despite the cooperation problems of nationalist parties, is taking root across large parts of the EU."
"-- but whether Messerschmidt & co. --may have a modest direct parliamentary influence, there is something to suggest that he and the many other Eurosceptic newly elected representatives in the rest of the EU may have an indirect influence.--In the same way that the DF has traditionally had on successive Danish governments since the party's inception. Simply by being the public voice of a growing resistance."
 - Let's start with an attack on the legal order. The EU wants Poland to preserve the independence of the courts. And PiS obviously doesn't want that. Also because the rule of law is an obvious constraint on power.
" Across Europe, the leaders of Eurosceptic parties are crowing victory. For example, Marine le Pen of the French Front National tweeted: 'Italians have shown their distaste for Prime Minister Renzi and the EU. They crave freedom and we have to listen to them.' PVV leader Geert Wilders wrote: 'Congratulations Italy.'Is the euro in danger now?"
" After the German government gave the green light to the Ceta free trade agreement in the Council of Ministers on Wednesday, resentment is rising among the liberal grassroots.

" Andreas Mölzer's FPÖ top candidacy for the EU elections will remain in limbo until Wednesday, when the blue party executive committee will decide on the matter: Neither he nor the FPÖ leader wanted to comment on Monday on the debate that Heinz-Christian Strache has scheduled for the afternoon. Officially, two FPÖ state leaders distanced themselves from Mölzer's comparison of the EU with the Third Reich and his description of it as a Negro conglomerate. Johann Tschürtz (Burgenland) and Markus Abzwerger (Tyrol) said the statements were unacceptable and necessary. In addition, the editor of Zur Zeit is said to have written the article in which the pitch-black footballer David Alaba is virtually denied under a pseudonym to be a real Austrian, which Mölzer rejects."
" Austria's MEPs do not fear a split in Europe, regardless of the outcome of the repeat election of the Federal President in December. The head of the ÖVP delegation in the European Parliament, Othmar Karas, declared on Wednesday in Brussels at an event organised by the NGO VoteWatch that he would come to a clear ""no"" on this question. Karas said that a federal presidential election cannot divide Europe. The dividing lines between the two candidates, Alexander Van der Bellen of the Greens and Norbert Hofer of the FPÖ, were not an Austrian phenomenon. He rejected the accusation that the EU was centralist. We are part of the EU, so there is no centralised EU."
" Austria's defeat at the hands of the EU Commission had been foreseeable: The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has condemned Austria for the direct award of public contracts for identity cards and official documents to the State Printing Office, which was privatised in 2000. Austria had awarded service contracts for the production of passports (with chips), emergency passports, residence permits, identity cards, driving licences in cheque card format and registration certificates in chip card format without an EU-wide call for tenders, thus violating EU law. In a first reaction, Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) promised to carry out EU-wide tenders, but criticised the ruling. The ECJ weights security interests lower than competition interests."
" Because the only task we have is to solve the problem that Denmark will leave Europol if we don't do anything, says Christina Egelund. From the Danish People's Party, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth makes it clear that the party will not recommend a yes vote in a new referendum unless Denmark also gets full powers to introduce border controls. The government can just call a vote on Schengen, says Kenneth Kristensen Berth."

" But tonight is about the future of Europe. For Jean-Marie Cavada, the last European elections were catastrophic because they brought to the Parliament a hundred or so anti-European members, including 24 French members of the National Front. However, he has hopes for the European Commission chaired by Jean-Claude Juncker. This is a historic moment,"" he says."
" Do you consider that we should proceed to transform the European Communities into a real Union, endowed with a Government responsible to Parliament, by entrusting to the European Parliament itself the mandate of drawing up a draft European Constitution to be submitted directly for ratification by the competent bodies of the Member States of the Community? The picture has changed since some political forces--the League, the 5 Star Movement--began painting the Europe of Brussels and the euro as a dangerous threat to national sovereignty and the well-being of Italians. Since then, the debate on Europe has stopped being a confrontation between divergent opinions and has become a sort of low-intensity civil war between traditional parties and anti-system forces."
" FPÖ leader and top candidate Heinz-Christian Strache was a guest on derStandard.at on Monday and took part in a discussion with users. Strache mentioned coalition conditions (implementation of direct democracy according to the Swiss model, referendum on the exit from the ESM debt dictate and halving of our EU contributions) as well as conditions for foreign students. One user wanted to know whether the FPÖ could not imagine tuition fees. In principle, every Austrian Matura student must also be entitled to a place at university, Strache replied; in the case of foreign students, he wants to oblige them to work as academics in Austria for a few years after their studies."
" I am certainly an enemy image for him. I crossed paths with Jörg Haider and his FPÖ when he went from being an ardent European to an EU opponent. And I promoted the Liberal Forum, and now I support the Neos, not to mention my anti-Hofer campaign."
" I don't want to be a judge of what they should do, but personally I would say that it is not unnatural that they go into government, Holst said. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, together with the Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives, has set out a more eurosceptic course than Denmark has so far adopted. A new government is expected to support British Prime Minister David Cameron wholeheartedly in efforts to achieve a new relationship with the EU than has been seen so far."
" I hear no contradiction between what Kenneth, Søren and I say. The line is absolutely clear in the Danish People's Party: we are not supporters of the EU we have today. We want another."
" I think Denmark will follow us out. If Britain votes for Brexit, and if there is then a referendum in Denmark, it could quickly become 'Dexit' too, said Nigel Farage in an interview with Politiken at the weekend.But the Danish People's Party does not want to vote Denmark out of the EU. Not if the British leave either."
" If we succeed in getting the government to agree on the European policy that we talked about with Lars Løkke Rasmussen during the election campaign, it is clear that there will be some hurdles that will be cleared, he says. Denmark's relationship with the EU has long been one of the major sticking points blocking government cooperation between the Danish People's Party and the Left. EU AGREEMENT It will not take a new general election to see the Danish People's Party in government if the party can agree with the Left on a common EU line after the referendum, says the DF leader."
" In a number of other countries there will be strong pressure on governments to have referendums too. Maybe not as far as a vote on the whole membership, but then on getting a new deal with the EU, says Sara Hagemann.among these countries is Denmark, where the Danish People's Party announced on Monday that the party will demand a vote on EU membership if the British leave the union. For Denmark and other countries outside the euro, the special situation is that in the British you lose the largest country outside the euro, which is thus an ally in the relationship between euro countries and non-euro countries, says Sara Hagemann."
" In addition to Denmark's sovereign right to decide who can stay, for example, to work, I am interested in the fact that the agreement obliges African countries to take back their own nationals, she writes. There is little to cheer about the agreement from either the Danish People's Party's or Enhedslisten's foreign affairs rapporteurs.The Danish People's Party's Søren Espersen believes that the EU is on the wrong track when it concludes an agreement that suggests that we should have more African immigrants in Europe. There should be no hope of getting to Europe."
" In order to make the euro a currency that is not vulnerable to the disasters we then pay for, we need to create systems where money transfers become permanent. We should address the fundamental flaw in the euro: there are countries that do not belong there because of their economic situation and, above all, because of their fiscal traditions, Halla-aho said.Salla said that the EU has its own crisis mechanism for banks, where banks have accumulated funds.Through this, Salla says, Italy has already been asked to clean up its bad debts."
" In view of Am Sonntag's triumph, one read something quite different in the Kurier: Hofer even declared his support for a joint supreme command in the event of an emergency. But as of now such a deployment for Austrian soldiers is out of the question for the blue candidate. At most, a certain coordination of the EU member states is conceivable for the FPÖ man: for example, when it comes to procurement. A joint headquarters, a medical command and cooperation in logistics are also possible, as suggested by Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil (SPÖ), who, like Chancellor and SPÖ leader Christian Kern, is also a strict opponent of an EU army."
" It is characteristic of the actions of this government that in such a situation it does not look for an agreement to reduce the damage to the country, but sharpens the course of confrontation, even when it threatens the elementary interests of the Polish state, - we read. The newspaper commentator adds that this applies not only to relations with the European Union, but even with a close ally like the United States, with which it has risked cooling relations by trying to take control of television Presumably, PiS does not want to take Poland out of the EU. But it is taking on the growing risk of a post-lexit, as the vision of an authoritarian state and the retention of power are placed above all else and become the de facto raison d'etre for PiS."
" It is logical that it looks like that from his point of view, says EU spokesperson Kenneth Kristensen Berth (DF) about Nigel Farage. The Danish People's Party points out that Ukip has always wanted Britain out of European cooperation, while the DF only wants a reformed EU.But the DF sees it as the official No campaign frontman, former London mayor Boris Johnson, will seek a new link to the EU. Even if it's a no vote in the referendum."

" It looks like the elections will confirm the fragmentation of the electorate in ten years, which will make the formation of a new government a little more difficult, the daily predicts. According to Le Monde, PVV leader Geert Wilders has once again succeeded in defining the theme of the campaign with his criticism of the 'dictates from Brussels': 'it revolves well and truly around Europe, which people in The Hague love less and less'. But the newspaper notes that Wilders' dream of becoming the leader of the largest party in the Netherlands has faded."
" It seems to me quite impossible that Denmark could join such a new treaty on bank rescues without the Danish people being asked. In reality, it would mean that Danish taxpayers' money could be used to cover the losses of foreign banks, says EU spokesman Nikolaj Villumsen of the Danish Green Party.Danish Labour Party chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl also predicts that a legal investigation will be needed into whether Danish participation entails a surrender of sovereignty under the Danish Constitution. I hope for a legal construction that involves the surrender of sovereignty."
" It sounds like treason, says Nigel Farage, chairman of the surging anti-EU United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip). GREAT BRITAIN Thulesen Dahl's hopes for a new British EU deal after a no vote are misguided, says the Ukip chairman.The target of his criticism is DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl, who has said Britain can probably negotiate a new deal with the EU even if Britons vote to leave on 23 June. In April, Thulesen Dahl said that the most likely scenario after a British no is a new form of intermediate EU membership."
" It was agreed that the number of those currently seeking asylum in Europe is plunging the community of states into a crisis. But for EU mandate holder Eugen Freund (SPÖ), who like his colleagues from the EU Parliament has recently been given the right to speak in the Austrian plenary, it is a distribution crisis. The Green EU politician Michel Reimon calls it a European crisis and presumably means the same as his party colleague Werner Kogler, who sees the actions of the EU states as a solidarity crisis. Only the FPÖ prefers to speak of a migration problem. On Wednesday morning, Johanna Mikl-Leitner (ÖVP) simultaneously tried to solve problems with terminology - with little success (see above)."
" It would be interesting if Denmark said you also want an in-out referendum on your EU membership, says Simon Hix, professor of European politics at the London School of Economics. The blue parties are not going so far as to talk about a vote along the lines promised by Britain's Conservative leader by 2017. But they declare their desire to stand behind the work of Britain and other like-minded countries to ensure that the EU does not become a social union. Heavily inspired by the Danish People's Party, the blue parties are pledging to follow Cameron's lead in warming up to the social rights of poor EU citizens in wealthy member states. A new majority will work to ensure that Danish welfare benefits remain in Denmark and go to those who work, live and contribute to Denmark over a longer period of time, says the paper - which foresees changing Danish legislation and introducing accrual principles where possible across all Danish welfare benefits."
 Nefarious policy Podemos opposes head-on to the new demands for cuts from the EU. It is directly related to the nefarious economic policy of the PP.
" No, it doesn't worry me! It makes me combative! You have to put an end to this spook for once. Populist parties, but also Austria's government, want to rant about Europe, but at the end of the day they reject two things: a euro exit and an EU exit, although the FPÖ has propagated this time and again. There is a struggle to shape Europe and this challenge must be taken up."
" No, the health issue is not adequately addressed; and our quality products are not protected. If the Ceta were to pass, the EU would be even more of a business committee in the hands of multinationals.In addition to the League, you find yourself conducting this battle alongside M5S, Sinistra italiana, Cgil. And with Coldiretti: not surprisingly, with those who produce."
" Shame Rajoy has not yet appeared before Congress to report on the European summit of February 18 and 19 -that one, formally, European Council-, which approved the concessions to avoid Brexit, the exit of the United Kingdom from the Union.The secretary general of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, said via Twitter that he feels ashamed of the EU that systematically violates human rights. According to the emerging party, the agreement infringes on the right to asylum."
" Sinn Féin's cack-handed call for an immediate Border poll after the Brexit referendum certainly deserved the criticisms it got from other nationalists and unionists, based on a realistic evaluation of recent polling in the North which decisively rejects Irish unity. Martin and Kenny's case is more long-term, anticipating a possible decisive shift in unionist attitudes confronted with a certain Brexit scenario linked to UK break-up. Sinn Féin's own evolution from a sceptical sovereigntist opposition to the EU towards a left-critical stance, accepting it with a different form and policies, is more significant than its reversion to slogans about unity. It has yet to come to terms with the possibility that a united Ireland is more likely to arise from wider British and European tensions than from purely Irish ones."
" Technically, you have to be in a group. We aim to create a more homogeneous group than the EFD after the elections, when the Eurosceptics gain ground. The Danish People's Party is currently courting cooperation with David Cameron's British Conservatives. However, an anonymous senior source in the party rejects that idea to The Guardian."
" Thank God for the Danish reservation. There are plenty of strong forces that still want an EU army, says Morten Messerschmidt, who sits in the European Parliament for the Danish People's Party.The desire for an EU army is particularly evident in the fact that the German government welcomes Juncker's proposal, Messerschmidt points out.Regardless of German support, however, it will hardly lead to an EU army with only Denmark on the outside."
" The Danish People's Party are not real nationalists. They are 'welfare chauvinists' who want to protect the Danish welfare state from immigration and the EU. It's not the same thing, says Dirk Evers.The DF has weeded out all the village idiots and the scatterbrained elements. They have a president at the helm who looks like the ideal son-in-law, with policies that appeal to both social democrats and liberals."
" The Danish People's Party is a declared Eurosceptic party, but is in fact helping to keep its hand under Danish EU commitments. Normally, parties critical of the EU do so only if they are part of the European political agreement between parties that have committed themselves to upholding Danish commitments in the EU. The Danish People's Party is not in the agreement, but behaves as if it is. DF is clear that the party votes for many EU laws. When we take a position on a bill, we do so on the basis of its content."
" The SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens are outraged by Andreas Mölzer, the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU elections. On the contrary, on Sunday Mölzer once again confirmed his comparison of the Nazi regime with the EU. In an interview with Österreich, the FPÖ MP justified himself: ""I made a general comparison with the regimes in the 20th century. Century made."
" The UK is allowed to carry out checks on people at border crossings, but that's because it's not part of Schengen, says Gerd Battrup. Difficult to copy the British model The Danish People's Party has said during the negotiations that it will stay within EU rules. But Vice-President Peter Skaarup still thinks that the British model could be interesting."
" The conditions for this ( if the EU does not abandon centralism , if Turkey joins ) are pretended. The fact is: Hofer, like the entire FPÖ, belongs to the right-wing populists who want to destroy the EU. The kiss on the hand for"
" The euro is a misconstruction for them. They fear an Islamisation of the Union through mass immigration. And in general, they now want to stand up to EU centralism together: On Monday, Heinz-Christian Strache announced that his FPÖ had agreed on a document with other right-wing parties in Europe at a meeting in Vienna at the end of last week. The declared aim is to enter the EU Parliament as a parliamentary group after the EU elections in May, as Europe's third force after the Social Democrats and the Conservatives."
" The writer Michael Köhlmeier is reporting Andreas Mölzer for incitement to hatred next Friday and is looking for supporters to join his complaint via the SOS Mitmensch website. The aim is a broad ""no"" to racism and Nazi trivialisation, because the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU elections compared the Union to the Third Reich and spoke of a Negro conglomerate. Within a few hours this Friday, more than 2000 supporters were found for the action."
" The ÖVP puts the rod in the window for the Freedom Party for future coalition negotiations. If the FPÖ does not change its fundamentally anti-EU stance, it will be very difficult for it to participate in a government, said ÖVP Secretary General Werner Amon in the STANDARD-Interview."
" There is not a shadow of doubt that they are running away from the promises they made to the Danes back then. -- These are promises that for many people have probably been decisive in deciding where to vote, says EU spokesperson Jan E. Jørgensen.(V) The Liberal Alliance, which like the DF recommended a no vote in the referendum, is not sympathetic either. EU spokesperson Christina Egelund calls the manoeuvre by the DF a very big U-turn."
" These motifs lead on to the next attempt to frame the pandemic with a right-wing interpretive pattern: the linking of the disease with migration. Media like the AfD-affiliated In the first phase, the European Union also fell away as an enemy image of the right. Since it was hardly present as a crisis actor, the tried and tested warning against the superstructure could not catch on this time."
" They worked better for Greece. Do you know that for the League, the fact that the EU abandoned Italy on migrants was an electoral boon? We have not abandoned you."
" This is something that should be a very high priority, and it's not a debate that the Prime Minister needs a lot of time to prepare for. It's crazy that we can't have a proper debate about Denmark's role in the EU, he says. The Danish People's Party is calling for a broad debate on the future of the EU as early as this year and has the support of the V and K parties. But the Prime Minister cannot find the time to attend."
" This means that in all areas other than the legal reservation we can say to the people that if you want a more critical attitude towards the EU, it can also be implemented after an election. Other parties do not want to be tied to a particular EU policy. Instead, it will be tied to a debate. This means that we will be able to use the strength that the Danish People's Party gains to ensure a more critical Danish EU policy, says Kristian Thulesen Dahl.-- But it still says that Denmark must be at the heart of the EU."
" Total failure, alarming A total failure of the SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens, stated FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache on Facebook. What still has to happen for the EU to finally break off all accession negotiations with Turkey? In a press release, Alev Korun, the migration and integration spokesperson of the Green Party, spoke of the questionable democratic voting behaviour of Turks living in Austria who are entitled to vote: They had voted for Erdogan with a large majority (see below)."
" Unfortunately, this is an expression that, at the end of the day, the Left has not understood what we are facing here. The Left has a tendency to be lured by the big boys in EU cooperation, and that is probably what is happening here. I would advise against that, says Martin Henriksen, the DF's spokesperson on immigration and integration.The Danish People's Party believes that completely different tools need to be used."
" We await further explanations from the government. We have not definitively rejected the investigation verdict, but we still have doubts, says Kenneth Kristensen Berth, the DF's EU spokesperson, cautiously.He is in a hurry, because the Danish People's Party promised voters during its 'no' campaign that Denmark could easily get a parallel agreement on Europol - even before the new supranational police cooperation comes into force on 1 May 2017."
" We don't need to commit to the letter combinations. But when it comes to the Danish People's Party, Lars Løkke has said both before and after the election that he does not see the Danish People's Party in his government. He has said that very clearly, says Ellen Trane Nørby.In particular, the EU and values policy stand in the way of government cooperation, she believes.An argument that Pia Kjærsgaard purely rejects."
" We have a very politicized court. It would be nice if some of the Union parties in Parliament also started to have a bit of critical sense, says EU spokesperson Pia Adelsteen (DF).0"
" We mostly use the database to investigate travelling criminals, explains Ulrik Bang, as he moves his mouse around to show how the system works in practice. EUROPOL FEATURE The government is expected to reach a special agreement with the EU on Europol police cooperation shortly. But it won't be as good as the DF promised voters before last year's referendum. Soon, direct Danish network access may be closed."
" We need to radically reform the European Union, starting with strengthening the role of the European Parliament, which must have the power of legislative initiative. All that? Isn't this a weak proposal in the face of anti-EU criticism from radical forces like the League? A European solution to the migratory phenomenon must be found."
" Well, having doubts is legitimate. If one is not convinced about the no to the euro, if one is not convinced about the alliance with Marine Le Pen, everything is fine. But if I had had these doubts, well... I would not have tripled the consensus of the League.Tosi asks that Zaia may be supported by other civic lists in addition to the one in the governor's name."
" What are the demands we have accepted? The hard line on Europe, the flat tax, the ok to the dl security, the EU commissioner to the League...Ah, why have we ever been compliant with Europe? I understand that in politics everyone has a short memory, but against the Europe of cuts and austerity I would say that the Movement has never spared itself."
" With all due respect to beautiful Denmark, you are not Great Britain. If a small country like Denmark also starts demanding tailor-made membership, the risk of a domino effect across the EU is too great. Denmark does not carry the same weight at all, says the French expert.The Danish People's Party has taken the position that we must follow the British course in Europe, regardless of the outcome of the British referendum. The problem is that no one knows where that course will lead if there is a no vote on 23 June."
" Yes, Macron's victory means that the mystifications and catastrophisms preached by populist movements can be defeated without making concessions to them with ambiguous positions towards a coherent and combative Europeanist choice. But quite a few in Italy are only now discovering this, after trying to compete with Lega and M5S with outsized polemics against the European Union and its institutions. And even in the daily press there were voices, during the election campaign in France, very hesitant to grasp the value of the candidate running for victory and rather indulgent towards the most negative and radical positions towards Europe."
" among the declared libertarians, however, only 27 percent want to recognise this. Both statements were already polled in 2014, at which time comparatively fewer Austrians were taken by the advantages of the EU over Russia and the USA. Continuing scepticism of the FPÖObviously, the scepticism of FPÖ voters has declined in the past five years, but this cannot be said with statistical certainty due to the smaller sample size of the comparative survey. But what the comparison of the two surveys in the time interval shows: Austrians today agree more than they did then (56 per cent, up ten points on the comparative survey) with the statement that the EU is a"
" and doesn't just mean their own party: What's so bad about Red-Blue? The FPÖ's hostility to the EU does not scare Fiedler much: Since most decisions are made in Brussels, the FPÖ can do far less harm than is believed. The Austrian representative of Transparency International does not accept the corruption of the last blue government as an argument for all time and eternity, since the protagonists of that time are no longer in politics: ""In the FPÖ there was definitely a renewal of personnel."
" the two opponents thematically positioned themselves with the Brexit. FPÖ candidate Hofer called again in Austria for an EU exit referendum if Turkey enters the Union, but also if the EU becomes more centralised . He thus sharpened the tone compared to what he had said at the end of April: there he said he had never advocated an EU exit, but wanted the EU to concentrate on essential issues such as nuclear power plant safety and leave issues such as shower heads or tractor seats as well as agriculture to the nation states.The former Green Party leader Van der Bellen, on the other hand, has positioned himself pro-European for years and believes that the Brexit debate will benefit him."
 ÖVP Secretary General and Security Spokesperson They want out of the EU. Of course you are playing with the Öxit. Neos leader Matthias Strolz in the direction of the FPÖit is regrettable that the FPÖ is pulling back again here in this matter. But that is quite deliberately her style.
"'Baudet reforms party to loud applause' (AD 2-12). Forum for Democracy wants the Netherlands to leave the EU. At the party congress, Donald Trump was applauded, the U.S. ambassador was guest of honor, and the party leader promised that if FvD comes to power, the defense budget will be increased to the 2 percent desired by Trump."
"'Kaltbach' shows what Eurosceptic politicians mean when they cite Switzerland or Norway as shining examples: you apparently don't need to surrender either to the euro or to the European Union to remain politically independent and economically successful. 'Out of the euro, out of the EU,' Geert Wilders' PVV therefore says, although given the polls that still seems two steps too far for the Netherlands. But in the UK, not a euro country and always wary of European integration, EU membership is more seriously under discussion, and not just on the right."
"'She is exercising her ability to reach a personal decision and to campaign for Britain to leave the EU, and that's absolutely right she is able to do that. I think the key thing is everybody in Northern Ireland should make up their own mind based on the evidence, and I look forward to coming to try to help persuade them to remain in a reformed EU.' Sinn Féin and the SDLP have insisted Ms Villiers is not in tune with public opinion in the North.The Stormont Deputy First Minister, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness, said the Conservative MP should quit."
"'Two major political parties, PVV and SP, don't like Europe at all', writes Meindert van der Kaaij in his analysis of the queen's Christmas speech (Trouw, December 27, 2012). As far as the PVV is concerned, that is true, but not as far as the SP is concerned. The SP is indeed (rightly) critical of how the European Union came about and functions, but that is something else than being against Europe. It's a subtle distinction, I realize."
"( The party has not yet nominated candidates) Our main opponents are the parties that want more integration in the EU and less nation - like V, K, R and SF. They want to take the EU even further away from what the EU should be focusing on: peace and the single market.DF is on a track of its own. The one main opponent is the DF."
"(V) Nor is there understanding among the Liberal Alliance, which like the DF recommended a no vote in the referendum. EU spokesperson Christina Egelund calls the manoeuvre by the DF a very big U-turn. And a very unfortunate one at that, because it can have very concrete and unfortunate consequences for our police and our ability to fight cross-border crime."

", Today is the day that we take back our country, Baudet declared earlier in the day in front of the influx of supporters in Almere. FvD's classic positions - fighting mass immigration, less EU and climate madness - faded into the background during the corona crisis. Opposition to the cabinet's corona policy was the spearhead of the FvD campaign, which Baudet shaped by traveling around the country with a freedom caravan."

It is really high time to end the EU accession negotiations with Turkey once and for all, said Thierry Baudet of Forum for Democracy.Van Ojik (GL) believes that Erdogan is putting himself out of business with this."
"- Contrary to what his fiercest critics say, Kaczynski is not at all assuming a polexit. He is aware of the benefits Poland has gained, including under the PiS government, from its presence in the EU. But he will only step back when that Union sword of Damocles is flying at his head."
"- The principle of priority was known to the Polish authorities upon accession to the EU and was accepted, recalled Miroslaw Wróblewski, the representative of the ROP. See VIDEO: Marek Ast of PiS is writhing. The principle of the primacy of EU law over national law was agreed to by all EU countries when they signed the Lisbon Treaty. Ast was in favor."

The former president commented in an interview that PiS likes the EU as far as it is useful for them. - Even those who don't like the EU very much, like Ms. Judge Pawlowicz or a couple of people we know from the government, won't say out loud that they are in favor of polexit, because they know that more than 70 percent of the population is in favor of the EU. Poles are in favor of the EU."
"-M. Camus sees more ideological coherence in Philippot's anti-EU rhetoric than in the FN, where the leadership relies on activists to decide whether to keep the exit from the euro a priority before the March congress.But an FN executive reproaches the MEP for not having wanted to assume the failure of the presidential elections, where his proposal to leave the euro did not convince."
"-Nachfrage with the fact that the special subsidy is unconstitutional according to the state government. The FPÖ wants Austrian citizens to be given preference in the allocation of housing.

"2014 will be the year when euroscepticism, anti-immigration, nationalism, populism and protest of all kinds get a historic makeover. Qualified guesses suggest that as many as 25% of the seats will go to Marine Le Pen's Front National, the UK Independence Party, Germany's Alternative für Deutschland (which wants to dismantle the euro), Geert Wilder's Freedom Party, Beppe Grillo's 5 Stelle movement and a number of other protest parties.In Denmark, the Danish People's Party with Morten Messerschmidt stands to repeat its 2009 success and have an excellent election, while Rina Ronja Kari of the People's Movement Against the EU is a more obscure figure.The other Danish candidates will probably feel pressured to sound more sceptical than they are."
"2016 was also the year Donald Trump was elected US president, Tayyip Erdogan took total power in Turkey and has been exercising repression ever since. And in which Europe's extreme right-wing populists around Marine Le Pen of the Front National and Lega leader Matteo Salvini declared war on the EU and the euro. The FPÖ was (and still is) one of the participants.While Le Pen did not become French president, the new Italian government with Salvini continues the course: chaos and dismantling of this deepened EU."
"3 Leaving the EU? More questions The most important fact of the 2019 elections is that most of the so-called Eurosceptic parties have abandoned the idea of leaving the European Union. The RN has abandoned the idea of leaving the euro, which was the keystone of its economic project from 2012 to 2017. In Italy, Matteo Salvini is now ruling out a referendum on the euro."
"3 Vienna for soft, Berlin for hard line on Russia sanctions Just as with the distribution of refugees, Austria once supported the EU decision on the Russia sanctions. But at the latest with the entry of the FPÖ into the federal government, differences with Germany and other EU partners have become apparent here as well. Merkel strictly adheres to the measures against the occupation of Crimea, which is against international law."
"9You said earlier that the two things are off the table: Turkey's accession and a move towards a central state. If one of the two were to come back on the agenda - for example, in the direction of a United States of Europe, as the Neos are calling for - would you then again be able to come to terms with the idea of leaving the EU?The FPÖ is the guarantor that such a thing will not happen. We have laid this down in the government agreement."
"@JV Ceta ratification. The FPÖ will not fulfil its election promise to bring down the EU's trade agreement with Canada via a referendum. As recently as January, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had declared that the successful Ceta/TTIP/Tisa referendum should not be shelved, but that a referendum should be held."
"A lot has happened since December, and what was cool logic then has become politically sensitive. The Danish People's Party has lost all appetite for a possible referendum on more EU. What in December was the party's own declared plan B, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth today calls a form of advanced masochism."
"A nod to the villagers was also made by Komorowski. He promised on Wednesday to quickly pass a law restricting the freedom of citizens of other EU countries to acquire land in Poland. The law has been demanded by the coalition PSL, as well as the Law and Justice party, due to the fact that EU citizens will gain the right to acquire land in Poland from May 2016.For the rest of the campaign, the president will mobilize voters in western Poland, where he has lost many votes in five years."
"A number of groups opposed to the treaty have already indicated their intention of issuing a court challenge if a referendum is not held, and so the issue is likely to come before the Supreme Court irrespective of the President s decision. With Sinn Féin and left-wing TDs opposed to the EU spearheading a campaign for a referendum, it is possible that an attempt may be made to force the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.Under article 27 of the Constitution, a petition supported by a majority of the Seanad and one-third of the Dáil can be presented to the President, asking him to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court."
"A scenario that has been seen before, but which depends on a decision to annul ineligibility. Berluscioni will, in any case, have to deal with the young leader of the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, whose model is Marine Le Pen's National Front.See also:"
"A strategy paper stresses three key objectives: to oppose the exit from the EU, to campaign to recognise the democratic vote of Northern Ireland and to encourage greater co-operation between the North and the Republic of Ireland. In the document, Sinn Féin outlines concerns about the effect a British exit, colloquially known as Brexit, could have on the economy in Northern Ireland and the North's relations with the Republic.Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said: Under normal circumstances we would allow the British people to control their own destiny."
"A union of the hard right would give a better picture of the political balance of power in Europe. If we add up the 74 seats of ID, dominated by the RN and the League, the 63 eurosceptic elected members of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), crushed by the PiS (27 elected members) since the departure of the British conservatives, and the 12 elected members of Fidesz who sit in the non-attached party, we end up with 149 MEPs. This new group would thus become the second largest in the Parliament, behind the EPP (175 members, including the 7 elected LR members and one elected Les Centristes), but ahead of the Socialists of S&D (145) and above all the centrists of Renew (98) where the LREM members sit."
"A week ago, the Hungarian Chancellery Minister, Gergely Gulyás, had been in Vienna and had spoken there on the same day with the ÖVP and with the FPÖ leaders - with the ÖVP apparently in order to dissuade them from turning against Orbán, and with the FPÖ in order to establish a safety net in the event of Fidesz being expelled from the EPP. FPÖ party leader Heinz-Christian Strache had already offered several times to welcome Fidesz to the EU-sceptical Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group. In terms of content, Fidesz would fit in quite well there."
"Abut in a pinch, a junior partnership under Kurz is also conceivable, though it would mean swallowing several tonnes of toads. And Kurz would perhaps do the same, because the FPÖ, which is still hostile to the EU, would be unpleasant for him in Europe."
"AT TALE EU down, however, is - sadly - the new black and certainly not something reserved for British media. Recently, Berlingske chose to devote two pages of column space first to a major interview critical of the EU with Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen (V) and the following day with the leader of the Danish People's Party, Kristian Thulesen Dahl. Admittedly, the journalist forgot to ask the Foreign Minister what he was so unhappy about, out of sheer sensationalism, so we never found out."
"According to Eastwood, his party offers a different, more productive and co-operative form of nationalism than Sinn Féin: I don't think Sinn Féin wants to make Northern Ireland work. Sinn Féin is about rhetoric. We want to get down and do the job.He calls Brexit a monumental problem for the North as well as the British and Irish governments. Unionists have rubbished his proposal for Northern Ireland to be given special status within the EU, but he insists the entirety of the UK need not be forced to quit Europe."
"According to Kaczynski, the European Union was a success until it made two mistakes. - the Lisbon Treaty and the refugee crisis. - Ã¢â'¬ÅIn order to survive, the EU needs to fundamentally reform itself,Ã¢â'¬Â a Polish politician believes.Ã¢â'¬Â The PiS president has advocated changes to European treaties. - We need to strengthen national states and limit the competences of the Union."
"According to him, the pro-EU parties are thus leaving the field to the leaders of the no parties in the Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten and Liberal Alliance, who in turn often use national parliamentary speeches and other political platforms to talk thunder about, for example, welfare tourism in the EU. The consequence, says the MEP, is that we are moving towards the UK, where there is a really negative mood about the EU.In recent polls, the Danish People's Party, led by candidate Morten Messerschmidt, is set to outperform both the Left and the Social Democrats in the EP elections. Social Democratic candidate Gunde Odgaard says it seems that both the government and parliamentary politicians notoriously do not want to discuss the EU."
"Actually, one could now sit back and relax in Brussels and watch the British with interest as they tear themselves apart domestically. Instead, the strange Mr And provides the fodder that makes anti-European right-wing populists - from UKIP to the FPÖ here - grow ever stronger. Apparently, even after the loud bang on the other side of the Channel, people at EU headquarters still haven't understood that the Europe of the elites is dead as a doornail. It was spectacularly voted out of office in Britain a week ago after many failures (not least the complete failure on immigration policy)."
"Adam, on the other hand, wants to avoid this. We urgently need a united AfD at the moment to draw attention to the democratic deficit in the EU, which has brought the Troika government to the Greeks and is rightly driving the people onto the streets.Lucke sees himself confirmed in the Greek question by media reports on a changed attitude of the German government to a euro exit of the crisis country."
"Add to this the fact that Transfer union, Eurobonds - the buzzwords from the days of the struggle for the bailout packages could soon shape the debate again, also because with AfD and FDP now almost 25 percent of the members of the Bundestag Even in EU capitals from The Hague to Helsinki, the enthusiasm about the coalition agreement is manageable. This begins with the idea of transforming the ESM, which has been expanded into the European Monetary Fund, into European Community law."
"After EU President Donald Tusk on Tuesday heightened uncertainty about whether Denmark can get a parallel deal, the focus has turned to the No parties' plan B. But in the DF, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth will not guarantee that his party will support the calling of a new referendum that could transfer the limited sovereignty to the EU and thus keep Denmark inside Europol. We can't take a position on that yet, because it depends on the circumstances of that referendum."
"After Nice last year, she chose to mobilise her troops in Metz, in a region where her party is well established electorally, for a patriotic banquet attended by a thousand of her supporters. Chernobyl Three weeks before the European elections, Marine Le Pen has launched a violent attack on the European Union, which she describes as imperial, hegemonic and totalitarian The president of the Rassemblement National has condemned the construction of Europe as an economic, social, demographic and identity-related Chernobyl. It targeted the founding fathers of the Union, the Monnets, the Schumanns, taking up the theses, contested by many historians, of Philippe de Villiers."
"Again, it's somewhat ironic that Sinn Féin seems to be gaining because of its stance on Brexit. Historically, the party has trenchantly opposed any treaty or major proposal from Brussels but, on the issue of Brexit, it made a strategic decision that it was in the best interests of its political rationale to oppose the North's exit from the EU.There is no doubt that the Sinn Féin tails are up, and the party will drive a very hard bargain. The pleading by the Irish and British governments that there should be 'no red lines' fell on deaf ears."
"Alarming signs of disenfranchisement are now emerging. Internally, political forces hostile to Europe and the single currency have emerged or grown: Lega, Fratelli d'Italia, the Five Star Movement, Forza Italia itself. Externally, the waters of the EU have become stormy and the institutions in Brussels have lost the ability to synthesize between the needs, interests, cultures of the North, South and East. In this climate, the risk of losing the anchor is high."
"Alleanze Salvini's closure towards Ncd is clear: never with them at the Regionals, because Alfano supports the Renzi government. Dialogue with FI started: as long as it remains in opposition Euro Enough euro, slogan of the vote for the EU Parliament, is now the line of the League: Eurosceptics, against the single currencyParty Less federalist, more nationalist."
"Allied to this are claims of a conspiracy between the Government and the EU officials to ensure the will of the people is circumvented through a treaty designed to accord with the Irish Constitution. It is not surprising that Sinn Féin, the United Left Alliance and anti-EU Independents have made a lot of noise, demanding that a referendum should be held regardless of whether it is legally required.What is surprising, though, is that Fianna Fáil has gone down this road as well."
"Already, many questions have been raised in the North of a British Secretary of State who has a position to leave the European Union, whether that person has the best interests of people of the North at her heart, Mr McGuinness said. The senior Sinn Féin politician also said he was disappointed at the decision by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to support Britain leaving the EU.Mr Adams said although Sinn Féin was critical of the workings of the EU, the prospect of a 'Brexit' was deeply concerning.We want to see it more democratic, we want to see it more citizen centred, the Louth TD said."
"Alternatives will rise in the street and appeal to the lower middle class, focusing only on PO and Modern will limit the opposition's ability to win. Win with PiS we can only we, the Poles. Through elections. We have to do it ourselves. Nobody will help us, not even the EU threatening us with article 7. Only you and I can do it. Enjoying the freedom we got in '89 is a privilege."
"An almost euphoric MEP like Morten Messerschmidt has demanded after the election that a V-DF government reintroduces border controls, and he demands that Lars Løkke binds himself to the EU reservations. He has claimed that a massive majority of the population today wants less EU and supports for example the Danish People's Party's demand for Danish control of Denmark's borders. The DF is trying to convince voters and opinion formers that it is popular to criticise the EU and to put up borders for migrant workers from other EU countries. They do not shy away from calling even pragmatic EU supporters out of touch with reality, socialist guardians, who do not understand the peculiarly Danish and who just live increasingly decoupled in the Brussels East."
"An obvious advantage of taking the big referendum on membership is that it will make life much easier for a future bourgeois government. Today it is not really clear whether it is the so-called pro-European line of the Left or the EU-sceptic line of the Danish Parliament.Let's have a pop or trap referendum that decides once and for all whether we will continue to be members of the EU, with all that entails."
"And I am now very little proud of the lack of European commitment, anti-European rhetoric and the smile of the Danish People's Party's people's leader in the European Parliament. Where is the Left's political leadership for European cooperation? Does the Venstres parliamentary group consist of 47 EU sceptics? Or is it about the fact that the leadership and members of the parliament of the Liberal Party have become a dictating lame duck to the DF? Is it a case of not daring to speak positively about the EU for fear that, when the government changes, the DF will veto any ministerial items if they have shown a pro-European commitment? It is shameful that what used to be Denmark's leading European party now defines its European policy solely in the interests of a narrow-minded and parochial DF.Has the Left lost touch with what is happening outside the Danish allotment garden?."
"And I won't hide the fact that it would be good to have CETA to have something to mirror the UK. The UK must have an agreement in connection with its withdrawal, and it may well be with CETA as a template, says the DF's EU spokesman, Kenneth Kristensen Berth.The new British minister for withdrawal from the EU, David Davis, has according to the Guardian newspaper highlighted CETA as a very good starting point for our discussions with the Commission. The 1,600-page agreement has been called the EU's most ambitious free trade deal to date by the European Commission."
"And Jaroslaw Kaczynski has threatened that Poles' pockets may be reduced after adopting the euro. At the same time, PiS president emphasized that he is not against euro at all. He stated that the Treaty of Accession [to the EU] obliges us to adopt the euro, but it does not specify the date, and therefore I will say this: we will adopt the euro one day, because these are our obligations, and we are and will be in the European Union. But we will adopt if it is in our interest, and it will be in our interest when we reach a level at least very close to Germany, the level of GDP, the level of living standards."
"And he's far from afraid to be. Kenneth Kristensen Berth has both received a 14-day suspended prison sentence for violating the racism paragraph, called Enhedslisten's Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen a low-ringed folk seducer with fleeting little girl charm and as EU spokesman for the DF has pulled the party in a more Eurosceptic direction.Kenneth Kristensen Berth only got a seat in Parliament after the 2015 elections, but since 1999 he has been chairman of DF's Youth (1999-2007), a member of DF's main board (1999-2013) and worked as an assistant and consultant in the party."
"And since the Deal and the National Reconstruction Plan do not offer much to these young people, they will not obscure the image of power that PiS itself has created: Mr. Kaczynski and Mr. Czarnek, wearing the uniforms of the soldiers of the cursed and with the walking sticks teach the youth how to live. The EU money-supported Lad and KPO bind PiS and the EU with an iron chain - this is Kaczynski's next hell. PiS has already begun to fear the EU because it depends on EU funds as never before. The government's fear is evidenced by its hysteria over the EU Court of Justice's (CJEU) decisions on the rule of law and the order to halt work at the Turów mine."
"Andreas Khol, in turn, constructs a purification process for the Freedom Party that is not so true. The FPÖ is still against the EU as a union of liberal democracies, has just written Germanness back into its programme (dominated by German nationalist Burschenschaftern) and is striving for a presidential regime along the lines of Erdogan.Even in broader circles of the population, the seemingly unstoppable is already anticipated."
"Andreas mölzer (60), FPÖ MEP since July 2009, once a mastermind for FPÖ leader Jörg Haider, until the break in 2005, representative of the party's German nationalist wing. p"
"Andrzej Halicki (PO) emphasized that the proceedings under article 7 are directed not so much against Poland as against its current authorities. MEPs from parties that signed a joint declaration with the Law and Justice party on the future of Europe last week defended the governments of Poland and Hungary, especially their right to act without looking to Brussels. The main idea of the declaration is to oppose the EU, which is increasingly becoming a tool of radical forces seeking cultural and religious transformation and seeks to destroy European traditions, social institutions and moral principles.This document was signed by PiS, Fidesz, the parties of Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini, the Freedom Party of Austria and about ten other far-right or at least populist-right formations."

"Answer: Greens, FPÖ and BZÖ criticise that tax rates are too low and evaders get off too cheaply. The EU Commission fears that the agreements will make cooperation between tax authorities more difficult in the future. For the taxation of interest payments that fall under the EU Savings Directive (such as savings book interest), the tax rate of 35 percent remains in place."
"Apart from the booster effect that such an unexpected success would represent for the far-right party - yes, the far-right - there is the rise of this political movement in much of Europe that I have no desire to encourage. And I don't think that bringing more FN, more demagogy, more anti-European sentiment into the European Parliament helps in any way to change this Europe. Because even if the current European Union is at a dead end, I don't want to live in a Europe where borders would be back, where movement would be hindered, where students would not be able to experience the 'other'."
"Apart from your editorial, the critical articles by editor Böhm and especially Ms Rohrer are anything but party-politically neutral. Like the ÖVP, the FPÖ is also committed to the community of states, but would like to see a reformation of the EU administration in Brussels, which would also be very important for the cohesion of the states, which is increasingly crumbling.In this context, a more restrictive emigration policy, as planned by the new coalition, is the right thing to do so that the EU does not ultimately fall apart."
"Approachment on the migration issue. On the migration issue, Kurz's restrictive policies - cuts in benefits for asylum seekers, proposals for deportation camps outside the EU or for financial participation of asylum seekers in the asylum procedure, etc. - have largely accommodated the FPÖ position. - has largely accommodated the FPÖ position. Strache would like to go even further on several individual issues."
"Are there any other items missing from the Chair's programme? Yes, the question of social justice is missing because ÖVP and FPÖ don't care about it at all. That is the real question for the future of the EU. Meanwhile, the Council Presidency is concerned with the renationalisation of consumer protection, for example."
"As I said, you can take that from the Freedom Party or not. And there is also something to suggest that the FPÖ will put its flirtation with an EU exit - and this term is at any rate the basis of its previous stance - back on the agenda if the situation changes.For the essence of a populist party is that it is not so much driven by its own convictions, but adapts them to the presumed majority opinion of the citizens - or a relevant part of it."
"As has become clear and loud during the very long electoral campaign, our politicians are not only distinguished by an excess of presentism, but also by increasing doses of Euroscepticism. The Five Stars and the League are preparing for a clash with the EU precisely on the issue of the deficit. If they don't change their minds, they will go to Brussels and ask for flexibility for a massive reverse redistribution operation from the future to the present."
"As much harmony as is shown between the ÖVP and the FPÖ, it ceases to exist when it comes to EU issues, and even more so when it comes to Othmar Karas. FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had already stated that he found it difficult to imagine Karas as an EU Commissioner. On Saturday, at the FPÖ's New Year's meeting, Strache remained curt: Mr Karas is the problem of the ÖVP and not our problem."
"As the weeks go past, with more and more suggestions of dire consequences of a hard Brexit, especially in the North, it may be that some of them are having second thoughts. Again, it's somewhat ironic that Sinn Féin seems to be gaining because of its stance on Brexit. Historically, the party has trenchantly opposed any treaty or major proposal from Brussels but, on the issue of Brexit, it made a strategic decision that it was in the best interests of its political rationale to oppose the North's exit from the EU."
"At least 30% of all voters must say no before a parliamentary decision can be rejected. EU spokesman Jens Joel ( S) points out that party chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl ( DF) announced a more constructive EU policy in the autumn. No one here disputes that the court will benefit Danish business and create jobs, so it's an obvious case if the DF means something by it, says Jens Joel."

EU spokesman Jens Joel ( S) points out that party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl ( DF) announced a more constructive EU policy in the autumn. He said that now the Danish People's Party will be creative and assess from case to case.
"At the end of the long negotiations in Brussels with Rome (as with Paris, for 10 years in excessive deficit above the maximum limit of 3%, Madrid, Lisbon or Dublin), the EU led by popular and socialists (with the support of the liberals) always found a compromise. Next May's European elections could provide a reason - to the government leaders of the traditional parties - to accentuate the isolation of the M5S-Lega government precisely with the violations of EU budget constraints, provocatively claimed by the two vice-premiers, Di Maio and Salvini.Premier Giuseppe Conte and Tria seem to have realized that with Brussels it is better to deal with confidentiality, preferably involving Merkel, Macron and the other major leaders, who ultimately retain the decision-making role either directly or through the Eurogroup/Ecofin ministers."
"Austria and Slovakia seem to be the only countries for the time being that, like the Netherlands, want to make the European rules on family reunification stricter. This is evident from a tour of the member states of the European Union. For the cabinet, adjustment of the rules is of great importance because the PVV has attached its support for further cuts to them. Slovenia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic do not consider adjustments necessary, although the trio is not closing the door permanently."
BJARKE MØLLER. DF tries to convince voters and opinion leaders that it is popular to criticise the EU 49%.. say yes to Denmark joining a common EU distribution key for asylum seekers The new poll shows that people are ready to move when external crises hit.
"Bang from Brussels: The leading candidate of the European People's Party (EPP), Manfred Weber (CSU), demands that parties working against the goals of the European Union (EU) should no longer receive financial support from the EU budget. European parties whose aim is to destroy the European Union, such as the right-wing radicals of Le Pen or large parts of the AfD, should no longer receive money from European funds, Weber told WELT. Of course it was permissible to criticise Europe, the top politician went on to explain."
"Before 2400 participants, Pretzell announced that he wanted to switch to the anti-European group in the Strasbourg parliament. In future, he said, he would fight together with the Italian Lega Nord, the Austrian FPÖ and the French Front National against the supposedly overpowering EU institutions. The AfD must send a signal of unity to all parties critical of Europe. Pretzell's goal is a kind of populist international, an alliance of all those forces that want to weaken or outright abolish institutionalised Europe."
"Before the MH17 disaster, the PVV favored Russia - Geert Wilders tried to prevent his group members from being critical of Russia, De Telegraaf wrote in June. Now the PVV is actually critical of Putin. In a debate on the MH17, MP De Roon even called the EU sanctions good. UKIP"
"Berlingskes political commentator Thomas Larsen did not find many mitigating circumstances: Messerschmidts characterization can best be classified as condescending, arrogant and slightly sexist, he wrote, adding that the DF has a lot to learn about leadership if he wants to fulfill his ambition to become party leader one day. Part of the picture is that the Danish parliament, led by Morten Messerschmidt, is heading for a referendum on Denmark's EU legal reservation. And here it is no help, to say the least, that the little man's party speaks so condescendingly of the opposite sex, which also needs to be persuaded to vote no on 3 December."
"Besides the already mentioned Citizens' Committee EU, the Forum for Democracy and weblog GeenStijl, the parties involved in the Lower House are the PVV, the SP and the Party for the Animals. Of the organizations outside the House of Representatives, GeenStijl will be familiar to most people, but the same is not true of the EU Citizens' Committee and the Forum for Democracy. The citizens' committee is mainly supported by the concerned citizens Arjan van Dixhoorn and Pepijn van Houwelingen."
"Blinded by hatred we were threatening that PiS will overrule the Constitutional Tribunal, the special services and the National Bank of Poland, the State Electoral Commission, will destroy the civil service, will violate the Constitution, will destroy the division of power and the independence of the judiciary, will take over the state media and will destroy private media, will make the prosecution and the public administration party-political, will impose the tyranny of the majority without considering the rights of the minority, without respect for the letter and the spirit of the law. We threatened with the Euroscepticism of PiS, Poland's conflict with the EU and its isolation in Europe. We threatened with uncontrolled power concentrated in the hands of Jaroslaw Kaczynski."
"Blue Elephant The FPÖ is also concerned with raising border fences and isolating Austria in the EU, even though it obviously has not the slightest idea of the economic policy requirements in a globalised, closely interconnected world,"" Van der Bellen fears. Because Strache was already acting like an elephant in a European china shop by calling Germany's chancellor"
"Both in Parliament and among the people, there is a clear majority in favour of staying in the EU, but many think that cooperation is going too far, and if the British throw their fused hand grenade into the middle of the EU system, the future is hard to predict. Here Løkke will have a huge challenge to define a broadly based and forward-looking Danish EU policy. On the one hand, not only DF, but also Liberal Alliance and Conservatives will want a more EU critical line. Danish reservations are here to stay."
"Both lead parties that describe their political location as beyond right and left and whose declared goals are the abolition of the euro and the dismantling of supranational competences of the EU. And both are likely to be elected to the EU Parliament at the end of May. There is already talk that the FN could join forces with the AfD and the right-wing populists from England, Holland and other member states to sabotage the work of the other parliamentarians. Hopefully the AfDers know who they might be dealing with."
"Brexit would hamper trade and investment across Ireland. It would also remove the minimum safeguards that the EU provides and hand these powers of workers' rights to a Tory British government.Sinn Féin is campaigning vigorously against a Brexit and encouraging people to vote to Remain.A British vote to leave the European Union would have huge implications for the entire island of Ireland, and in my opinion would run counter to the democratic wishes of the Irish people."
"Britain's eventual membership is of particular interest to the Danish People's Party, which has previously demanded a referendum on whether Denmark should leave the EU at that time and seek the same membership. Still, Kenneth Kristensen Berth will not answer whether the DF would be prepared to swap Denmark's EU membership for a Canadian model. I think it's too early to say very specifically, but there should be no doubt that I would like to see as little EU as possible, so if an agreement can be negotiated that, for example, gives market access but not immediate access for people to enter Denmark, then it looks very positive, he says."
"British advances to the office of prime minister With Donald Trump's backing of Brexit and him personally.The current vice-premier and leader of the League is running for Palazzo Chigi on a sovereignist line, pushed by the number two of an American Administration that considers him a pick to unhinge the European Union, and not only. So, back from two days in Washington, Salvini immediately relaunches the tax cut as a duty."

"Brussels. The attack by Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) on the EU border and coast guard Frontex during his visit to Brussels has drawn harsh criticism from MEPs of the coalition partner ÖVP. Strache's statement that Frontex is engaged in legal trafficking puzzles him, said ÖVP security spokesman Heinz Becker in a statement."
"But according to him, the worm is (...) in the fruit from the end of 2015, when the former megretists, among whom Marine Le Pen's brother-in-law, Philippe Olivier, became her adviser, return in force to the FN and influence their leader on the euro. In 2018, this current (of the ""right outside the walls"", more identitarian and less social, editor's note) is in power in the FN, where criticism of the European Union is increasingly disappearing, along with social issues,"" the sovereignist politician accused.What facilitated such a change of foot in the FN is a renunciation: the renunciation of victory, which I felt in Marine Le Pen after the second round, concludes the political leader, who does not spare his former colleagues either -- the leadership of the FN is a universe of laziness."
"But is this all just a problem of the Easterners ? Not at all, as one can say after the great successes of the right-wing populists, such as the People's Party in Denmark or the FPÖ in Vienna after a forced Islamophobic election campaign. Just like Marine Le Pen's Front National, which leads the far-right group in the EU Parliament (of which the FPÖ is a member), they are not inferior to some leaders in Eastern Europe in terms of EU scepticism. What they have in common is a certain admiration for the autocratic Russian President Vladimir Putin."
"But of course the most tasteful quotes from Banas - that we have a supposedly free and independent Poland, that whoever disagrees with it [the authorities] can be arrested and convicted on the basis of slander and that we have a pure police state ruled by the services, not by the prime minister, president or parliament - was not the case. Surprisingly, the News omitted the Constitutional Tribunal's hearing on the PiS's arch-important issue of whether one can disobey the rulings of the Court of Justice of the EU (it's that hearing with Pawlowicz in the lead role).-- unless, reading between the strips of news - right now, the narrative about PiS fighting the EU invading our sovereignty is not useful to Kaczynski."
But the 500 or so delegates who will not decide on the election programme until Sunday or even Monday are considered difficult to calculate. Delegate Georg Hock received great applause for saying that the AfD must be a demolition company of the EU. It must become a resistance movement without false distancing.
"But the Greens, as the global rescue party, should also have something to say about the EU budget summit? Wrong. On their homepage, they still welcome the ECJ ruling on data protection agreements between the EU and the USA. No prominent word on the summit meeting in Brussels.Surprisingly, the FPÖ does not use the opportunity on its homepage, which may be favourable for them, to criticise Europe. Instead, under the photo of a worried-looking Klubobmann Herbert Kickl, it warns against price gouging - milk, cheese and eggs cost three per cent more in June than in the previous year, meat even 6.1 per cent."
"But there was no let-up in the EU scepticism when party leader Anders Samuelsen held an election party at Christiansborg last night: It would not have ended with a 'no' vote if the Liberal Alliance had not recommended a 'no' vote, said Anders Samuelsen from the rostrum, adding: Liberal voters need to hear that there is a liberal party that shares their concerns about the attempt to tamper with the constitution. That there are others than the Danish People's Party, Enhedslisten and the People's Movement against the EU, who are no-voters. Here is a bourgeois-liberal who takes the starting point: what is right from a Danish point of view?"
"But to appreciate the full significance of these political perversions of reality, one should read a book published 70 years ago that made history: 1984 by George Orwell, in which the picture is drawn of a totalitarian state that has re-evaluated all concepts: Thoughtcrime , for which one can be arrested even before committing a crime , by the thought police . The concepts are re-evaluated: ignorance is strength. Thus Kickl simply turns reception centres into exit centres. At the same time, in 1984 the past is constantly being rewritten against all evidence. Today: When the FPÖ EU candidate Vilimsky is confronted on ORF with a pro-Exit statement, he simply says it wasn't him.The highest level in 1984 is reached when people not only accept but really believe the absolute absurdity, the most audacious lie of power (the Party): two times two is five ( double think )."
"But what the chancellor hears from Kaczynski, she is unlikely to like. This is because the views of the Law and Justice president on the future of the EU are at odds with his ideas.Kaczynski wants to weaken EU institutions and strengthen the role of nation states, among others."
"But when Britain votes in June on a new deal negotiated by Prime Minister David Cameron with the European Commission, the EU suddenly becomes complicated for the Danish People's Party. For in Britain it is not just reservations about the EU, but membership itself that is at stake.DF has in recent years positioned itself closely with the British Conservatives in Europe. DENMARK AND THE EU Growing EU scepticism in Europe strengthens the Danish People's Party, but if it leads Britain out of the EU, it also gives the party a problem."
"But where are the real issues for the future? The liberal economic think tank Agenda Austria writes: The government has not announced any measures to make the state pension system financially sustainable. The promise to relieve the burden on workers by abolishing the cold progression is not kept either. EU policy fluctuates between Kurz's assurances that the coalition partner is pro-European anyway and the implied actions of the FPÖ to link up with the extreme right-wing parties in Europe that want to destroy the EU.Wwhat the Republic is to become in the next ten or 15 years is something of which little or nothing can be heard, even from the derouted opposition (SPÖ, Greens), with the small exception of the Neos."
"But, now, with the prospect of entering power becomes a reality they ditch its opposition to the courts. It is not the first time and certainly will not be the last time Sinn Féin will drop a long-held policy. This is the same party that voted against every EU referendum until Brexit. It also wasn't that long ago that it wanted to increase corporation tax rate to 17.5pc before changing its position to the 12.5pc status quo."
"Campaigning The Ulster Unionist Party meanwhile has confirmed that it will be campaigning to remain in the EU ahead of the referendum on June 23rd. The DUP, TUV and Ukip are backing a Brexit, while Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party are in favour of remaining within the EU. Separately at the Alliance Party's annual conference on Saturday, its leader David Ford accused other Northern Ireland Executive parties of delay, fudge and waffle."
"Can we then find in the refusal of immigration a common trait of Europhobic parties? This is true for far-right parties such as the FN, the Danish People's Party, the Swedish Democrats, or the British Ukip, but not for ""centrist"" sovereignist parties such as the German AfD, the Polish KNP, or even for the Italian Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement (17 MEPs), which is classified more to the left. Finally, there are the divisions that stem from the image of the parties and explain their difficulties in forming a parliamentary group: Ukip refuses to ally itself with far-right formations such as the FN, and the latter finds parties such as the Greek Golden Dawn or the Hungarian Jobbik decidedly unattractiveBref, you can find everything in this Europhobic cauldron."
Chancellor Kern's initiative in the press interview and the dispute between Vienna and Ankara are also making waves at the European level. EU Commission PresidentAustria is the centre of the radical racism dispute with Turkey.
"Christian Democrats in the European Parliament spoke of Britain's retreat and see mainly electoral motives with Cameron. The Socialists and Greens called the speech an attempt to blackmail the EU.In the Netherlands, the largest opposition parties PVV and SP reacted positively. 'Also the Dutch people deserve a referendum, Prime Minister Rutte,' tweeted PVV leader Geert Wilders."
"Citizens calls for leadership and the United States of Europe. Albert Rivera judged as historical irresponsibility the call for the referendum by David Cameron and bet on strengthening Spain's leadership in a more integrated EU. We can decide a Government that leads in Europe, or that asks for permission and pass; support populisms, or that opportunity and illusion win, he said in relation to the PP and Podemos, respectively. That third way that we represent can bring solutions and steps forward in Europe."
"Citizens supported the suspension of the rules, although they also demanded that it be accompanied by a plan to balance the public accounts. Among the most usual partners of the Government, the wish that the end of austerity does not remain a mere parenthesis and that the EU decides to relax its fiscal rules was repeatedly heard. This was requested by left-wing groups such as Unidas Podemos, ERC or EH Bildu, but also, very clearly, by the PNV through its deputy Idoia Sagastizabal.Sprinkled by light"

"Clearly, because the PiS mortgage is extremely loaded on this issue. The party opposes deepening EU integration, although today it is clear that there should be more EU, not less. PiS does not leave a dry thread on PO for its 2009-10 rapprochement with Russia, but it does not sprinkle its head of ashes for the words of its president in 2011: I am deeply convinced that the day will come when we will have a Budapest in Warsaw.God be on guard for Poland, for we would be in awe if today the Polish prime minister received Putin in Warsaw as Viktor Orbán did in Budapest."
"Climate protection has never been high on the political agenda for the Freedom Party. There is nothing to suggest that this will change in the run-up to the EU elections - the FPÖ has not yet decided on an election programme.With one action, however, the Blue MEPs around the current top candidate Harald Vilimsky sent a sensational signal on climate policy in 2016: they were the only Austrian party to refuse to vote in favour of the Paris global climate treaty."
"Commission to Morawiecki: withdraw request from TK What could be the consequences of the ECJ ruling that key EU principles are unconstitutional? According to the case law of the Constitutional Tribunal before PiS took control of it, Poland will have three options: change the constitution, seek to change EU law, or leave the EU. Experts point out that a further deepening of the conflict with EU bodies is more likely, however."
"Comparisons between Syriza and Sinn Féin are blinding the FG/Labour Coalition to Ireland's national interest in this serious spat between Germany and Greece. Sinn Féin, unlike Syriza, is an anti-EU party; at every EU referendum, it has cemented its Eurosceptic credentials in advocating No votes.Instead of doffing the cap to Merkel, we should sympathise with the difficulties of peoples' pain in enduring a troika bailout."
"Consider remarks made last month by the former president of the European Commission, Italy's Romano Prodi. The former economics professor told the newspaper Quotidiano Nazionale: 'France, Italy and Spain should together pound their fists on the table, but they are not doing so because they delude themselves that they can go it alone.' Here too, we delude ourselves that we can go it alone, Sinn Féin.It is astonishing that such a champion of the European Union should adopt such a Eurosceptic tone.It echoes the assertion of Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz that 'the euro may have to be abandoned for the sake of salvaging the European project'."
"Continental partners are lauded here for their solidarity towards the State over the past three years, and the argument that Brexit will inevitably be followed by Irexit is one that emanates almost exclusively from English Brexiteers, not a group renowned for their nuanced understanding of Irish life. The manifestos of the mainstream parties this election season were solidly pro-European; even Sinn Féin and the Green Party, consistent opponents of EU treaties in the past, offer policy platforms that are broadly reconciled with the EU's role and structure, and Ireland's place within it. There will be a clutch of anti-EU candidates on ballot papers around the country today, but they will be among the first to be eliminated when counting begins."
Contradictions The voters voted RN in the European elections. Either.
"Curiously enough, it is precisely the three parties that a few years ago opposed the tightening of the Public Access Act that are now feeling the consequences of it. Netop EL, LA and DF are also outside the EU negotiations.Prime Minister Peter Skaarup (DF) sees the Public Access Act as an expression of the fact that some parties have agreed to be able to go and fiddle with some things, and that is why they voted for the Public Access Act."
"D66 has been ostentatiously opposing the PVV for years. During the General Considerations, Pechtold added a dimension: alleged extreme-right contacts of the PVV. Last Sunday he added yet another dimension: clashing visions of the EU. Pechtold cleverly exploited VVD MP Verheyen's comment that pro-EU politicians would be more dangerous than Marine Le Pen."
"DF has in recent years placed itself close to the British Conservatives in Europe. DENMARK AND THE EU Growing EU scepticism in Europe strengthens the Danish People's Party, but if it leads Britain out of the EU, it also gives the party a problem.Now, however, the British may be going where the DF has set the limit in relation to the EU."

Where scepticism turns into outright resistance."
"DF part of Nigel Farage's problem It is the Danish People's Party, among others, that has helped to complicate the life of Nigel Farage, whose group Morten Messerschmidt has so far been part of. Instead of joining Farage, the Danish People's Party, Alternative for Germany (AfD) and several other parties have agreed to become part of the more moderate Eurosceptics in the ECR group.Here sit not least the members of the Conservative party in government in Great Britain."
DF rejects that the EU should interfere in how the Danish labour market is organised. It shows how rotten the EU system is.In the Danish People's Party we don't care about the EU. They just need to stay out of what we're doing here at home.
"DF's speech warms more than listening to Thorning, Bjarne and Østergaard's arrogant statements about the competition state and the 'that's the way it is' policy. The Social Democrats' and Radicals' support for Brussels' black economic austerity policies and the EU's anti-worker principle of borderless wage suppression is sending workers straight into the arms of the DF.The top leadership of the Social Democrats seems to have more confidence in their officials and spreadsheets in the ministry than in the experience and trust of thousands of party comrades on the ground in municipalities, workplaces and voluntary associations."
"Damage for Austria Freund called on Andreas Mölzer to resign after his comparison between the EU and the Third Reich. With his statements, the FPÖ top candidate had not only harmed himself, but also Austria."
"Dangerous nationalism Geert Wilders and his PVV want a referendum on a departure of the Netherlands from the EU (Trouw, June 25). He calls it a liberation from the EU."
"Denmark cannot yet participate in EU cooperation in these areas because we still have a legal reservation. But when a referendum is held before March 2016 on replacing the legal reservation with an opt-in system, Denmark will have the opportunity to opt out of EU asylum and immigration policy.This is unlikely to happen, as S, V, K, R and SF, fearing the DF's campaign machine, have already decided in advance that the EU should stay out of Danish immigration policy. However, the new survey shows that the majority of voters are far more pragmatic than the elites imagine."
"Denmark's obligations to the Schengen cooperation and free movement within the EU are, according to Denmark's future prime minister, blocking the Danish People's Party's wish, Lars Løkke explained. EU law blocks the DF's demand for permanent border controls, says Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V). Four years ago, his government concluded just the opposite."
"Denmark's relationship with the EU has long been one of the major sticking points blocking government cooperation between the Danish People's Party and the Left. EU AGREEMENT It will not take a new general election to see the Danish People's Party in government if the party can agree with the Left on a common EU line after the referendum, says the DF leader.-- But if a majority of voters votes against transforming the legal reservation into an opt-in system, it may be easier for the Danish People's Party and the Left to agree on Denmark's relationship with the EU, the DF leader estimates."
"Denmark, in turn, is invited to one of three annual summits of eurozone leaders. --EU sceptics in the Danish People's Party and the Greens believe that a referendum is needed to say yes to the pact. But Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (S), who has a majority with the Left and Conservatives, rejects this."

"Despite the fact that the European Court of Justice has ruled in 2011 and 2013 that, according to the outgoing government, Denmark cannot maintain previous requirements for a certain period of employment or residence in Denmark. The Danish People's Party met yesterday with the presumably future Prime Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V), to explore the possibilities of a government cooperation, where the Danish People's Party has a more sceptical EU line as one of their main demands.However, according to Deputy Chairman of the Danish People's Party Peter Skaarup, the Danish People's Party's EU scepticism also matches the higher priorities among Danes."
"During a coffee break, Barth gets into conversation with Peter Mühlbach, 58, a local landlord. He says he will vote in the EU elections for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall: the AfD. Because it was the only party against the EU's Russia sanctions."
EU exit The Free List Austria (around the Salzburg FPÖ rebel Karl Schnell) is surprised that proponents of the referendum for an EU exit recommend voting for the FPÖ. The Freedom Party is no guarantee that there will be a referendum on leaving the EU.+++

"EU power increases while citizen support decreases. The only thing that can engage a country's citizens is that they feel their interests or self-determination threatened by a distant power, as the EU is today.MORTEN MESSERSCHMIDT, DF.CITIZENS don't think politicians tell them enough about the EU."
"EU scepticism The further question of whether the European Union will still exist in 100 years is answered in the negative by 45 per cent (again to a particularly high degree by FPÖ voters) and in the affirmative by only 38 per cent. It is above all young and more highly educated respondents who believe in the continued existence of the EU - these two groups, by the way, with a clear majority. And: Those who are proud to be Austrians are very likely to believe that Austria will continue to exist as it has in the past and at the same time sceptical that the same applies to the EU."
"EVEN IF 1968 lost both to itself and to the rest of society, these basic ideas had a strong impact, not least in the detached houses. There turned out to be a very short time from the opposition of the 68's to the EC to that of their political heirs in the Danish People's Party, and it is no coincidence that EU-scepticism today runs in lockstep from the Danish People's Party to the Enhedslisten.They have common roots and common ideas, even if the former dream of a Denmark cut off from the world and the latter of a Denmark in a borderless world."
"Enacting this scenario, Tusk would have, we hear from a person from his circle, first come out with an appeal to all opposition forces in Poland to present a list of authorities who, being in the EP, would by themselves manage to improve Poland's image in the European Union. The argument would be the narration that Poland's place in Europe is endangered, so whoever wants to stay in the EU should support Tusk's pro-European list. That is: whoever is against PiS, hands on deck.There is more than one problem with implementing such a scenario."
"Enhedslisten expects Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen to respect the no vote and start discussions on a new EU policy. As the only 'no' party in the red bloc, Enhedslisten will give a voice to the left-wing EU-scepticism. The Danish People's Party is more concrete and demands a new EU agreement in which the traditional ambition of the Peerage to move closer to the EU is deleted.Here is an immediate rejection of the negative side."

Establishment PVV member Marcel de Graaff was already in Parliament and will return as the only PVV member once the Brexit is a reality after disastrous elections. De Graaff is now allowed to rest for a few months on retainer.
"European politics weakened the AfD because internally a hard rejection of the EU was allowed to become an informal common sense. This was reflected in the election programme in the following sentence: ""If our fundamental reform approaches cannot be realised in the existing system of the EU within a reasonable period of time, we consider it necessary for Germany to leave. This Dexit option was hardly communicable in the election campaign because of the London Brexit chaos. Likewise the drastic AfD demand for the dissolution of the European Parliament.In addition, the AfD did not clear up its donation scandals involving party leader Jörg Meuthen, parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel and European candidate Guido Reil (second on the list)."
"Even if Kenneth Kristensen Berth is not in the party leadership, the post of EU spokesman gives him a central position when it comes to defining the party's line on the big issue, which is at the same time a huge opportunity and an enormous uncertainty for the Danish People's Party. Majority of DF voters want out of EU Several in the party admit off the record that there has been scattered fencing and some doubt about position on the issue of future membership of the EU, which along with the issue of immigration has been the overriding theme of the Danish People's Party since its foundation in 1995. In February, MEP Morten Messerschmidt declared that for the first time ever he could recommend a yes to the EU, and as recently as March he wrote that it must be in the Danish interest to appeal to the British to stay. But the strategy of recommending or merely hoping for a yes vote proved, according to one DF source, downright dangerous for the party, whose voters are largely not just sceptical of the EU, but opposed to it."
"Even if the DF will stand firm on its most central 2025 demands, a key DF source says that in disputes such as Europol, where the party, unlike the government, rejects full membership, it is likely to find it harder to stand firm in a negotiating situation. So will the EU case remain a problem for the Danish People's Party in the long term? Not necessarily.During Pia Kjærsgaard's leadership, it was not unusual for the party to receive support from around 15 percent of voters."
"Even more sceptical is the Danish People's Party, which has declared that it wants to form a bourgeois government after the next elections. For decades, EU policy has been perhaps the biggest contradiction between the DF and the V - and EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth (DF) is not exactly clapping his hands: Civic-minded Danes have long realised that the EU is a colossus on clay feet that can only be saved by artificial respiration.It has become too big, unpopular and about too much."
"Even the guarantor of the 5 Star Movement, Beppe Grillo, criticized the European institutions: Charlie Gard is not clinically dead, his parents do not want the machines that keep him alive to be turned off, they will even go away! A journey of courage and hope: a music that finds merchant's ears in this insipid and soulless europette. It is a murder with the complicity, also this time, of the EU that is silent, commented the secretary of the Northern League, Matteo Salvini.© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
"Even though almost half of the town voted for Kristian Thulesen Dahl in the parliamentary elections last June, several Thyregod residents are harshly critical. DF-FORMAND PORTRAIT The case of possible misuse of EU funds hits DF chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl hard on the values that brought him to the top: orderliness and thoroughness. Internally, the party is unsure whether the storm can be weathered."
"Even though the country is plagued by problems, especially with boat refugees from Africa, Italy is not willing to let other countries take over some of its border control. The Danish People's Party certainly does not look favourably on the idea. EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth calls it an encroachment on the competence of nation states: It is the nation states themselves who, in our best opinion, should decide how much or how little they should guard their borders. EU spokesman Peter Hummelgaard (S) believes that Fogh Rasmussen is right in his basic analysis that there is a huge problem with the control of the external borders."
"FOR THE SECOND, the government is afraid that the EU-scepticism represented by the Liberal Alliance will have a great impact. Bourgeois EU sceptics have so far had only one place to go: the Danish People's Party, which many have felt disgusted by because of the party's patronising rhetoric in the immigration debate.With the Liberal Alliance, these people have a decent bourgeois party to identify with."
"FPÖ serves other strata of the electorate. One reason for the clearly different attitudes towards the EU is, of course, the respective electorates of the ÖVP and the FPÖ.How compatible are the ÖVP and the FPÖ for the presidency? Differences."
"FPÖ: Right of centre-right At the time of the coalition talks, it was already a major fear of the FPÖ: What if you are worn out as a junior partner in the government? The EU election is a first, cautious answer to whether this is really the case. Kurz presents himself as a presentable representative of the centre-right."
"Fact is: Salvini boasts to his voters as a strong man, uses his power to close ports, to keep out all migrants if possible (59% of Italians are in favour). Salvini shows up the European Union and the German government. In Germany, the AfD could benefit from this: The refugee issue predictably mobilises AfD supporters who like Salvini's tough stance. The latter's party, the Lega, sits in a parliamentary group with the AfD in the new European Parliament."
"Factually, it has already happened in several cases, the professor believes. As an example, he mentions the debate on so-called welfare tourism in Denmark, where the Left and the Danish People's Party are pressuring the government. In France, it is Le Pen who is pressuring the traditional parties, in Belgium it is Flemish nationalists, and we also see it in Sweden, Finland and Germany. In those places, the traditional right is becoming more radical on the issue of free movement because they are afraid of the far right, he says."
"Farage is not helped by the fact that the British press is again reporting that the party leader has received almost 2 million kroner from the taxpayer to rent an office, which he allegedly received for free. DF part of Nigel Farage's problem It is the Danish People's Party, among others, that has helped to complicate the life of Nigel Farage, whose group Morten Messerschmidt has so far been part of.Instead of joining Farage, the Danish People's Party, Alternative for Germany (AfD) and several other parties have agreed to become part of the more moderate Eurosceptics in the ECR group."

"Fear of Covid makes people forget about the migrant problem. And the 200 billion offered by the European Union to Italy re-evaluates Europeanism. Matteo Salvini, who built the League's success on opposition to migrants and Europe, now finds himself without ammunition. Is this the end of populist sovereignty, or the beginning of the end, or is it just a momentary ebb? Gianfranco Orta Dear Gianfranco,"
"Few days earlier the Danish People's Party was clearly more happy with the Social Democrats than with the Left. Following the voters' rejection on Thursday evening of the Japanese parties' wish to replace the legal reservation with an opt-in system, the Liberal Party's foreign minister, Kristian Jensen, was clear in his rejection of the Danish People's Party, which demanded that the Japanese parties' agreement on the basic EU course be terminated. When we have a settlement, we stick to it."
"Fianna Fáil's European candidate for Midlands-North West, Brendan Smith, said the fact the Brexit Party was using her commentary as propaganda should not come as a surprise. Anyone who has listened to Sinn Féin's anti-EU rhetoric over the past 45 years knows where they stand on the European project, he said.For those who have listened to the party's recent claims to be pro-European, the emergence of this video is a timely reminder of the real values at the heart of Sinn Féin."
"Finally, there are still strictly political issues, i.e. the question of Poland's future in the European Union. Even after the TK verdict, which gave Polish law primacy over the EU law, nobody will throw us out of the EU. We will not leave the EU by ourselves either, because contrary to popular opinion PiS knows that Poland gains a lot from its membership in the EU (The thing is that Brussels will never agree to such a thing. Especially after Brexit, when EU cohesion is a major priority."
"Five years ago in an editorial position we wrote: We predicted then, and since then we have shown almost every day what a scandal is the power that wipes its mouth with Poland, but despises the Polish raison d'etat. Prime Minister Morawiecki insults the European Union in the Sejm in the style of Nigel Farage.There was supposed to be Budapest, there is Minsk.November 18 PiS power took Poles on a journey to the East, far from Europe. Another act played out today PiS wants to reject the most ambitious EU program for Poland since the Marshall Plan."
"For European nationalists, Trump has been a powerful ally, especially in Hungary and Poland. Poland's ruling Law and Justice party threatens Germany, questions EU migration policy and stifles judicial independence. Until now - even despite criticism from their European partners - Polish authorities have felt confident because they believed Trump would defend their country, for example."
"For a right-wing populist opposition politician who has also been a member of the EU Parliament since 2014, this would soon have been forgotten. He is also vice-president of the ENF group in the EU Parliament, which he founded with the former Front National leader Marine Le Pen, in the midst of extreme right-wing parties, where until recently Italy's Lega interior minister Matteo Salvini also worked: Juncker and his EU integration policy have always been an enemy image to these EU sceptics.The problem: The FPÖ is now in a government that holds the EU Council presidency. Vilimsky has not made the role change."
"For her part, Marine Le Pen is still trying to show that the FN's European project has nothing to do with the exit from the euro that she advocated during the presidential election. The disaster of the debate between the two rounds against Macron made the far-right party understand that it had to forget about a Frexit that did not say its name in order to promote a Europe of Nations and change the EU from within. The FN now calls itself European but not Europeanist. And we try to talk about civilisation."
"For the Danish People's Party, however, it will be crucial to rethink the public sector, otherwise the party will not be able to deliver on the promises it has made to its voters. That is why the renewal of the public sector will be the Danish People's Party's agenda, and in 2030 the Danish People's Party and the Alternative Party will be the overwhelming welfare parties.Last but not least, the EU will be dead and gone in 2030. Both the financial crisis and the refugee crisis have exposed the EU as completely incompetent, unable to handle the crises, and what use is the EU at all? None! The EU has undermined its own role and credibility. Nobody wants to pay for bureaucratic hell and global dumping, and when the EU has even shown itself to be useless when the shit hits the fan, it has dug its own grave."
"For the Left it poses a problem. Lars Løkke Rasmussen ( V) is nervous about scaring away crucial middle voters if the Danish People's Party takes over the ministerial offices. POLITICAL ANALYSIS DF's ministerial dreams grow in tandem with bourgeois EU scepticism.Until now, the Left Party has had the clear excuse that it could not sit in government with the Danish People's Party, because EU policy divides."
"For the essence of a populist party is that it is not so much driven by its own convictions, but adapts them to the presumed majority opinion of the citizens - or a relevant part of it. So if it seems opportune again to talk about leaving the EU, the FPÖ would possibly be at the forefront again.In any case, it was not opportune in this presidential run-off."
"For the first time since the fall of authoritarian regimes in Europe, a European country is facing a real coup d'état aimed at disrespecting the verdict of the ballot box and institutionally muzzling democracy. The FN said in a statement: ""We must obviously see behind this coup de force the hand of Brussels, the financial markets and Germany.Italian President Sergio Mattarella is set to nominate Carlo Cottarelli, the embodiment of fiscal austerity, to lead the country into new elections on Monday, after vetoing a clearly eurosceptic populist government on Sunday."
"For the moment we are left with the reality that Northern unionists never 'got' the EU project, despite the 56pc majority in favour of Remain. That is in marked contrast to people in the Republic who have long ago seen the EU's many potential benefits.On the Nationalist side Sinn Féin have a ways to go to catch up with the SDLP, whose founder John Hume, borrowed heavily from Franco-German post-World War II reconciliation to imagine a Northern Ireland peace settlement. But like many other things, Sinn Féin has backed away from anti-EU policies which once matched Maggie Thatcher's Tories at their worst."
"For the moment, Vox has not gone that far. Although the hashtag #Spaxit has become popular among its supporters on social networks, the leaders of the ultra party have not dared to openly propose Spain's exit from the EU.On the contrary, the program with which Vox contested the European elections last May 26 began: In Vox we emphatically affirm our Europeanist vocation. We believe in Europe because we are Europe."
"For this EU Commission, whose term ends in just over a year, there are political reasons to explore the spaces for compromise. The main one is that it does not want to turn a possible break with Italy into a tool in the hands of the League and M5S for the campaign for the European elections in May 2019. There is also a sense in Brussels of an all-European reason for wanting to avoid this eventuality: in more or less formal agreement with Viktor Orbán's Hungarian MPs, the French Ressemblement (formerly Front) National, the Germans of Alternative für Deutschland, the Poles of Law and Justice, and various others, Lega and M5S can now try to build in the European Parliament a Eurosceptic opposition to the moderate populars, socialists, greens, and liberals. If that opposition is extensive and cohesive enough, it can cripple the agenda of today's winning forces."
"For us it just doesn't harmonize that well. Denmark cannot be part of the EU and say no to the principle of free movement of labour. Is the Danish People's Party ready to vote Denmark out of the EU? In the first instance, our wish is to try to reform this system. There is a dangerous shortage of hands in some sectors."
"For years, the way we have acted has encouraged illegal immigration and is the best help that smugglers can hope for (...) sometimes with the complicity of a number of NGOs,"" Marine Le Pen continued. The RN president refuted the idea that the peak of migrant arrivals in the EU had been reached in 2015, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). It's not true that there is a lot of pressure and it's going to accelerate,"" said the RN leader, for whom France reached the peak in asylum applications in 2017."
"Foreign Affairs and Brexit Handing responsibility for the Irish approach on Brexit to Sinn Féin would be on a par with Theresa May's reliance with the DUP in Westminster. Aside from the fact it would further strain Anglo-Irish relations, Sinn Féin has a long history of being anti-EU. That stance has softened in recent times and representatives now describe themselves as 'Euro-critical'."
"Forgotten like the South Burgenland as a whole, as many no, all South Burgenlanders think. In fact, there is something highly ironic about the fact that in the 2015 election campaign, from the cuddly left wing of the SPÖ to the right fringe of the FPÖ, the southern Burgenland once again had to be used as a target for EU monstrosities.Helpful misery"
"Franco Frattini (who in recent days had spoken with the Chevalier, and on which is making a strong pressure on the secretary Angelino Alfano because it does not abandon the parent company) from yesterday entered, say his, in a press silence, waiting to hear the speech that Monti will do as soon as they are dissolved Chambers. But not before giving an interview to Radio Capital. In which he said in essence that it will be inevitable that I leave if the line of the League on the EU passes. Adding not to share the dismantling of the Monti agenda."
"French National Unity leader Marine Le Pen recently announced at a rally in Belgium that she sees room in the Eurosceptic ENF faction for politicians from the Law and Justice party after the EP elections. It turns out that it is even able to understand PiS's sceptical stance towards Russia. The leader of the League of Polish Families, Matteo Salvini, constantly sends friendly signals to Novgorod and has even visited Jaroslaw Kaczynski's office.What is PiS's view on European issues? Several leaders of PiS know that in fact the best and the way of Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Poland, is to be in the main centre-right party EPP."
"From Greece in the south to Finland in the north, Eurosceptic parties stand to gain big ground when 400 million voters put together the new European Parliament next month. In France, right-wing politician Marine Le Pen is thundering against the EU and is expected to get up to 20 percent of the vote.In Denmark, Vote Watch, like others, predicts that the Danish People's Party could become the largest party - ahead of both the Social Democrats and the Left. Even the otherwise pro-EU Germans are about to send a sceptical party into parliament, Alternative for Germany, which wants a break with the euro."

"German politicians who demand this are not Europeans, they are hasbarians. They are putting the EU at risk. They make the anti-Europeans strong in their own country; as is well known, the AfD only came into being in the euro crisis. The European leagues have learned nothing from this."
"Guests and hosts are scheduled to talk in two sessions closed to the media. First about what Europe is supposed to be: United States of Europe or EU of European nations, then: How to defend the rights of member states in the EU?. The parties invited by PiS are strongly Eurosceptic, advocating a Europe of Homelands. - These are conventional titles for roundtable discussions."
"Haimbuchner, currently deputy leader of the Blue Party, does not believe that he has to become party leader in order to help shape the FPÖ. He caused controversy within the party when he called for the FPÖ to distance itself from the AfD and Marine Le Pen (Rassemblement National) because of their anti-EU stance. Retrospectively, contradictions also emerged."
Haimbuchner: The FPÖ is a pro-European and not an anti-European or even EU-exit party. But it must be possible in a democracy to criticise European institutions or undemocratic processes.
"Halla-aho, on the other hand, has tried to appear moderate. For example, he said, it would not be worth holding a referendum on EU membership now, because there is no support for it. Mr Halla-aho has also appeased his government partners by saying that he is not calling for changes to the government programme and that he himself is not seeking a ministerial post. Unlike Terho, however, he has made it clear that former President Timo Soini's position as Foreign Minister is not a foregone conclusion."

"Having finally understood that the line of integral sovereignism had killed its second rounds from 2015 (regional elections) to 2017, it is making a pure identity-immigration comeback, explains historian Nicolas Lebourg. The European Parliament's Nicolas Bay, who has been nominated to lead the RN list for the European elections, admitted on RFI that the question of the euro's viability was a long-term one.It's complicated for the RN to say that it's easy to leave the EU when the Brexit is not really a success,"" says Mr. Gauthier."
"He lists four crucial points on which the party stands firm: According to the Danish People's Party, public growth must increase by 0.8 percent in order to maintain welfare levels. Integration policy must be returned to the 2011 level, border controls must be reintroduced, and in relation to the EU, the DF will maintain the Danish reservations and at the same time demand referendums on treaty changes and the admission of new member countries.Thulesen Dahl estimates that the party will have the greatest influence as a support party for a bourgeois government."
"He questions why she doesn't advocate Ireland leaving the EU since Sinn Féin has been a long-time critic of the union. Mr Browne puts it to her that it used to be Sinn Féin policy to cut and run, adding this would help ensure there was no hard Border after Brexit.It used to be in 1972, it's not in 2018, Ms McDonald replied."
"He said he was not in a position to estimate potential legal costs, and called on TDs and senators to vote on it by the end of the year at the latest. In slightly testy exchanges with some TDs and senators, Mr Varadkar spoke against the rise of nationalistic forces and accused Sinn Féin of being anti-free trade.Your party has voted and campaigned against every single EU treaty ever, Mr Varadkar told Sinn Féin Galway TD Mairéad Farrell.I think there's a wider philosophical objection to multilateralism here, and the investor court system is just the one that's arising at the moment."
"He says that the Danish People's Party has succeeded in including it in the vote, so that what long looked like a sure yes, ended up with a no. Immigration fears interact with EU scepticism. We see this with Marine Le Pen in France, Nigel Farage in Britain and with the Danish People's Party. It is not strange. There has been a major crisis in which the major parties have not been able to unite the frustrations of the population, says Bjarke Møller."
"He travelled to the Parliament's second seat in Strasbourg for the occasion, applauding the trade pact as a blueprint for the future. But the deal has split Irish MEPs, with Independent Marian Harkin warning it was part of a perfect storm gathering over the beef sector, alongside Brexit and other EU trade deals.Ms Harkin vote against the deal, as did Sinn Féin's three EU deputies and Independents Nessa Childers and Luke Ming Flanagan. Fine Gael's four MEPs voted in favour."
"He would aim to maintain the support of the majority of MEPs (made up of his Europopulars with the Euro-socialists and the Euro-liberals), who approved his nomination, taking political responsibility for it. Juncker has budgeted for the usual heavy criticism expected from the oppositions, starting from the Front National of the French Marine Le Pen (with whom Matteo Salvini's League is allied), from the Ukip of the British Nigel Farage (allied with M5S) and from the extreme left led by the Spanish Podemos..© RESERVED REPRODUCTION"
"Helle Walther, Sct. Olai Gade 14, Helsingør: It is the height of hypocrisy, when you can read that Morten Messerschmidt (DF), who opposes the EU and thunders about it at every opportunity, has nothing against using EU funds to lead his own and DF's election campaign in 2013. As it is, the DF has broken the rules with their election campaign sailing by schooner in Danish waters.The evidence is not in dispute."
"Hence the wish of a part of the regional hemicycle, especially the socialists and ecologists, to go through with the decentralisation of these European funds, leaving the State aside. This is not entirely shared by the LR/CPNT group and even less so by the RN.The Brexit noteThe other threat to these European funds is at the source. The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could lead to a budgetary reshuffle that would be detrimental to the Common Agricultural Policy on the one hand, and to the cohesion funds on the other."
"Here the DF introduces an uncharacteristic distinction between itself and the population. 'We' did not refer to the Danish People's Party, but to the Danes, explains Berth. Not everyone got that during the EU campaign. In other words: The DF intends to leave it up to the Japanese to call the eventual referendum that will allow Danes to continue participating in Europol."
"Here the two party leaders do not even rule out going into government together. POLITICS The economic policy of the DF has much in common with the red bloc. But everything from the EU to the environment and climate to foreigners and integration has the potential for major divisions.The starting point for the two party leaders' joint action is not least the common opposition to a higher retirement age, which constitutes just one of several points within the distribution policy, where the Danish People's Party has more in common with the red bloc than the blue."
"Hinkley Point is the first new nuclear power plant to be built in the UK in decades and is part of the plan to replace older reactors that are due to be decommissioned in the next few years. Other countries and actors also want to take legal action against the EU Commission's green light for subsidies. Environmental protection organisations, the FPÖ and the Greens welcomed the Austrian government's move. The lawsuit is a decisive step against the resurgence of the nuclear industry in Europe , said Alexander Egit, executive director of Greenpeace."
"His efforts to smear Matt Carthy failed and now he seeks to do the same to Mary Lou McDonald. To say that Sinn Féin and the Brexit Party could have any common ground is laughable, the spokesman said.The Fianna Fáil TD recently accused Mr Carthy's campaign of being a lie because he plans to run the next Dáil even if he is re-elected as an MEP."
"His real influence on the European issue may be exaggerated, some analysts argue. Firstly, Ukip is not just driven by Euroscepticism. While the British National Party, the local National Front, is unpalatable,The British system means that Ukip has very little chance of being elected to Westminster."
"Home in Denmark, the DF rejects giving the EU system more tools, while criticizing the system for not being able to meet the challenges we face. But how can the EU improve if countries do not want to give it the tools it needs? The DF is using contradictory arguments here, calling the EU an undemocratic rat race, but at the same time not wanting to give the EU more democratic tools.Man might suspect that the DF is deliberately working against a functioning system, so that they can later complain about the result."

"Home, the ruling Left Party has so far been reluctant to support new pan-European solutions to the problem, but ahead of an emergency EU ministerial meeting on the refugee situation on 14 September, the party is set to support the proposal from the three big EU countries. The ruling party backs Germany, France and the UK's proposal for joint EU refugee centres. DF wants to turn away all migrants and refugees. We should definitely support schemes where you go in together and run some camps."
"How do the other parties think about the euro? Dutch politics is so divided on few issues as the future of Europe and the euro. . The PVV does not mince its words in its election programme: 'The Netherlands will leave the European Union'. The FvD also wants to leave the Union, but is in even more of a hurry to leave the euro: 'As an interim phase towards the inevitable nexit, the Netherlands can demand that membership of the EU is also possible without continuing to participate in the euro.

"However, the experience of governing in the current term of office has poured into the hearts of Law and Justice leaders the fear that EU membership is blocking the party's key political intentions - with the plan to gradually take over all the sensitive institutional centers and gain full power over the state and control over the life of society (or at least gain the potential opportunity to reach for it) at the forefront. The disadvantages of the EU, completely irrelevant to PiS's strategy during its 8 years in opposition, have, from its point of view, been outweighed by the advantages associated with financial injections preventing the build-up of frustrations in its own electoral base, dangerous for any government.Union has proved in many ways an effective counterweight to PiS's strategy of taking over the state."
"However, the view of the politically undecided is quite different: Only 30 per cent of them believe that the election will enable them to have a say in Europe's future, 27 per cent explicitly do not believe that, and 43 per cent refrain from stating anything. Similarly below average, although not quite as pronounced, is the confidence of FPÖ voters in the opportunities to participate in the EU election. The ÖVP voters are positioned roughly similarly to the average of the population."
"However, these arguments already appeal only to the toughest electorate. Polls show that the vast majority of respondents, including Law and Justice supporters, are against escalating relations with the EU. The European Union counter should cause further concern."
"I assume that on certain subjects, I am not yet in the majority of opinion,"" acknowledges Florian Philippot, who is there to convince people of the Frexit. The exit from the euro is no longer the priority of the FN, the party he advised until last summer.Fervent defender of the Brexit, the British MEP Nigel Farage wished in a video message good luck to the new party. Never doubt, even if you have to be patient because people will tell you it is impossible,"" the Briton warned."
"I fear that this political fiction novel is pretty close to the truth. PiS and its supporters watch with a smirk of satisfaction as the European Union and the world around us become increasingly unstable, seeing this as confirmation of their anti-liberal ideology.. In this growing chaos, the government, instead of looking for allies and islands of stability to which to moor our country, is pushing Poland into a gray zone where Russia - ideologically closer to many PiS politicians than liberal and secular Europe - is already waiting for us."
"I made the case for designated special status within the EU, in the customs union and the single market. That is the only guarantee of stability and certainty that will deliver the full protection of the Good Friday agreement in all its parts, including Irish citizenship, and therefore the benefits of EU citizenship. This evening the Sinn Féin politician John Finucane will address the first in a series of planned protests and demonstrations across Northern Ireland in support of designated special status for the North within the EU.. Mr Finucane said special status was a commonsense, practical and achievable approach that we will continue to work to achieve in Belfast, in Dublin, in London and in Europe."
I read about audios of Russian oil money Every time I hear this stuff I'm more proud of how M5S is funded I don't know if there are black funds from Russia for the League. But in the audio there is something very serious: the betrayal of the alliance with the EU and the United States.I am sure they will be able to explain all
"I think it is ridiculous to suggest that this model can be used between Denmark and Germany, says Frank McNamara. The Danish People's Party is well aware that the proposal would violate EU rules, but Anders Vistisen believes that Denmark should be willing to risk a court case. Right now, the Schengen rules are not being followed."
"I think you can distinguish, he says. DF rejects that the EU should interfere in how the Danish labour market is organised. It shows how rotten the EU system is."
"INTEGRATION LEADER for DF, Martin Henriksen, also feels much more at home in Flensburg, which is in Germany, than in Nørrebro and Nordvest, where I happen to live. DF have always been anti-EU. The EU is certainly endlessly problematic, unsatisfactory and fraught with internal divisions, yet the EU, as I see it, is necessary for individual countries and for the world.On the other end there is the Enhedslisten, I like Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, but the anachronistic ideological foundation of the Enhedslisten I can't move into."
"If he is to negotiate the basis of government with Kristian Thulesen Dahl after an election, the referendum will be fixed. The Left and the Danish Liberal Democrats may agree in principle that in government they could each recommend their own result, but Tuesday's false start to the EU election campaign strengthens the argument that Kristian Thulesen Dahl will remain outside any bourgeois government until the EU referendum is over. If the DF then discreetly triggers a government crisis midway through the next term and enters the government, he will also address another DF concern: namely that voters should see them as power-hungry, after years of mocking the SF for sacrificing its causes for the sake of power dreams. Instead, Thulesen Dahl can appear as someone who has to save a bourgeois government."
"If he wanted to win the support of the PP, he made it very difficult for himself by showing his most anti-European face. The Vox leader went so far as to describe the EU as a moderate replica of the People's Republic of China and to compare it to the Europe dreamed of by Hitler, while he celebrated the emergence of patriotic movements in the face of the despotic machinery of Brussels.He added to Trump's denialism by questioning whether climate change is the result of human action."

"If that position remains, I don't believe there will be any basis for a deal that is acceptable, Mr Murphy told the Irish Independent. Sinn Féin MEP for Midlands North West, Matt Carthy, said the approach taken by EU leaders will be viewed as a clear indication of the directions and values of the EU.Now is the time to reaffirm the founding principles of the European Union - solidarity, democracy and equality."
"If the DF is again to be a faithful support party like during the VKO cooperation in the 00's, there are two areas, it is crucial that the Left gets moved on. One is EU policy. For example, the Danish People's Party wants a blue government to work for Britain to negotiate a new deal on the EU membership that the British will later vote on.Denmark must be a player in the UK's renegotiation - not a player against, as we are right now, says Thulesen Dahl."
"If this characterization of the situation is correct, then Wilders's PVV has only to lose by cuts and reforms, which include more than a reduction in the development budget. This is all the more true when that policy is enforced by a European Union that is finally taking the demands on budget policy seriously.The choice facing the PVV is simply this: either it chooses relative power and responsibility, thus losing its character as a party of discontent and a rebellious counter-power to the establishment; or it chooses to perpetuate its role as an outsider and self-appointed voice of the people against the established Hague powers, thus losing its direct influence on government policy.A combination of those roles, which made the tolerance construction possible, will soon, after seven weeks or even longer of negotiations in the back rooms of the governmental power, no longer be credible."
"If you take the opposition, the camp of the EU-friendly (Greens, Neos) and the opponents of the Union (FPÖ) is about the same size. The fact that the EU-Stop party was able to register so many votes is one of the surprises of election day. This will give pause for thought to the FPÖ, which only came third by a clear margin after a frothy election campaign. The voters did not really comply with their wish for a lesson for the government: The result is a lesson that gives the government a grace period."
"Imposing sanctions on Poland and depriving it of its voting rights - the nuclear option - is not an option, however. Brussels fears that even if there were unanimity on this issue in the RE (and Hungarian Prime Minister Orban has announced his opposition), the effects could turn against the EU. The PiS government would throw all its forces into the fight against the EU, and after prolonged propaganda treatment, Polish society could turn away from the EU, just as the British did after a years-long anti-EU campaign.That's why the EU will cut our money and make it conditional on respect for the rule of law."
"In Christiansborg, the result has set off an internal political palaver about Denmark's EU policy, which the Danish People's Party and the Greens believe should be changed in a much more sceptical direction in respect of the election result. POLITICS The government is behaving arrogantly when it refuses to make a joint EU agreement with the no parties in Parliament, says the Danish Liberal Democrats, who on the other hand praise the Social Democrats for a change of course on EU policy.-- But Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen sweeps that wish off the table in Saturday's Politiken, because there is already a binding European policy agreement from 2008. The government's support party must understand that the Left will abide by the agreements it has made, says Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen."
"In Geert Wilders' eyes, the FN has become acceptable because Following the same anti-European battle horse, the PVV and the FN will make common cause against the euro, against Brussels and against mass immigration into the EU. Yet, even if the same political movement brings them together, several tectonic plates underlie the relationship between these two parties."
"In Germany, the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) was particularly active in praising and congratulating the FPÖ, as were the Lega Nord in Italy and the Front National in France. A statement by Marine Le Pen's party said that the FPÖ's election result was a welcome defeat for the EU and a slap in the face for the EU Commission, which ignored the European peoples' right to self-determination by trying to impose a supranational view on them. The leader of the Front National may no longer be a Member of the European Parliament, but she still represents the extreme right group (ENF), which is dominated by the Front with 20 out of 37 MEPs and which is fiercely opposed by the other groups, including the European People's Party."
"In Limburg, the PVV is the second largest party after the CDA and you might think: if the PVV leader is welcome anywhere, then here. But PVV fans are almost non-existent when Geert Wilders arrives at the Market Square at eleven o'clock, with flyers against the EU-Ukraine treaty - the referendum is in a few days. There are also few cameras."
"In Strasbourg the MEPs of the Democratic Party supported Juncker for having relaunched the Italian proposal on flexibility. MEP and League leader Matteo Salvini called the EU willingness in relation to refugee spending a disgrace and accused Renzi of being complicit with Brussels. He added that the League for years has been asking for flexibility to support work and pensions and to address the climate disasters in Italy, to no avail."

He added that the League for years has been asking for flexibility to support work and pensions and to deal with the climate disasters in Italy, to no avail. Now they are inventing flexibility just to keep spending on immigrants - protested Salvini -."
"In Thulesen Dahl's view, it is a poor excuse when the Left uses the Danish People's Party's EU-sceptic line as a reason why the party cannot form part of a bourgeois government. And he sees a clear opening when, after Cameron's speech, the pro-EU parties in Parliament have to acknowledge that flexible EU cooperation is a reality. EU Left rules out Danish People's Party in bourgeois government, but DF believes disagreement on EU policy is manageable. The British can handle having a government with a Eurosceptic party that has views similar to those of the Danish People's Party and a liberal party that is pro-EU."
"In a letter to the President of the Republic, she said: ""I don't see how the President of the Republic can fail to take the necessary decisions to make the National Assembly national and representative again. And that obviously requires a change in the voting system. The MEP, herself well ahead in the North-West (32.6% according to first estimates), also calls for a reconsideration of a ""series of submissions to the European Union"".If the National Front considers itself today as ""the only political movement capable of bringing voters back to the polls"",Visibly pumped up by this success,"
"In a reference to Midland North West MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, Mr Martin said one of our MEPs has been almost unchallenged with his calls for Ireland to follow Britain with Brexit and go out of the EU. On Sinn Féin, he said this party had consistently been fomenting an anti-EU approach and they take stances within EU parliament which is concerning in my view. He said Sinn Féin had been soft on Russia in the way that Russia seeks to undermine the European Union. He said its silence had been striking in relation to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine."
"In a time of growing unemployment, it should be an argument that makes an impression. In general, the Danish People's Party has a really bad case when it comes to substance.DF refers to the fact that the EU patent proposal interferes with national sovereignty.With that logic we should also say no to the internal market, environmental cooperation and the fight against international crime."
"In addition, the opening of the labor market for Poles must be reversed and for Bulgarians and Romanians must be stopped, Wilders' party believes. ,,The best thing, of course, is if we leave the EU. The PVV is politically alone with that last wish. Partly due to the advent of the Central and Eastern Europe hotline, support from other parties for PVV plans seems further away than ever anyway."
"In an agreement reached during the election campaign, the four blue parties stated that although they are far from agreeing on everything, together they will fight to put limits on the extension of welfare benefits to citizens from other EU countries, so that the EU does not become a social union. The four parties have also agreed to support Britain's controversial demand for a new deal with the EU.After the general election, the Danish People's Party ended up outside a government, even though it became the largest party in the blue bloc, and so far Kristian Thulesen Dahl has seen no indication that Lars Løkke Rasmussen will seriously live up to the agreement. In his own words, the DF chairman has both a negative and a positive interpretation of the situation."
"In his profession of faith for the second round, published last Friday, there is no longer any question of re-establishing monetary sovereignty, a term that appeared in the first round. The document just refers to a renegotiation of the European treaties-the next day, Saturday, the FN president on leave and her new ally, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, present their government agreement. Surprise: leaving the euro is no longer a prerequisite for any economic policy."
"In his view, the post-Brexit Union will not be able to cope with the departure of a second major country. But the Polish government is wrong to think that it can be a member of the EU for free, reads the Tagesspiegel. Meier points out that PiS wants to stylize the legal conflict with Brussels and Luxembourg as a fight for national sovereignty. The commentator warns not to be fooled by this, as the EU looks closely at whether or not a country's legal system is in line with EU standards."
"In order to broaden his electoral base to the right and win votes from the PP, Abascal is aware that he must iron out some of the edges of his discourse. Yesterday he acknowledged that he had committed some verbal excess in the debate in Congress; in it he compared the EU with the People's Republic of China or with the Europe dreamed by Hitler The reflection announced by Vox will be aimed at getting rid of its more eccentric profiles to stay with the essential, in Abascal's words: the visceral confrontation with the left and the pro-independence supporters. A strategy that they want to test already in the Catalan elections, on February 14, to which they give maximum relevance and in which they will present, for the first time, a candidate, Ignacio Garriga, who acted as spokesman in the motion."
"In order to prevent his own - equally divided - cabinet from tearing apart while bickering during the upcoming campaign, British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday gave his ministers the freedom to decide for themselves how they will vote in the referendum. A smart move, because the word 'Brussels' alone has a red rag effect on the eurosceptics. PVV Not only the PVV, but also other parties are going to work against Brussels, delay it and become less and less enthusiastic, notes the professor. ,,At least, that is the sound that administrators are now making in the Netherlands."
"In parallel, Bødskov stressed to Parliament and the Danish media that the change was merely symbolic and without real significance for who can be deported. The proposal from the Danish Parliament that Parliament should be able to look at letters to and from EU Commissioners is therefore supported by both sides in Parliament. I think it would be reasonable that rapporteurs are informed before a minister promises to change Danish legislation."
"In the '00s, rarely a summer went by when Pia Kjærsgaard or Kristian Thulesen Dahl did not stand up and use the summer cucumber season to show that the party was now definitely ripe for government cooperation. The Left and especially the Conservatives turned a blind eye, while highlighting the Danish People's Party's EU scepticism as the crucial obstacle.That is no longer the case."
"In the EU, the aim is to work as soon as possible for a revision of the rules on welfare benefits for migrant workers, so that member states have better possibilities to establish vesting principles, limit the possibilities for 'export' of welfare benefits and index benefits to the cost of living in the country where the benefit is received. The Danish People's Party believes that the Left has not delivered on any of these points. But this criticism is misguided, replies Jakob Ellemann-Jensen: The Left has not been Eurosceptic, and we still are not. We stand by the deal we made in the election campaign and we have defended it."
"In the ORF interview at the Opera Ball, Conchita called for as many people as possible to go to the EU elections and not just a certain part of our population in light of the Brexit. Because if few people go to the polls, the result will probably be what few people want. A statement by Moser's guest, which some interpreted as a dig at the EU-critical FPÖ.In Moser's ministry, they don't understand the excitement."
"In the SPÖ criteria catalogue, seven points are laid down as hurdles for entering into a coalition. The issue of Europe is a sensitive one with regard to the FPÖ. The reason is the Freedom Party's EU-critical stance, even though the Blue Party no longer wants to know about any flirtation with Austria leaving the EU after the Brexit decision in June 2016. Nevertheless, it will be difficult in matters of Europe if the SPÖ and the FPÖ take their positions seriously after the election."
"In the Ukraine crisis, there was a formulaic reference to the need for dialogue with Russia. Vienna is known within the EU as a sceptic on the sanctions issue. If it were up to Sebastian Kurz's coalition partner, the FPÖ, the punitive measures would have been history long ago. Austria did not participate in the expulsion of Russian diplomats by Western states in response to the poisoning of ex-GRU agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter."
"In the case of the RN, Jordan Bardella, an early activist who became one of the spokespersons after the presidential election, quickly climbed the steps of the RN: he joined the national bureau at the congress in March, before being appointed director of Generation Nation, the party's youth structure, with which he has developed links with the Italian League. The mayor of Fréjus David Rachline, elected in 2014 as the youngest senator at 26, hailed a perfect example of (...) meritocracy in the RN, representing a generation (...) that can no longer believe the lies of the European Union.However, he will not overshadow Marine Le Pen, who repeatedly says that she will lead the campaign."
"In the course of the afternoon, PVV leader Geert Wilders also reported in the virtual list leader debate that was conducted in full fervor through the media and on Twitter. According to Wilders, Roemer speaks with a double tongue because he is not nearly as euro-critical as the PVV. The SP, for example, just wants to remain a member of the European Union.Roemer doesn't make things any better at the end of the afternoon by nuancing his words bit by bit."
"In the meantime, you must choose a seat in the Europarliament. In the Euro-skeptic group in the making would be you, Marine Le Pen's National Front, the Northern League, Haider's Austrian heir Fpö, and perhaps Geert Wilders' Freedom Party, or the Slovak nationalists. We already have 5 parties of the 7 needed."
"In the press on Saturday, Norbert Hofer cancelled the Öxit. The FPÖ has been flirting for years with leaving the EU and the euro and re-establishing the old borders. Hofer even added fuel to the fire after the British Brexit decision."
"In the run-up to the referendum, the Danish People's Party in particular guaranteed that we could get as good a parallel agreement on Europol as by opting for the whole package. --Together with the other no parties - Liberal Alliance, Enhedslisten and Folkebevægelsen gegen EU - DF formulated a joint statement on why voters could safely vote no instead of handing over Danish sovereignty.If everything went wrong, you could always have a new referendum on police cooperation and the fight against terrorism, but keep the rest of the legal reservation."
"In the wake of the invasion of Crimea, the European Parliament voted in favour of a resolution condemning the invasion and the human rights abuses that followed. Sinn Féin, along with Nigel Farage's Ukip and Marine Le Pen's National Front, did not vote in favour of the motion.Sinn Féin deflected from Russia's invasion, stating that the motion completely ignores any responsibility of the EU for its role in the development of this conflict."
"In this context, it is worth noting that the French government has made the exit from the euro one of the key points of its campaign. The ""re-establishment"" of a national currency as well as the ""prerogatives of the Bank of France in consultation"" with the European partners should, according to the FN, ""boost"" exports, industry and employment. The official programme of the Front de gauche considers that a return to the franc is ""economically risky"" and ""politically harmful""."
"In this context, the far-right party, which last year appeared with several representatives of the far right in Europe, still explains that if it is not (already) in power, ""its ideas are"" almost everywhere. The strategy is as follows: the Marinist formation wants to be part of the ""largest bloc to force the others to join"", explains an RN executive. Having the first group in the European Parliament is conceivable this time; it would upset the situation by offering us a blocking majority"", says another a little quickly. According to him, Le Pen's party and Salvini's League could succeed in bringing in the German AfD, ""not yet an official ally but it's happening"", which would then push the Polish Eurosceptic conservatives of the PiS, the Czech xenophobes of the SPD, or the Bulgarian far right (Volya) to join."
"In this light, it is surprising that the Norwegian Nobel Committee honours the EU for its contribution to peace and reconciliation by awarding it this year's Peace Prize. EU parliamentarian Morten Messerschmidt ( DF) calls it completely acidic: The euro has created deeply chaotic conditions in southern Europe, violent demonstrations that have probably been the most aggressive since the Second World War, says the DF member.The sceptical tone of Morten Messerschmidt is likely to be echoed by a large number of Greeks, according to Ioannis Konstantinidis, a lecturer in political science at the University of Thessaloniki in Greece."
"In this situation, PiS is quietly hoping for early elections in Italy and the return of the League to power, probably in alliance with the Brothers of Italy from ECR. In this way, Poland would gain an important ally in the EU Council sharing the vision of PiS, which wants to build a national majority democracy based on the dismantling of the rule of law and the domination of the ruling party. However, a League takeover and its initiation of Polish-style reforms would mean a major challenge to the survival of the EU as a single legal space (after Brexit, Italy is the third largest member state) and could cause major upheavals in the Italian economy, which is already in crisis."
"In this uneasy muddle, Britain is becoming a political laboratory for the whole of Europe. The expertise of two of the most respected British political scientists - Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin - who, in view of the successes of Trump and Brexit, Salvini and AfD, are presenting a fundamental work on the new political confrontation in Europe: National Populism - The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy. If one follows their theses, then Brexit is not the big bang, but rather the consequence of a deep social crisis that has been going on for some time."
"In view of last Sunday's clear vote, there is also no reason for well-meaning European partners to complain and warn. Despite some cross shots, the ÖVP remains in the mainstream of EU policy, and the FPÖ leadership seems determined not to deviate from this course. By so vehemently claiming the Ministry of the Interior for himself, Heinz-Christian Strache also makes it clear that he is not demanding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
"Ingolf Gabold was for more than 12 years drama director at DR. In '1864' he would discuss what he calls the whole isolation that lies in the Danish People's Party's very nationalistic belief in Denmark and the Danish, which according to Ingolf Gabold means that the Danish People's Party is very xenophobic and very afraid of the EU. As a former drama director, I am allowed to say: I am political."
"Instead, Geert Wilders' euro-critical PVV appears to have lost elections yesterday for the third time in a row - after previously losing in the 2012 Lower House elections and last March in the municipal elections. Internationally, most of the attention was focused on Wilders: the PVV's preliminary result would possibly show how big the victory of the Eurosceptic bloc will be across the European Union this weekend. Wilders himself had therefore loudly predicted gains for his party in recent weeks."
"Instead, Weidel calls for a return to the fundamental freedoms in a democratic Europe of subsidiarity and the democratic rights of national parliaments. This is the basis of the AfD's concept for EU reform. As a first step, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on the procedure for withdrawals would have to be worded differently."
"Interesting is the attitude of the Russian lobby in Germany. For example, Leif-Erik Holm, deputy leader of the AfD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, is raging against expensive North American liquefied natural gas and is demanding a government commitment to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to bring even more Russian gas to Germany, bypassing our EU and Nato partners Poland and the Baltic states. The AfD man suspects: the chancellor is an insecure wobbler on this issue. Language criticism aside: Merkel's strategic turnaround is indeed not good news for Putin.. For the West it is."
International Economics page 8. The Danish People's Party's popular MEP may struggle to find his place in a fight between sceptical EP groups after the 25 May elections. If Morten Messerschmidt and possibly.
"It is against this backdrop that the European Commission is preparing to put Rome under pressure, not least because it itself is under pressure. As soon as the refusal of the M5S-Lega government to change a budget in violation of every rule was received in Brussels, yesterday the protest from other capitals started within hours. The finance ministers of The Hague and Vienna, Wopke Hoekstra and Hartwig Löger, have made it clear that their countries are the most irritated in the compact group of the other 18 eurozone countries."
"It is obvious that world views will clash in the European elections. The AfD will brand the EU and the euro as European schismatics, their opponents will castigate the AfD as German schismatics.The political competitors would be well advised to show, in a similarly down-to-earth manner as the AfD, with a forward-looking Alternative for Europe, what advantages a common European approach will bring in many fields, without concealing the costs and disadvantages associated with the EU and the euro for Germany."
"It seems to me that more and more forces are pushing into the AfD that do not make proposals on how to further develop our society, but rather question our free democratic basic order in principle. . At the AfD national party conference it became apparent that at least part of the party wants to abolish the Western connection, Nato, the EU and the European peace order - democrats cannot allow that."
"It therefore falls to Ole Sohn on behalf of the Danish presidency to land the compromise in the EU circle, which subsequently promises to be a regular drama in Parliament. The EU patent court will be a double headache for Minister of Economic Affairs Ole Sohn, who has been given the extra task of securing an EU compromise.EU Presidency--The Danish People's Party has definitively announced that it will demand a referendum on the patent court, which implies a surrender of Danish sovereignty and therefore requires the agreement of at least five-sixths of the Danish Parliament if it is to be approved without a referendum. This means that the government must have the backing of the Greens, who have so far been vehemently opposed to the patent court."
"It was essentially the Europhobic wave that sent these unidentified political objects to Strasbourg. The French FN, with its 24 winners, is the sensation of the day. But Nigel Farage's Ukip in the UK is performing similarly. And in Poland, Denmark and Greece with the neo-Nazis of Golden Dawn, the voters have also given European representation to the extremes."
"It was not explained concretely - especially by this party - what it was all about. The party was against the EU, and therefore it used prejudice and scapegoat politics, he says of the Danish People's Party's promises in the run-up to the vote on 3 December 2015. At the time, the DF said that Denmark could have an equal parallel agreement on Europol after a no vote.In reality, it has proved extremely difficult for Denmark to get a special deal, says Martin Schulz."
"It was still the old AfD under the party leader of the time The AfD looks downright enviously to Italy, where Salvini's party is succeeding in what it itself is far from achieving: government participation and with it the prospect of real power. ""It is very gratifying that two anti-establishment parties have prevailed in Italy,"" says AfD leader Jörg Meuthen, who as an EU parliamentarian can see his role models every sitting day. Meuthen praises the Lega's negative stance on Russia sanctions and the future Italian government's promises of tax cuts."
"It won't be a surprise to anyone, the former doesn't get much press. Only half of French people would be attached to the European Union, an attachment that is widely shared by all parties except the Rassemblement National, Debout la France and very much shared by France Insoumise. But while a small majority want the EU to do a thorough review of its actions, only 14% advocate a Frexit."
"It won't be like that for Denmark, because we are outside the eurozone, he says. However, this explanation is not good enough for the EU-sceptic parties, the Danish People's Party and Enhedslisten, who consider it wrong not to ask the people as in Ireland. We are in complete agreement with the Irish."
"It's getting more expensive, and we can't keep financing it, he says. The Left therefore wants the government to present a proposal on how it will handle the judgment, while MEP Morten Messerschmidt of the Danish People's Party goes even further with demands that Denmark, in order to protect welfare, use its veto power to add another reservation to the assembly when negotiating a new EU treaty. This is the biggest threat to the welfare state of all, he says."
"It's impossible to know the scale of economic hardship EU withdrawal will cause in Northern Ireland, where the majority voted Remain. Northern Ireland's farming community seems set to be first in line to fall victim to changing trade agreements and tariffs, but if other pockets of economic activity implode, then support for a United Ireland in a border poll might grow significantly, propelled simply by the pragmatic desire to retain the benefits of EU membership.The rise of Sinn Féin in such a scenario, under the leadership of Michelle O'Neill in the North and Mary Lou McDonald in the south, neither of whom have bloodstained hands, prompted Micheál Martin to announce running Fianna Fáil candidates in Northern Ireland's 2019 council elections.Martin has also announced a White Paper on reunification, containing 12 concrete ideas about improving relations on the island."
"Its YouTube page features a montage including a variety of contributions made by Ms McDonald in 2008 when the Lisbon Treaty was being debated ahead of the first referendum, when it was rejected by Irish voters. Ms McDonald said the treaty gives powerful EU institutions a free hand to further militarise our union.Mr Durkan claimed Sinn Féin's message provided grist to Nigel Farage's mill.He added: Sinn Féin claim to have moved from being Eurosceptic to being Euro critical but it's clear that they essentially are backing vocalists for Euro disrupters. A Sinn Féin spokesperson responded, saying: This is a desperate attempt by Mark Durkan to make himself relevant."
"Ja parties will put massive pressure on the Danish People's Party to vote yes when the patent court is put to a vote in parliament - probably shortly after the opening of parliament next year. It seems very strange that the Danish People's Party chooses the course to say that even if they have said yes in the EU, they will say no in Denmark to force a referendum.We have other things to occupy our time than spending 80 to 100 million DKK on holding a referendum, says EU spokesperson Lene Espersen ( K)."
"Ja. However, in the future there could be a soft and a hard currency in the EU.The FPÖ has spoken out against aid to Greece in the form of loans and guarantees. Would you refuse such aid in future as Federal President, even if it risked a possible collapse of the common currency, the euro?"
"Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the Law and Justice party, has no doubt who is at fault and who should be held responsible for Brexit: - A particularly grim role was played by Donald Tusk, who led the negotiations with the British and basically led to the fact that they did not get anything, so he bears direct responsibility for Brexit and should disappear from European politics, but this applies to the entire European Commission in its current composition. Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera in an interview with Rzeczpospolita lamented: If Prime Minister Szydlo's voice had been listened to, Brexit would not have happened, but the EU elites are deaf and blind to these voices. PiS litters accusations, but remains silent about its political family in the European Parliament. PiS MEPs are the second largest national group in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) faction."
"Jaume Duch, the Parliament's spokesman, said in the late afternoon. The pro-European right-wing European People's Party (EPP) remains the largest group in the European Parliament with 178 seats (up from 216) out of 751, ahead of the Social Democrats (152 seats up from 185), according to European Parliament projections. Among the Eurosceptics, the ENL group, which brings together Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National and Matteo Salvini's League, has risen from 37 to 55 seats, while the populist EFDD group, which includes the Italian Five Star Movement and is expected to be joined by Nigel Farage's new Europhobic party, has increased from 42 to 53 seats.Populist Nigel Farage's Brexit Party leads the UK European elections with nearly 31.5% of the vote, according to the BBC."
"Jokisipilä says that this solution will calm the situation from the point of view of both the reform of the social and health care system and regional government and European policy. The fact that Jussi Halla-aho took the immigration and EU-critical wing of the True Finns with him into the opposition makes cooperation easier, he says. It will facilitate future negotiations on the European Union's common defence and asylum policy."
"Jolanda de Pee, Ridderkerk Flag On page 17 of the PVV election program it says: we request the EU to remove our star from its flag. However, the circle of golden stars represents solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe."

On the contrary! Today, the Rassemblement National is announcing ""we are coming"". But they are already there, in the European Parliament! And nobody notices."
"Juncker was challenged in the meeting of the leaders of the groups in the Europarliament. You are acting with the aim of bringing down the Tsipras government, accused Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right (and ally of the League), who blamed the blame for Greece's risk of bankruptcy on the creditors' troika austerity measures. You're ridiculous, Juncker allegedly replied."
"KOWAL For opponents and critics of the European Union, PiS is a wietn party . Like them, it has been scaring voters about the EU for several years, but now, like them, it wants to get its people into the EuroparliamentuDr Pawe Kowal, politician and political scientist, former MP"
"Kaczynski enumerates: EU institutions, its various officials, some politicians whom Poles have never elected anywhere, demand from us that we verify our entire culture, reject everything that is of great importance to us. He doesn't give details, but it's clear that he's referring to the EU's increasingly vocal opposition to PiS's violations of the rule of law and to the LGBT-bashing that the government has passionately pursued over the past few months, rather than diligently preparing for a second wave of the epidemic.Poland, by joining the Union, committed itself to a catalog of principles and values."
"Kristian Thulesen Dahl will not explain what the consequences will be if Løkke does not follow his call. Conservatives reject DF's demands The Conservatives' EU spokesman, Lars Barfoed, flatly denies that they will make the same demands of Lars Løkke if he becomes prime minister.Instead, Lars Barfoed calls for Denmark to use Britain's desire for less EU to roll some sovereignty back to Parliament."
Language is hugely important to Sinn F^8in. Take the party's line on the EU. The biggest criticism levelled against SF by its political opponents is that they oppose almost everything in Europe. And the unkindest cut of all are the comparisons with Britain's Ukip.
"Larger than looking back at his role as a tolerance partner, PVV leader Geert Wilders focused on Brussels, on a European Union that will ensure that the Netherlands will end up with an empty wallet. It is the PVV theme for the elections: The Netherlands should not only leave the euro, but even the European Union. Pechtold asked Wilders to have the effects of such an exit calculated, but Wilders ignored that."
"Lars Løkke certainly wants Britain to maintain close ties with the EU. But that message is accompanied by an important addition that rights and duties go hand in hand, echoing the concerns of heads of state and government in several other EU countries.--While the Eurosceptics in the Danish People's Party believe that Denmark should work for the best possible deal for Britain, the Left stresses that the two countries do not necessarily have the same interests when it comes to negotiating fisheries and much else.. The ruling party would therefore rather talk about an agreement for the benefit of Denmark."
"Last in the first round with 0.92%, the UPR states that no other party represents [its] ideas. All the other candidates are increasingly committed to the mortifying tutelage of the European Union--The far left calls for a barrage against the right and the FN--All the components of the Left Front, which did not pass the 5% mark to merge before the second round of the regional elections on Sunday in Aquitaine, Poitou-Charentes and Limousin, called yesterday on its voters to barrage the right and the far right."
"Latvian European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, who leads the center-right strict commissioners, urged a responsible fiscal policy, reinforcing earlier calls by his Finnish colleague Jyrki Katainen. Swedish EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström expressed concerns about M5S and Lega's stance on international trade. Pro-Berlin Eurobureaucrats have even circulated the risk of a downgrading of Italian debt to levels that would prevent aid from the ECB (as for Greece and Cyprus)."
"Le Pen, who could get up to 20 percent of the French vote in next year's local elections according to some polls, wants to form a single political group in the European Parliament after the June 2014 elections with like-minded Eurosceptic and anti-immigration parties. In addition to the Dutch PVV, she also talks to Vlaams Belang and the late Jörg Haider's Austrian FPÖ.Since Le Pen took over the leadership of the Front National from her father Jean-Marie in 2011, she has tried to professionalize the party, she says. With an agenda focused on economic protectionism, more and more voters see her as an alternative to the two major French power blocs, the socialist PS and the center-right UMP."
"Lega and FPÖ, whose parties sit together in a Eurosceptic EU parliamentary group, agree on the basic idea, Harald Vilimsky confirmed in advance to the press. The FPÖ secretary-general travelled with them to Rome.Both parties want strict protection of the EU's external borders, mass deportation, on-site reception camps, asylum applications outside the EU and cooperation with countries of origin as well as main transit countries of immigrants. Vilimsky reiterated that the Australian model could serve as a model: refugees are interned on islands off Australia and not allowed on the mainland in the first place."
"Leonoor Kuijk BrusselsA portion of the House of Representatives (PVV, CDA, Christian Union, SGP) yesterday raised critical questions about the support of about five billion euros promised to Egypt by the European Union. The SGP said it was stunned."
"Lerner invited two professors, Luciano Canfora and Marco Tarchi, to discuss high topics, such as the exploit of the League in the South, populism, communication, xenophobia, the polarization of hostility (the need to always create an enemy), the European extreme right, the aversion to multiculturalism. In short, a discussion for insiders with some interesting stimuli: Canfora quotes Aristophanes' The Knights where 400 years before the birth of Christ, a sausage maker, with speeches of low demagogy, manages to be the winner in a race for power; Tarchi explains how the League is not a true nationalist party: first it hated the Italian State, now the EU.The real problem with the talk, with a setting so retro it seems inviting, is that the host tends toward a journalistic view of the issues, while his guests start from a more theoretical field."
"Lowering the policy areas as EU tasks will certainly not make the EU more popular either in Denmark or in the rest of Europe. Even the Danish People's Party has sporadically supported the EU's environmental drive. But the DF's EU policy is otherwise indescribable, it resembles a chicken coop where the fox has entered: the statements about the EU flutter in many directions. Is it the revelation of their electoral deception from the referendum on reservations or the general fear of responsibility that is panicking them? ON MANY POINTS, however, the DF's policy resembles that of the Unity Party."
"Lucke: The FDP wants a federal state, the United States of Europe. The AfD wants the EU to remain a confederation of independent, sovereign states.Lindner: We are for more Europe where it makes sense."
"Luger: Much has changed within the FPÖ in the last two years. The FPÖ is now committed to the EU, which, as we know, was not always the case. And social democracy has demonstrably drawn consequences from the changes of recent years in questions of immigration and security policy."
"Luigi Di Maio, for his part, says that he has not spoken of the subject with Salvini, even if inside the Movement the rumors that see as replaceable at least a couple of ministers are getting stronger and stronger: at the top of the list of rumors are Giulia Grillo, Health, and Danilo Toninelli, Infrastructure (who says I'm going ahead to work with great peace of mind). Salvini, on the other hand, talks a lot about the subject, but he says that he does not claim anything and that he does not want seats for the League. Yesterday he pointed the finger at the absence of a minister for EU policies: It would be important. I don't care what color, but while the new Europe, the new Commission, the new Parliament and the new ECB are being born, having discovered the Minister of Community Policies, doesn't seem useful."
Lunacek: I would like the federal government to take the future of the EU as seriously as I and others do. But I fear that this will not be the case because of the FPÖ. Standard:
"Magdeburg - AfD candidate team The AfD has nominated euro-critical candidates for the 2019 European elections at the party congress in Magdeburg, who will criticise the EU in their speeches u. a."
"Mahrer: I like the department very much. When the FPÖ came into government in 2000, the EU criticised it harshly and even imposed sanctions against Austria. Would that be the case again today?"
"Man apparently takes it for granted. But we have it like DF. There is nothing agreed in advance, she says.In total, 19 EU countries have offered to provide land and buildings for the EMA, which is headquartered in London until April 2019, but will then have to move as a result of Brexit.The 19 bids have been vetted by the European Commission in August and September - and are now competing to take over the EMA."
"Man is hardly bothering anyone by claiming that it is currently an open question what the British will negotiate home. At the same time, it is an equally open question how the Danish People's Party in government will seek to combine its EU scepticism with possible government responsibility.When Politiken asked Thulesen on Friday whether the Danish People's Party plans to stand firm on a demand for a referendum to be written into the government's basis, the party is seeking to get equal in-flux, the answer was so woolly that you would think he had already become a minister: We have not dealt with that yet, he said."
"Many of the formations that the RN would need for the coalition come from a right-wing that is not related to the extreme right, although they are anti-immigration, anti-Islam, and opposed to multiculturalism, but they do not have the same matrix, the political scientist adds. Parties that are more compatible with Nicolas Dupont-Aignan's sovereignty. While the head of Debout la France (DLF) was a supporter of Marine Le Pen in the last presidential election, he is now the head of his own party's list for the European elections and does not believe that the RN can organise the meeting of the extreme right in Europe. ""It's all a bluff."
"Marine Le Pen does not go to the end of what she calls the other or the real Europe either. Long live Europe, the real Europe, she concluded, without saying whether she was referring to a Christian Europe or to the multi-millennial Europe anchored in Indo-European civilisation, he notes.But when the leader of the RN evokes a people that voluntarily organises the irreversible submergence of its territory, that plans the questioning of its culture and the disappearance of its identity, Valérie Igounet sees in it an echo of the controversial thesis of the great replacement.On her Twitter account, Ms Le Pen spoke of immigration that will make culture and way of life disappear through dilution or substitution, words that the RN leader did not use on stage."
"Mark Rutte Demissary Prime Minister: 'A wonderful recognition of the great historical role of the European Union for peace, security and democracy.'Geert WildersPVV leader and fierce EU critic on twitter:'Nobel Prize for the EU."
"Meanwhile, there is more trouble brewing over the EU-Canada deal, which was signed at a summit last month. The European Parliament is due to vote in December on whether the EU can apply the deal provisionally pending votes in national parliaments.But Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy (pictured above) has said the Parliament should reject the deal unless there is more clarity about which sections will apply, and what effects the deal will have on the EU's farmers..The EU is due to publish a key report on the cumulative effects of trade agreements on Europe's agricultural sector on Tuesday."
"Mikkel Dencker joined the Danish Democratic Party 20 years ago to the day. The party was only a few months old, and in the DF he found the combination of EU scepticism and a tough immigration policy that awakened the political germ in him. Until then, no party had really captured the young Dencker, who had not grown up in a political home."
"Minister De Jager and Olli Rehn were in Washington last weekend at the IMF, but did not discuss the Dutch problems. However, The Hague did inform the Commission that VVD and CDA are doing their best to get a parliamentary majority for the austerity plans that the PVV rejected. That is the compass on which Brussels is now sailing. Elections, one realizes, can change everything again."
"Monika Düker, head of the Green Party in NRW, has accused the Alternative for Germany (AfD) of ""using racist positions to serve prejudices and fears against immigration and Islam. The AfD's ""election campaign is based on the pattern of right-wing populist parties and fronts the EU with nationalist tones,"" Düker told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. The AfD focuses on Islam as the enemy, opposes immigration and rails against gays and lesbians. With slogans such as ""The euro is ruining Europe"", Düker believes the AfD is fuelling fears of threats and setting European unification back years."
"More concretely, Kristian Thulesen Dahl imagines that area by area, what is in Denmark's interest to be part of, will be discussed, so that in the end you have an overall package, which you negotiate, and which can then be sent to a referendum. DF stresses that he does not want Denmark out of the EU.He sees a Danish interest in cooperation on the internal market and cross-border issues such as the environment and consumer protection."
"Morten Messerschmidt also calls for plans to combat the payment of SU to foreigners, just as he finds it foolish that the government does not support Britain's desire for treaty changes. During the election campaign, V, DF, LA and K presented the joint EU proposal 'Danish welfare in Europe'.The goal is that welfare benefits stay in Denmark and go to those who live in Denmark for a longer period."
"Morten Messerschmidt assures that the event complies with the rules for the use of EU funds: We were around and talk EU. All our local associations were handing out EU materials - it couldn't get more EU - albeit maritime, says the DF politician.His colleague in the European Parliament, Social Democrat Jeppe Kofod, is not so sure that the boat trip should have been financed with EU funds."
"Morten Messerschmidt declares himself very open to joining the Conservatives in the ECR, because he wants to have as much influence as possible. The goal is operational EU scepticism, as the Danish People's Party's lead candidate in the EP elections says. It's about getting influence, so that you can actually withdraw powers to the member states."
"Ms Fitzgerald's comments came as agreement was reached in Strasbourg yesterday on the sharing of passenger records by 461 to 179 votes, after five years of debate on the issue. Sinn Féin has adamantly opposed the sharing of name records and voted against the introduction of the EU directive on several occasions.Every state has the right and the duty to protect their citizens."
"Ms McDonald said the treaty gives powerful EU institutions a free hand to further militarise our union. Mr Durkan claimed Sinn Féin's message provided grist to Nigel Farage's mill.He added: Sinn Féin claim to have moved from being Eurosceptic to being Euro critical but it's clear that they essentially are backing vocalists for Euro disrupters. A Sinn Féin spokesperson responded, saying: This is a desperate attempt by Mark Durkan to make himself relevant.The spokesperson claimed: His ignorance to the militarisation of the EU is astonishing, especially when senior European figures have been so open about their support for the establishment of an EU army."
"Much ado about nothing? After the electoral shock of 25 May, the political dust has not yet settled in the Strasbourg assembly, and this constituent session was hardly the scene of a shouting match. So it was backstage, and with her twenty new MEPs all smiles, that the FN president said all the bad things she thought of the EU - ""this prison of the people"" - with a dig at the former president On the anti-EU front,But she is not disarmed: ""Forming a group? I can do it by the end of the legislature and I even hope to achieve it before the end of the year,"" she told Le Figaro."
"My friend Sir Roger Scruton supported Brexit, and yet he is a quintessential renaissance man who shares none of Ukip's sinister parochialism. Furthermore, isn't there just a hint of moral hypocrisy in the response of those, such as Sinn Féin, who decry Britain's right to self-determination and independence? After all, if Sinn Féin had its way, Ireland would not be a member of the EU.FOR most ordinary British people, the decision to leave the EU was a patriotic one."
"My question is: Do you still want to? We will deal with the situation if a parallel agreement is not reached, when it has not been reached, says Thulesen Dahl, who speaks of a political game in which the Danish and the EU system are in a very good position if it ends with another vote. Other 'no' parties shun DF During the election campaign, the Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance, Enhedslisten and the People's Movement against the EU joined forces in a declaration in which, in addition to the desire for a parallel agreement, they also mention the alternative of a limited opt-in system as an emergency solution.Now, however, the message from the DF creates division on the no team."
"Nationalists and exporters tend to rally around the duel line. Parties such as the Danish People's Party see in Russia an ally in the fight against a strong EU, a united struggle against radical Islam and the belief in a strong nation state, while Italian and German business interests in particular argue for lowering the level of conflict through an expansion of economic interaction. German business - despite the EU sanction - has already invested as much in Russia in the first half of this year as in the whole of 2015, a recent survey in Germany's Der Spiegel showed."
"Naturally, electoral considerations currently play a role in this. In the run-up to September 12, the VVD fears being sucked into a further European deepening with the accompanying transfer of power to Brussels. That would be grist to the mill of the PVV, which wants to turn the election campaign into a referendum on Europe. Rutte is trying to make himself as small as possible on this issue."
"Neither Rajoy's fear nor Iglesias' rancor! Today is a difficult day for all of Europe, some have thrown a lot of wood on the fire and we have all been burned, said Diaz. The Andalusian president emphasized the defense that the PCE, encompassed within IU and its recent alliance with Podemos, makes of leaving the euro and the communitarian Europe. Who will be happy about the Brexit? Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump, but also Diego Cañamero, Julio Anguita, Teresa Rodríguez and Iglesias, because they did not want Spain in Europe. And if Iglesias does not say so, it is because he thinks it could be bad for him on Sunday."
"Neither the Left nor the Radical Left, however, plan to drop the principled ambition to abolish the reservations, even though the Danes clearly protected the legal reservation. And although Lars Løkke Rasmussen has blamed general EU scepticism for part of the rejection, the question is also how interested the Danish People's Party would really be in packing away their criticism of EU policy with a compromise. The party previously wanted a withdrawal from the EU."
Netherlands will have fewer notes on its singing anyway. The cabinet's PVV-enforced attempt to tighten EU rules on family reunification is likely to die a quiet death before the summer. The Netherlands had hardly any supporters in Europe anyway.
"Next example: Finance Minister Gernot Blümel (ÖVP), who is also the top candidate of the Turks in Vienna, came under criticism for his anti-European rhetoric regarding the fixed cost subsidy to overcome the Corona crisis. Here, too, the suspicion is obvious: Is he criticising the Union because he is haggling for votes from former FPÖ voters who tend to be hostile to the EU?And then there is the discussion about taking in refugees: SPÖ, Greens and Neos in Vienna agreed to take in 100 children from Moria."
"Next example: Finance Minister Gernot Blümel (ÖVP), who is at the same time the top candidate of the Turks in Vienna, came under criticism for his anti-European rhetoric regarding the fixed cost subsidy to cope with the Corona crisis.

"Next question. How will she deal with the FPÖ, which will pursue an EU-sceptical course?She distinguishes between a domestic government coalition and an election campaign. The coalition is working well, but: Of course, there are parties at the European level that I can only warn against."
"Nicola Campoli, Naples Curiosity / 1League and M5SLeague of Salvini and cricketers make common front to leave the European Union and the euro. It is curious to observe that the enemies of the out-of-towners will campaign aimed at becoming one...."
"No more talk of the Öxit. Vilimsky today even denies that the FPÖ called for EU withdrawal during the election campaign of presidential candidate Norbert Hofer in 2016, although press releases via APA clearly prove this. They only wanted to ask the people about it, they say today."
"Not as a mechanism to get one over unionism or as a means to something else, but as a community of human rights, prosperity, security, and common interest that Northern Ireland is better being part of, he said. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said his party had campaigned for 'Remain' despite their own critical view of EU policy.We did so because it would be simply incomprehensible to have one part of this small island operating within the EU and another part outside it, he said."
"Not even in the European variant. The EU issues were apparently used up for the EU elections in May and then largely disposed of. If, however, the visit of FPÖ top candidate Norbert Hofer to his friend Viktor Orbán in Hungary is enough of a foreign policy accent, then they were well catered for. Was Austria's position in the world an issue? No."
"Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the idea of paid interrail. British Conservatives have called the project a diversion to cover up the failure of EU politicians to deliver on their promises to create more jobs for Europe's young people.The Danish People's Party in the European Parliament is highly critical of the move. It's safe to say that I'm not jubilantly Europhile about it, says Morten Messerschmidt and continues, I see it more as a bribery project to make young people love the Union by allowing them to travel the continent."
"Not so more recently. Whether directed at Socialist Party or Sinn Féin activists or the broader EU-critical movement, such characterisations would have drawn righteous indignation: We are not anti-European, we are for an alternative Europe. In part at least, probably influenced by contact with other EU left/green parties, that is an acknowledgment , explicitly or not, that the union is seen less as simply a rich man's club and more as a vessel to be filled, fashioned and steered in a social direction by determined campaigners, whether MEPs or social movements on the streets. The arguments made by many on the pro-European left, particularly in Ireland, had found some echo - that the EC/EU had, after all, established important, progressive social standards, on hours, equal pay, part-time rights; and on issues such as the environment, consumer rights and food quality."
"Not surprisingly, the programme clearly rejects EU accession talks with Turkey, and Kurz and Strache will be looking for more allies to break off the negotiations. The Western Balkan countries should retain their EU perspective as before. Austria should actively assume the protective function for South Tyrol, an FPÖ demand.Interesting: The government programme explicitly states that Austria under its new government wants to actively promote the policy of détente between the West and Russia and advocate the dismantling of sanctions against Russia."
"Nothing is too crazy for FvD, it seems 'EU Parliament turns heel' (AD 24-7). If it were up to Forum voor Democratie, there would be a referendum in the Netherlands on the EU budget. Let people decide for themselves about their money, says Forum parliamentarian Gert-Jan Eppink."
"Now he crams everything into a thurmix that he postulates as post-nationalist (nobody enjoys praising nationalism anymore): the Valley of the Fallen, the Brussels bureaucracy, direct democracy, women's rights, self-determination even for a small municipality: everyone has the right if they organize themselves against sacred unions. The motley bag of heteroclite concepts overwhelms: At times I seemed to hear, in one voice, those of Podemos, the Grillini and the Brexit Conservatives, the European expert recalls.This new national populism with patina 2.0 does not require specific argumentative rigor: its narrative overrides key data, such as the parliamentary coup of September with its rupture laws that abrogated the Constitution and the Statute and gave birth to the subsequent disasters."
"Now it will be even more difficult, because the Danish prime minister, like the British, is closing off negotiations on the rebate in advance, he says. At Christiansborg, Helle Thorning's hard line is received with cheers by the EU sceptics in both Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti.It's absolutely fantastic if Thorning wants to guarantee that we get the perfectly reasonable EU rebate in this way. She must definitely go out on the line, we will hold her to that, says DF's chairman, Kristian Thulesen Dahl."
"Now that all has failed, Europe's problems come to the fore even more succinctly. The PVV could make noise along the sidelines on that point in the gedoogcoalitie, but Wilders had a hard time selling the fact that at the same time he was supporting a cabinet that, as the PVV claimed, was making knee-jerk reactions to the anonymous bureaucrats in Brussels.The PVV has had a lot of influence on Rutte's Europe policy in the past year anyway."
"Nowogrodzka's position on this issue has been known for a long time. The Law and Justice Party does not agree with the progressive integration of Europe. Since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, there has been a very strong current in the EU calling for deeper integration. On the other hand, we also have countries that strongly contest this course and would like the opposite."
"Officially, it is said that the formation of a government in Vienna is a purely domestic matter. According to the Standard, however, Kurz will be told in confidential talks that in Brussels, as in Berlin, a black-blue government is viewed with great scepticism because of Austria's upcoming EU presidency. At the European level, the FPÖ is assigned to the camp of the extreme right with the French Front National and its leader Marine Le Pen; it is part of the ENF group in the European Parliament.Juncker has already expressed in harsh words that he considers the FN plans to destroy the EU dangerous."
"Old Youghal Road, Cork. Sir, I find the Sinn Féin stance on the EU fiscal compact treaty rather confusing.In December 2010 the party voted in the Dáil against the bailout, with Mary Lou McDonald stating that the EU and IMF were behaving like loan sharks .The party is now arguing for a No vote in the referendum."
"On day one of the Brexit, the chief operators of the exit from the EU had to admit that they lied to the British people. This charlatanism is what the almost-federal president Norbert Hofer of the FPÖ now wants to do to Austria.The copycat Already on day 1 of Brexit, the chief operators of the exit from the EU had to admit that they lied to the British people."
"On the Nationalist side Sinn Féin have a ways to go to catch up with the SDLP, whose founder John Hume, borrowed heavily from Franco-German post-World War II reconciliation to imagine a Northern Ireland peace settlement. But like many other things, Sinn Féin has backed away from anti-EU policies which once matched Maggie Thatcher's Tories at their worst.The Taoiseach's slightly careless comment that British Prime Minister, Theresa May, may choose to trigger the Article 50 exit process ahead of the outer deadline of next March, caused some disturbance in London."
"On the contrary, she will paint the picture that the process after the conclusion of the agreement is open and real. It works best with the Eurosceptic Danes.These are also the Eurosceptic Danes that the Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance and Enhedslisten are talking to when they keep demanding a referendum, even though they know that it is politically unrealistic.These parties see an opportunity to profile themselves and attract some of the Eurosceptic voters found in most parties."
"On the menu of the left-wing lists too, new social taxes: universal tax for individuals for LFI, tax on financial transactions for the three other lists (whose programmes are very similar). The idea of taxing digital giants is a consensus among all the lists, as is the one on paraffin (except for LR and RN). LREM even pledges to end the EU's fiscal unanimity to get around blockages.. All the lists finally agree to fight more against tax evasion, but it is the left-wing parties that go the furthest: PS-PP asks for the evaluation of annual losses linked to evasion and LFI and EELV promise to enlarge the black list of tax havens to European countries that do not play the game according to them, including Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands."
"On the opening day of the first session of the new Parliament, British MPs from Nigel Farage's Brexit party engaged in a particularly ""regressive"" provocation. They deliberately turned their backs when the first notes of the European anthem, Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"", sounded. Members of the Rassemblement National chose to remain seated.It is precisely because this form of ""banality of unculturedness and contempt"" is developing in the European Union that the choice of ""Team Europe"" is essential."
"On the other hand, the British Tories were the most pro-European party in Britain in the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher, the Tory leader, campaigned to remain in the European Economic Community, the predecessor of the EU, in 1975 before the referendum confirming membership. Forty years later, the same party led the way out of the community. Today, unfortunately, PiS is closer to the contemporary British Conservative Party. The key to potential change lies in the universal, not national, Catholic Church."
"On the other hand, we have to vote on whether Danish companies should be able to grant a unitary patent covering 25 countries (including Denmark) or a unitary patent covering 24 countries. Whether Danes vote yes or no, Danish companies will be able to take out an EU patent. It is optional. And that is good.When we in the Danish People's Party oppose Danish accession to the EU's unitary patent, it is because Denmark - and Danish patent holders - will be better off having an independent patent for Denmark alongside an EU patent covering the other countries. It is a bit like the euro, where it is obviously an advantage for Danish companies, tourists and others not to have to exchange into many different currencies; but where it is also obviously an advantage for Denmark not to participate."
"On the other side of the Channel, the argument will be the opposite: that it is in the interests of citizens to roll back EU membership and get more power back to London. The Danish People's Party and other sceptics will exploit this paradox to the utmost. Why do Danes need to give the EU more power when our historic friends in Britain are just about to take it back, they will ask.This confusion may cause the Danish yes to waver."
"Once again Lucke shows that he is flexible enough to survive in the political business. During the election campaign, the right-wing conservatives in the AfD are pushing for the party to reject Turkey's accession to the EU. This time Lucke is vetoing it, but not out of conviction, but out of tactical calculation:"
"One of the reasons why the previous civil peace on EU policy is breaking up may be the fear among pro-EU parties that the Danish People's Party will win votes on the basis of its anti-EU stance. At the same time, many parties perceive Danes to be on the sceptical side when it comes to the EU. Therefore, they are increasingly trying to show that they also set limits.The Danish People's Party has undoubtedly spoken clearly to the Danes in connection with the child benefit case, and consistency and offensive lines are traditionally rewarded by voters. But there is no evidence in existing opinion polls to say that Danes in general have become more sceptical about the EU."
Open is also the question whether the donations are related to the efforts of the FPÖ leadership to forge a new broader alliance of right-wing nationalist parties. FPÖ Secretary General Harald Vilimsky confirmed on Tuesday that such an alliance of all three EU-critical groups in the European Parliament could become reality as early as April.
"Opposing the Nice Treaty in 2001, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said it would 'bring us closer into a European army and into Nato'. In a campaign against the EU Reform Treaty, he claimed it would lead to a greater militarisation of the EU.Every argument that Sinn Féin has put forward on this issue over the past 47 years has proved false and has been without foundation.The reality is Irish troops cannot serve on peacekeeping missions abroad unless it is with the approval of Dáil Éireann, the Irish government and under a specific United Nations resolution."
"Opposition to Euro-incursion into nation state laws and polity can no longer be ignored or dismissed as whacky. Sinn Fein, now with four MEPs who espouse Euro critical views unlike the Eurosceptic UKIP, have an opportunity to make a difference to the shallow and moribund political discourse which has passed for debate about Europe up till now in this country.Like it or not, Sinn Fein take their politics seriously."
"PARIS Pierre Moscovici's long day begins with a working breakfast at the Commission's representation in Paris, before Strasbourg. As Marine Le Pen had done the day before in Nanterre, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs presents his New Year wishes to the press and sets out his vision for 2018. The March 4 elections appear to be a key junction for Europe, and if the leader of the Front National rejoiced on Monday trusting in a victory of the variously anti-EU forces - from the League to the Five Star Movement -, Moscovici is worried and speaks of a political risk.Italy is preparing for elections with an uncertain outcome."
"PBP-AAA TD Richard Boyd Barrett said his group would meet in the next couple of weeks to make a decision on whether it would campaign either way in the referendum. The issue of a possible Brexit was serious, not just for Ireland and Britain but for the whole of the EU, he said.Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman Seán Crowe, whose party favours remaining in the EU, acknowledged that among many of the electorate in Britain, there is a genuine disaffection, dissatisfaction and disagreement with many of the things coming out of the EU."
"PVV, CDA, ChristenUnie and SGP are upset about the billions in aid Egypt may receive from the European Union. Minister Frans Timmermans (Foreign Affairs) said Tuesday that there are no new commitments and that the loans will only be provided if Egypt meets the EU's requirements for democracy and human rights. The PVV is strongly against the support of around 5 billion euros because the Egyptian president is a virulent anti-Semite, wants to introduce sharia law in Egypt and oppresses women and Christians. The governing VVD party is also critical."
"Panic last Friday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Saturday on the front page of the Volkskrant. But what is going on at all? On June 16, a week before the Brexit, the AEX was at 418. Voice boss? PVV and SP are now calling for a Dutch referendum on the EU. Let's wait five years or so to do that."
"Parties are not responsible. Does Podemos' anti-austerity discourse contribute to the negative view of Europe and therefore to Euroscepticism? It is that what comes from the EU is negative, the problem is not that we say so, it is that it is an absolutely failed political and economic paradigm, answers Pablo Bustinduy, secretary of International Relations of Pablo Iglesias' party. Those who are destroying the European project are the financial and political elites, he says."
"Parties without roots in the center of power are typically advocates of asking the people. Since the 1973 landslide elections, the view has thrived in first the Progress Party and later the Danish People's Party - in line with the parties on the far left.Since Brexit was a reality, we have seen the current most pronounced in Enhedslisten.On the other hand, the Japanese - most notably the V and S - have been blunt in their rejection of any talk of a referendum."
"Party points out that Denmark will also become a full member of the Schengen cooperation with open internal borders in Europe if the opt-in system is partially activated. DF's EU spokesman, Kenneth Kristensen Berth, argues that even a limited special deal could fulfil the party's promises, even though it would not be full membership. We have always said that what was essential for us was access to registers."
"PiS has also invited the leader of Italy's Northern League, Matteo Salvini, but he will not come. He is supposed to be unhappy because PiS is strengthening itself in the structures of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). Wyborcza wrote that Salvini will take advantage of Kaczynski's invitation to defend Europe together, because something very bad is happening on Europe's border. He was also scheduled to speak with the leader of the Law and Justice party about the new balance of power."
"PiS so far does not say when and where Salvini's meeting with PiS president Jaroslaw Kaczynski will take place, with whom, PiS politicians suggest, the Northern League leader will talk about &bdquo;EU problems and immigration, but mainly about creating a new Eurosceptic faction in the European Parliament after elections in May. According to our information, which is also reported by the Italian daily &bdquo;La Repubblica, Salvini will have a joint conference with Kaczynski before 5 p.m. at the PiS headquarters in Nowogrodzka.0"
"Pitella thus tried to court approval in his group until the last moment. Unlike the Greens, the Left Group and also most of the non-attached EU-sceptics from the right-wing parties (including four FPÖ MPs), who reject TTIP in principle, the Social Democrats presented themselves divided on several occasions. Only Christian Democrats (EPP), Liberals (ALDE) and Conservatives (ECR) wanted to vote clearly in favour of the Lange Report."
"Points to remember The National Front conveys a message of hatred and contempt for European construction.Europe is, however, the most accomplished system of cooperation between peoples to date."
"Politicians who still want to help Greece should be honest about the reasoning: support banks in Western Europe. Every hypocritical statement about solidarity within the euro or the EU drives angry voters to SP and PVV.But at least those voters--with their own interpretation, but that's not what this is about now--see the priorities correctly: loyal to Dutch seniors and Dutch schools, and thus no cuts in pensions or layoffs of teachers to free up money for the Greeks, who, after all the miserable decline since 2008, are still on average richer than citizens in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and six other EU member states."
"Polls Opinion polls carried out in Northern Ireland in recent months suggest a majority of 53-55 per cent in favour of staying in the EU, with nationalists more likely than unionists to vote to remain. The SDLP and Sinn Féin are on side of remaining. The European Union is by no means perfect, and we are one of the most critical parties of the EU, but it's quite clear that it would have a devastating impact on the island, having one part of the island in the EU and one part out, says Daithí McKay, the Sinn Féin MLA for North Antrim."
"Pretzell was an important tool in the fight against the EU and against Madame The fact that the AfD's second MEP, Beatrix von Storch, has preferred to switch to the more moderate EU opponents does not bother him. What is decisive, he says, are the common interests with the AfD. Would the Front National leadership"
"Prior to her arrival in Dublin around lunchtime, Mrs May will be meeting with Northern Ireland's key political leaders at an event in Wales. The DUP's Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin's new Northern leader Michelle O'Neill are likely to give contrasting views on how they believe Brexit should be handled.The DUP supports the decision to leave the EU, while Sinn Féin is arguing that a majority of citizens of Northern Ireland voted 'Remain'."
"Probably soon, the CJEU will also have to deal with the ongoing January 2016. the PiS government's dispute with the EU over the rule of law. The European Commission has given Warsaw until mid-September to withdraw from amendments to the Supreme Court law allowing a purge of the court and the dismissal of its first president before the end of her term, which is unconstitutional."

"Prognostics say that the anti-EU parties will storm ahead, and in Denmark it will most likely be the Danish People's Party's Morten Messerschmidt who wins. The EU has become one of the DF's most important issues, and there are clear parallels with the party's critical line on immigrants.Within the major centre parties, we can therefore look forward to another long period in which the DF can constantly outbid with scepticism towards foreign stereotypes - this time from Eastern Europe - and exploitation of the Danish welfare system."
"Read also ""Europe's House is on Fire"", the manifesto of European patriots The real issue is elsewhere and will be played out the day after the European elections: will the demagogues of all the European countries be able to unite, which they have never managed to do until now, their only common point being, most of the time, their detestation of the Union and, for a large part of them, their rejection of immigration, but not necessarily of the Muslim religion? It is no coincidence, for example, that Nigel Farage's Ukip has always refused to sit on the same benches as the National Front and that the latter has never wanted to ally itself with the Greek neo-Nazis of Golden Dawn...Since an alliance between the radical left and right is excluded by nature, the question only arises for radical right-wing parties such as Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary, for pure demagogues such as the M5S and for extreme right-wing parties such as the RN, the Belgian Vlaams Belang, the Dutch VVD, etc."
"Regarding the legitimacy of the extension of concessions until 2033, the Council of State, which met on October 20 in plenary session in order to express a unified opinion of the administrative justice on the appeals lodged against the extension, is about to pronounce its decision. Against the reactions of Brussels and in defense of what has been decided with the bill on competition, the League takes sides: No lessons from Europe. The removal of concessions from the competition bill is an act of common sense for many productive realities that are already planning the next season."
"Relations between the Danish parliament and the government are approaching freezing point after the Danes on Thursday turned their thumbs down to transforming the legal reservation into an opt-in system. In Christiansborg, the result has set off an internal political palaver about Denmark's EU policy, which the Danish People's Party and the Greens believe should be changed in a much more sceptical direction in respect of the election result. POLITICS The government is behaving arrogantly when it refuses to make a joint EU agreement with the no parties in Parliament, says the Danish Liberal Democrats, who on the other hand praise the Social Democrats for a change of course on EU policy."

"Right-wing Holland has a new favorite word: cultural Marxism. Thierry Baudet, leader of the Forum for Democracy, called the European Union a cultural Marxist project whose goal is the destruction of European civilization. His kindred spirit Paul Cliteur wrote a column on the website TPO: Cultural Marxists have no rest until you are subdued. On Twitter, many responded in agreement: cultural Marxism, yes, that is exactly the problem we are facing."
"Right-wing populists stir up opposition to EU The euro-critical Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has opened the hot phase of its European election campaign with sharp attacks on EU policies. The European Union is building ""increasingly undemocratic structures to an alarming degree"", said party leader Bernd Lucke on Saturday at the nationwide kick-off event in Cologne.. Former industry president Hans-Olaf Henkel, second behind Lucke on the AfD list for the European elections on 25 May, warned against sacrificing the individual responsibility and competition of EU countries to rampant centralism in order to save the euro."
"Right-wing populists want to enter parliament with protest voters The Alternative for Germany (AfD) wants to make it into the European Parliament with harsh criticism of the EU and votes from protest voters. At a federal party conference in Berlin on Saturday, the party completed its list, having already elected its spokesperson Bernd Lucke and ex-BDI President Hans-Olaf Henkel as top candidates a week earlier in Aschaffenburg."
"Rules of procedure Most of the political groups that spoke after him stressed that his attitude towards the European Union risked having the same effect:For many MEPs, the debate on the Polish issue is actually more political than legal:"" Common values""The representative of the centrist Renew group asked the Commission to act quickly by activating the mechanism that makes the payment of European aid conditional on the respect of the rule of law, and by refusing to provide Poland with the 24 billion euros foreseen by the European recovery plan. Only the sovereignist MEP Nicolas Bay of the Rassemblement National praised the courage of the Polish leader in resisting EU interference:The President of the European Commission said"

STANDARD: I ask because you are in a pro-EU coalition imposed by government programme. Your voters are mostly EU opponents. How does the FPÖ intend to pick them up?Strache:
"STANDARD: So the European partners of the FPÖ, Salvini's Lega or Marine Le Pen in France, say quite openly that they want to break up this EU.Kneissl:"
"STANDARD: The AfD wants to deepen its contacts with the FPÖ. Where do you see common ground? In the criticism of the EU. And the FPÖ is, of course, the party that for decades has had the influx of voters that the AfD would like to see."
STANDARD: The FPÖ wants to form an electoral platform with right-wing populist parties in the EU elections. What role do you play?
"STANDARD: When issuing the government-forming mandate, you do not want to sharpen up after Van der Bellen announced with regard to the FPÖ's hostility to the EU that in the event of a Blue election victory, the person with the most votes would not automatically be entrusted with forming the government?Glawischnig:"
"Salvini has so far left it largely open what his free Europe is supposed to look like in concrete terms. His ideas are based on the programme of the far-right Strasbourg group Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), to which the Lega, the RN and the FPÖ belong: Protection of the external borders, curtailing the competences of the EU Commission while at the same time upgrading the national governments, emphasising the Christian roots of the Union, protecting European companies from cheap competition from the Far East. We don't care about Brussels"
"Salvini, soon to be 45, has transformed the former secessionist Northern League into a sovereignist formation and has hammered out an anti-immigration and anti-European discourse during the campaign that has borne fruit in a country that has seen nearly 700,000 migrants land since 2013. Abroad, Marine Le Pen, president of the French National Front (FN), offered warm congratulations to Mr Salvini, while Nigel Farage, former leader of Britain's pro-Brexit Ukip party, congratulated his M5S colleagues.French President Emmanuel Macron pointed to the high migratory pressure on Italy, while the EU has left Rome to deal with the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have landed over the past five years virtually alone."
"Security Detention, which the now lost FPÖ leader Strache touted as a blue political hit just three weeks ago at the Freedom Party's EU election campaign kick-off. Herbert Kickl, the best interior minister of the Second Republic, would introduce preventive detention and border protection again, Strache announced."
"Show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are: The question of the first visit holds special symbolism in the domestic case. Finally, with the entry of the anti-EU FPÖ, the government seemed to be facing a directional decision. Will Austria remain at the forefront of European integration? Or will the Republic lean on the Visegrád states in the east, which want more nationhood and less EU? The first six months of the Turquoise-Blue period sent signals in both directions."
"Since Volt's founding, populist parties have sprung up all over Europe. In Italy, populists, including Matteo Salvini of the far-right Lega Nord, are in government. In the Netherlands, Forum for Democracy, which promotes a critical EU stance, became the largest party in the Provincial Council elections. Venzon doesn't find that discouraging."
"Since an alliance between the radical left and right is excluded by nature, the question only arises for radical right-wing parties such as Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary, for pure demagogues such as the M5S and for extreme right-wing parties such as the RN, the Belgian Vlaams Belang, the Dutch VVD, etc. For the moment, they are split between three groups (the conservative Eurosceptics of the ECR, the EFDD formed around Ukip and M5S, and the ENL whose backbone is formed by the RN and the League), not to mention a few overly radioactive non-attached members such as the Hungarian Jobbik or Aube Dorée. Matteo Salvini, the Italian interior minister and head of the League, has begun outreach work with Fidesz, PiS and the FPÖ, so far to no avail."
Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said: Under normal circumstances we would allow the British people to control their own destiny. But obviously when they have control over our own island it brings an additional dimension to it in terms of the effects a Brexit would have.Trade relations Sinn Féin's campaign will focus on the potential effects a British exit could have on the Northern Ireland economy and on trade relations between Ireland and Britain. It will also campaign strongly for the outcome of the vote in Northern Ireland to be recognised by the British government.
"Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams TD welcomed the announcement of the referendum date but said that his party would be campaigning vigorously between now and May 31st asking people to vote No. Sinn Féin believes this treaty is bad for Ireland and for the EU and will institutionalise austerity into domestic constitutional law and international law in perpetuity, said Mr Adams.In Washington the Institute of International Finance, a powerful banking lobby which negotiated Greece s EUR 100 billion debt restructuring, said the referendum ranked among the current uncertainties that worried it the most."
"Sinn Féin's record on the European Union is clear, unambiguous and hiding in plain sight. Every time the Irish people were asked to vote on a European referendum, Sinn Féin told them to vote against. They are every bit as negative and obstructionist as Farage when it comes to Europe.In response, a Sinn Féin spokesperson said dragging up the video was a desperate attempt by Brendan Smith to save his flagging campaign by spreading false representations."
"Sir, Despite condemnation of those supporting the EU fiscal treaty as Thatcherite (Home News, April 26th), Mr Adams appears to owe one or two things himself to the Iron Lady. His No! No! No! attitude of handing over power to unelected officials and bureaucrats in the EU Commission echoes Thatcher s own anti-European stance.A good publicity campaign by Sinn Féin is what is needed here, and its pamphlet phrase Austerity isn t working could be a winner. Mrs T would certainly approve, after all her party s ad campaign Labour isn t working helped sweep the Conservatives to power in 1979."
"So I think in one way or another that you are acting in a way that is fair to the population, says the DF's foreign affairs spokesman, Søren Espersen, who stresses that this is not the first time that Danes have shown a great deal of EU scepticism. Three times the Danes have voted no to more EU. If you look at the EU parliamentary elections, the Danish People's Party became twice as large as the Liberal Party in terms of seats, Espersen explains.The current European political agreement is from 2008 and defines Denmark's relationship with the EU in the long term."
"So what? So the Rassemblement National and the League share the same considerations: the EU is a toxic accelerator of massive immigration and Frontex is the agency of reception, accompaniment and distribution. As for the Commission, it does not want to stop or regulate immigration: it wants to intensify it, as the European Commissioners say."
"So why, therefore, are Sinn Féin MEPs, amongst others, opposing a measure that can help in tracking terrorist suspects? Why are they opposed to this? Is it to do with their recent annoyance with US authorities as they stopped and questioned some Sinn Féin members who have known criminal pasts? Whatever the reason, it's time to take this issue seriously and to pass this crucial legislation at an EU level this week. The text of this proposal has been negotiated between the EU Council and the EU Parliament for five long years, yet in the wake of the Paris attacks one Sinn Féin MEP called it a knee-jerk reaction.There is nothing knee jerk about a measure which has been debated and discussed for five years."
"Social Democrat member of the European Affairs Committee, Peter Hummelgaard, will not answer whether the party will support a possible referendum, but even more remarkably, the Social Democrat suggests that the government may not be doing enough to get the parallel agreement. It is an echo of the criticism that has caused bad blood between the Left and the Danish parliament.Japanese parties must hope that it does not come to that. That the EU Commission and the other EU countries listen to Lars Løkke Rasmussen's appeal at this week's crisis summit in Brussels for an EU that is a little more responsive, a little more flexible, and that during the autumn Denmark is allowed to stay in Europol, even though we maintained our legal reservation with the EU referendum.If not, the Japanese may well end up in a serious fix."
"Somewhat more insight into Austria's position is provided by the voting behaviour in the EU Parliament: SPÖ and Neos voted against the restrictions, as did the Greens with the exception of MEP Sarah Wiener. The FPÖ and ÖVP spoke out in favour of the proposed changes at EU level.Criticism of over-regulation"
"Standard that Team Stronach is not contesting the EU election increases the FPÖ's chances of attracting more protest votes. In the National Council election, Stronach's party had 268,679 votes."
Standard: And the European issue? Is it enough for the FPÖ that Sebastian Kurz now also wants to cut social benefits for EU citizens and family allowances?Haimbuchner:
"Standard: Chancellor Kurz has pulled the EU competence all over himself, could he pull the FPÖ over the coals via Europe?Vilimsky:"
Standard: Criticism of the EU is an asset of the FPÖ. That attracts voters.
Standard: The Haider FPÖ was vehemently against EU accession in 1994. Was that pro-European?
Standard: This is what the FPÖ is trying to do with your very approach of addressing EU mistakes. Martin:
"Standing in the shadow of the Europa building at the most recent EU summit, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin made it very clear that his party was committed to Ireland staying in Europe. Inside the conference centre a few hours later, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar repeated his mantra that Ireland was fully signed up to the EU for the long haul.Even Sinn Féin, whose EU policies 30 years ago mirrored those of Maggie Thatcher, has moved a deal more towards critical engagement. It is hard to find a mainstream voice advocating that Ireland leave the EU and go it alone."
"Still in the Belgian capital, British Eurosceptic leader Nigel Farage of Ukip, who scored a victory similar to Le Pen's by promising the UK's exit from the EU, met for lunch with Beppe Grillo of the 5 Star Movement. He intends to convince him to join his group (to which in the past the Northern League adhered). Farage has ruled out joining Le Pen's group considering his French colleague racist and anti-Semitic. In the Europarliament at least 25 deputies from seven member countries are needed to form a group, indispensable if a minimum of opposition to the majority is to be implemented, generally formed by the Popular Party (Ppe) and Socialists (Pse), this time perhaps also with the Liberals (Alde)."
"Strache's FPÖ is not coincidentally in the right-wing group with Le Pen's Front National in the EU Parliament. Their Europe has little or nothing to do with this EU. The acid test for Turquoise-Blue will therefore only come if the FPÖ gets key ministerial posts: Finance, foreign, interior and economic ministers must be pro-European in real life."
"Strache: Especially in an election debate, it is important to visibly highlight the differences between the FPÖ and the ÖVP. But in the EU election, no members of the government will be running against each other. It's just a pity that Christian Kern is not running (laughs)."
"Strasbourg. The two FPÖ MEPs, Andreas Mölzer and Franz Obermayr, voted this week against an end to the European Parliament's travelling circus. They said no to the push for a free election of the parliamentary seat, which was supported by a large majority of MPs."
"Strasbourg/Vienna The FPÖ's head of delegation in the EU Parliament, Secretary General Harald Vilimsky, sees no reason for his party to change its EU-sceptical course because of government participation. The FPÖ was actually the first European party ever in the country, he said in the Standard interview in Strasbourg.Man has always said that we want a Europe on the model of Charles de Gaulle, a Europe of nations, where everyone can find a place even before Jörg Haider became party leader in 1986."
"Strasbourg/Vienna The FPÖ's head of delegation in the EU Parliament, Secretary General Harald Vilimsky, sees no reason for his party to change its EU-sceptical course because of government participation. The FPÖ was actually the first ever European party in the country, he said in the Standard interview in Strasbourg."
"THE DISCUSSION on the EU and welfare benefits is driven not least by the forecasts for the upcoming European Parliament elections, which will be held between 22 and 25 May. Prognostics say that the anti-EU parties will storm ahead, and in Denmark it will most likely be the Danish People's Party's Morten Messerschmidt who wins. The EU has become one of the DF's most important issues, and there are clear parallels with the party's critical line on immigrants."
"THE GERMAN PEOPLE'S PARTY is pushing hard to maintain a negative debate on the EU, setting limits on the EU and limiting cooperation. A number of business leaders have strongly warned against reintroducing border controls with other EU countries because it would hinder the single market and contravene EU Schengen rules.DF has not let this stop it, and the party still hopes to convince Danes that border controls should be reintroduced.In February 2015, Epinion made a measurement for DR, which showed that 61%."
"Tajani is convinced to add to the 217 votes of the Ppe the 74 conservative Ecr. Uncertain appears the support of the 40 Eurosceptic Enf of the French Marine Le Pen and the League of Matteo Salvini. Pittella negotiated with the left-wing Gue (52 votes), the Greens (51 votes) and many individual MPs."
"That in itself is a blatant accusation against a government that it is willing to risk Danish interests to advance a political point. Kristian Thulesen Dahl may have a point in that the EU and some countries do not want to signal to Britain's voters before their EU referendum in June that they can just get a special deal. The Danish People's Party should have taken this political reluctance into account before the vote.If there is no progress in the negotiations on a parallel agreement by the end of autumn, it would be obvious to go to plan B."
"That includes a discreet consensus that hangover of the 2008 crash will remain with us, in the form of the (EURO)200bn of national debt the State is saddled with, and which no party is committing to bring down in hard-cash terms from anything but windfalls. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil stress their commitment to the State's totemic 12.5pc corporation tax rate and to defend its veto over tax matters in the European Union. Even Sinn Féin, whose move to tax multinationals' intellectual property portfolios was by far the most radical proposal on offer, also said it would keep the 12.5pc rate.The party's tax proposal on multinationals was less radical than some of the headlines might suggest - it would introduce an 80pc cap on profits offset by capital allowances for intangible assets onshored between 2015 and 2018."
"That is the best way forward and it is imperative that the whole island of Ireland remains in the EU together to protect trade, jobs and citizens' rights. I found the Taoiseach's comments last week hugely disappointing, she said referring to the Government's refusal to back the Sinn Féin proposal that the North be afforded a special designated status within the EU. We are currently on a diplomatic offensive across Europe where we are finding a lot of sympathy for the North to remain."
"That is why Margrete Auken hopes that the French will now be impressed by the fact that the parliamentarians have received the word of the Court of Auditors that it is an expensive affair. But I must admit that I am sceptical, says the EU veteran.In the Danish People's Party, Anders Vistisen believes that the bureaucracy in the EU is hard to dance with and that the extravagant treatment of parliamentarians is excessive. We have separate entrances to the buildings, separate restaurants and free limousine service if we need it."
"That is your interpretation. How will you confront Frank Stronach thematically? He is similar to the FPÖ in many areas, for example in his criticism of the EU.I do not change my topics, I remain consistent - and represent the interests of Austrians where I am in charge."
"That the FPÖ in particular had advocated not expelling any Russian diplomat was denied by both governing parties on Tuesday. However, it is no secret that substantial parts of the FPÖ would rather fulfil the Kremlin's demands sooner rather than later: end the EU sanctions and recognise Crimea as part of Russia. The list of FPÖ politicians who have travelled to Crimea or attended events organised by Kremlin lobbyists is long."
"That the FPÖ will have reason to celebrate this Sunday became apparent early on. After all, there was a lot to be said for it: for many EU sceptics, the FPÖ was the only mouthpiece. This is because Hans-Peter Martin, who was able to convince some voters of his merits in 2009, did not run again."
"That will not happen. Support for the EU is higher among Danish voters than in Britain, and the Danish People's Party has rightly postponed a Danish EU referendum to an uncertain future. The British exit also holds opportunities - and pitfalls - for Denmark."
"That would be a first of its kind in the 40 years of existence of the European Parliament, which, with all its political differences, has always been the bastion of proponents of more Europe. This is the revolution Salvini dreamed of last weekend in Milan at a meeting with kindred spirits like Marine Le Pen (Rassemblement National, France), Geert Wilders (PVV, Netherlands) and Jörg Meuthen (AfD, Germany). Le Pens party may become the largest in France, just like Lega in Italy and Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the United Kingdom."
"The 2006 referendum was also about making the patent system more flexible, which also meant that Denmark lost sovereignty. At the time, the Danish People's Party aired its scepticism, but argued that the interests of business came first.The Danish People's Party's EU spokesperson, Pia Adelsteen, states that it is a matter of principle for us that the Danes should be consulted when sovereignty is ceded. That's how it is."
"The Court ensures, among other things. a. that patents should only be applied for in one country rather than 25 - this should improve competitiveness so that the EU can better compete with patent rules in e.g. the US and Japan.Enhedslisten, DF and LA are against, so a referendum will probably be needed to decide Danish support.0"
"The DUP's Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin's new Northern leader Michelle O'Neill are likely to give contrasting views on how they believe Brexit should be handled. The DUP supports the decision to leave the EU, while Sinn Féin is arguing that a majority of citizens of Northern Ireland voted 'Remain'.In advance of that meeting, Mrs May said she hoped the talks would be constructive but warned they will not agree on everything."
"The Danish People's Party can almost be called a secret yes party, says Nadja Schou Lauridsen, a lawyer at the think tank Europa. The Danish People's Party's behaviour is unique, says Rasmus Brun Pedersen, a researcher in EU and Danish foreign policy at Aarhus University. The Danish People's Party is a declared Eurosceptic party, but is in fact helping to keep its hand under Danish EU commitments."
"The Danish People's Party chairman stressed that the strong support for a no vote should give rise to a change of course in Danish EU policy. The latest Europe agreement between the Japanese parties is based on 'Denmark being as close to the core of the EU as possible', and that Denmark should have 'fewer - not more - reservations'.The DF chairman believes that the government must now take the initiative to make a Europe policy agreement that, as something new, involves the Eurosceptic parties and takes Denmark further away from the core of the EU. The result contrasts with the idea that we need to get closer to the heart of the EU and give up more and more sovereignty."
"The Danish People's Party has also succeeded in turning the vote into an issue of refugee and immigration policy and into a discussion about distrust of politicians. Once again, the party has insisted that it could not trust Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's (V) guarantee that Denmark will not become part of an EU asylum policy without a new referendum.The party held yesterday a 'DF Classic party' in the Parliament's restaurant, Snapstinget, with pork roast, meatballs and red-and-white tablecloths on the café tables.When Kristian Thulesen Dahl took the stage late in the evening, he thought he must be in the best room at Christiansborg."
"The Danish People's Party has lost all appetite for a possible referendum on more EU. What in December was the party's own declared plan B, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth today calls a form of advanced masochism. The Danish People's Party is criticised for breaking promises, and the party's defence is pointed.DF's Morten Messerschmidt thought he could give the Danes a guarantee of continued membership of Europol after a no vote."
"The Danish People's Party met yesterday with the presumably future Prime Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V), to explore the possibilities of a government cooperation, where the Danish People's Party has a more sceptical EU line as one of their main demands. However, according to Deputy Chairman of the Danish People's Party Peter Skaarup, the Danish People's Party's EU scepticism also matches the higher priorities among Danes. Our scepticism towards the EU should not be interpreted as only wanting to limit social benefits."
"The Danish People's Party's behaviour is unique, says Rasmus Brun Pedersen, a researcher in EU and Danish foreign policy at Aarhus University. The Danish People's Party is a declared Eurosceptic party, but is in fact helping to keep its hand under Danish EU commitments.Normally, parties critical of the EU do so only if they are part of the European political agreement between parties that have committed themselves to upholding Danish commitments in the EU."
"The Danish People's Party's problem in the debate will be that it makes little sense to open up an opt-in system if it is all about Europol. A whole range of other things - such as a European register of air passengers, participation in Eurojust cooperation between prosecutors and courts, the fight against human trafficking and cybercrime - are just as important, and the DF has nothing against them either.If the Danes have to go to a referendum on every new step forward in EU judicial and police cooperation, it will be a time-consuming and uncertain uphill struggle that is unlikely to promote the country's security.-- The government and the parliamentary majority have good arguments in that part of the debate."
"The Danish opposition has demanded a referendum. . As a matter of principle, we believe that when something is a transfer of sovereignty, the people must be consulted, says Morten Messerschmidt, EU parliamentarian for the Danish People's Party (DF), to Ritzau.0"
"The EPP's condition for serious talks is an end to Poland's two-year dispute with the European Commission over the rule of law. Last December, the Commission initiated proceedings in this case under Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which theoretically could lead to sanctions against Poland. Law and Justice politicians, in turn, began to pressure Brussels to drop the proceedings, despite the fact that the government has not withdrawn from the provisions of the so-called Lisbon Treaty, criticized by the commission. judicial reform."
"The European Commission has been working on the issue for some time now, but it has not yet been able to find a solution to the problem. The European Commission has been working on the issue for some time now, but it has not yet been able to find a solution to the problem, and it has not yet been able to find a solution to the problem. The inversion of values and mass immigration advocated by the EU are once again rejected, rejoiced the leader of the French National Front, Marine le Pen, whose congratulations were added to those of the Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders, representatives of the German nationalist party AfD, the British pro-Brexit MP Nigel Farage, and the leader of the Italian far-right party The League, Matteo Salvini, who has been vying for the post of Prime Minister since the elections of 4 March.In addition to the axis formed with his Central European neighbours, Viktor Orban claimed during his campaign that he wanted to work with Italy and Austria on an alliance of countries hostile to Muslim immigration."
"The European Parliament backed a resolution, proposed by the four major political groupings, which called on the UK to respect the wish of a majority of EUs citizens, entirely, fully and as soon as possible, by officially withdrawing from the EU before any new relationship arrangements can be made. The decision was taken by the parliament after an extraordinary plenary debate, during which MEPs also stressed the urgent need for reforms to ensure the EU lives up to its citizens' expectations. Aggressive stance Sinn Féin adopted a more aggressive line in the parliament, tabling a number of amendments to the resolution. After the debate, Martina Anderson, Sinn Féin's Northern Ireland MEP, said the party amendments urged the parliament to take note of, and respect, the result of the referendum, and to also respect the fact that the North of Ireland and Scotland had voted to remain in the EU."
"The European Parliament's Nicolas Bay, who has been nominated to lead the RN list for the European elections, admitted on RFI that the question of the euro's viability was a long-term one. It's complicated for the RN to say that it's easy to leave the EU when the Brexit is not really a success,"" says Mr. Gauthier. Camus."
"The European elites, by continuing with this strategy of globalism, are totally at odds with history and the world and the choices that the great nations of the world are making today, she said. In Europe, she also sees a rise in the power of sovereignist parties, citing the entry into the Austrian government of the far-right FPÖ party, the alliance in Italy of those who oppose this prison vision of Europe leading in the polls (Matteo Salvini's Northern League, close to the FN, allied with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the small post-fascist party Fratelli d'Italia, NDLR), its own accession to the second round of the presidential elections in France, or the rise of the far-right AfD party in Germany.She said she agreed with the Italian 5-Star Movement's (M5S, populist) criticism of EU economic rules but denounced its pro-immigration speeches in the European Parliament."
"The FN promises everything to everyone! On the international level, the FN would lead us to isolation and to a break with our allies (NATO, the European Union).On immigration, you attack the FN on its credibility more than on moral grounds"
"The FPÖ candidate's statements in themselves, especially the comparison of the Union with the Third Reich, do not please Strache. The FPÖ leader calls it a pointed and exaggerated comparison to the EU's regulatory frenzy, but such considerations should generally not be made and should be refrained from. Mölzer had also apologised for his choice of words after a frank conversation with him."
"The FPÖ has also made its mark on the left by criticising globalisation, specifically the free trade agreements TTIP and Ceta. The latter is a source of conflict for the coalition in the making: Kurz has advocated that the National Council ratify the controversial part of the agreement with Canada, for which it needs the sanction of the national parliaments in the EU. The FPÖ is against this and demands a referendum.The government can avoid a row by not submitting Ceta for ratification at all, which would mean that the ÖVP would have to sacrifice the goal of trade liberalisation for reasons of coalition."
"The FPÖ's comparatively frothy election campaign was certainly also due to party leader Heinz-Christian Strache's desire to appear as fit for Chancellor as possible and not to alienate too many voters. Because the FPÖ is certain of the EU- and Euro-critical votes anyway. Some of the voters who voted for Hans-Peter Martin in 2009 - after all, almost 18 percent - will articulate their protest by voting for the Freedom Party."
"The Finance Minister's tone was in marked contrast with his public utterances in 2011-12 when Ireland's hand was in the EU bailout dog's mouth. But Mr Noonan's shift in emphasis was well topped by Sinn Féin, which had solidly called No in nine consecutive EU referendum campaigns from 1972 until 2012. Now, in what must surely be the most contentious call ever by the EU authorities involving Ireland, Sinn Féin goes all pro-Brussels.This is not about the EU trying to encroach on our tax sovereignty."
The Foreign Minister's frustration is both honestly meant and nuancedly expressed at a time when Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II. But it is precisely this kind of ambiguity in relation to the EU's common immigration policy that the Danish People's Party will try to expose in its upcoming campaign for a no to loosening the legal reservation.That is why the government and the parties to the agreement are wise to insist that this referendum is about Europol.
The Freedom Party lives on a completely different star. FPÖ MEPs vote against most of the proposals being discussed in the EU Parliament.
"The French counterpart of DR 1 is not the only one who, in the light of the British vote, is interested in the line of the DF. In recent months, foreign experts, politicians and the media have taken a keen interest in what the Danish People's Party thinks about the UK's upcoming referendum, which could have major consequences for the whole of EU cooperation. The Japanese TV station NHK has also asked the EU rapporteur whether the powerful eurosceptics in Denmark could push for a Danish exit and thus contribute to a potential domino effect."
The Greens are thus dancing out of opposition line. BZÖ and Team Stronach also criticise the coalition - but analogously to the FPÖ for the fact that Austria still transfers far too much to the EU. A motion of no confidence in the government fizzled out as usual due to the lack of a majority.
"The Greens were against this at the time, but they soon came to their senses. The FPÖ was against this and has basically remained so to this day. The FPÖ before Jörg Haider was originally in favour of joining the EU, but because they thought that would be Greater Germany. Haider immediately saw that he could collect votes from the roughly 25 per cent of hard-line EU opponents and forced a futile No vote with idiotic arguments Schildlausjoghurt."
"The Health Minister went into more detail about the need for a European vaccine procurement, which he also justifies several times a day in interviews. The interesting thing is that, apart from the AfD, no group criticises the common path of the EU. This was also emphasised by FDP leader Christian Lindner and Social Democrat Schneider again in the Bundestag."
"The Irish decision is a good reminder that it should be put to a referendum in Denmark too. The Danish People's Party's EU spokesperson, Pia Adelsteen, has the same view. You should learn from the Irish, whether you have the same relationship or not."
"The Liberals will be needed because certainly not all of them will carry the programme of an anti-Putin and pro-European reform coalition and otherwise the majority will be too narrow. Two legislative periods would be necessary, so that not everyone is just watching each other, virtually jumping to the pro-Putin and anti-EU parties. It is true that Russia's role is more visible today in the FPÖ, but since 1945 the SPÖ has been the instrument of Russian interests in Austria.If one wants to cooperate with the Greens in the long run, one must not go easy on the SPÖ with the intention of changing tomorrow."
"The Minister addressed the issue of relations with Italy during the broadcast Le Grand Rendez-vous organized by Europe 1 radio, CNews TV and the economic newspaper Les Echos. Le Maire spoke about many topics of French domestic policy, from the government's employment policy to Air France, but when asked about Italy he did not back down, going so far as to challenge the possible anti-EU choices of a government formed by Matteo Salvini's Lega, known in France as Marine Le Pen's ally in the European Parliament.Everyone in Italy must understand that the future of Italy is in Europe and nowhere else, and because this future is in Europe there are rules to be respected."
The Netherlands was the biggest advocate for upgrading Euro Commissioner Rehn to mister Euro. Brussels officials and diplomats call it a mockery that PVV leader Wilders puts down the 3% rule as a dictate from Brussels. They point out that Wilders has never opposed tightening the rules.
"The PVV is the fiercest Dutch opposition party: in three-quarters of the votes, the PVV disagrees with the majority of the Europarliament. When the PVV does vote with a majority, these are proposals that are rejected, and therefore not only the PVV but also other parties go too far. For instance, the PVV and D66 voted against a proposal that all EU member states should introduce a corporate income tax of at least 20%, or that the EU should be allowed to set stricter conditions for the minimum wage.Also SP and PvdD are among the brighter opposition parties - they vote against the majority position in just over half the cases."
"The People's Movement will not choose its next top candidate until the national meeting at the end of October, which means that he or she will be able to gain almost six months' experience in Brussels before the Danish media begin to deal with EU policy in earnest again. DF: Voters must be disappointed From the other EU critical party in Denmark, the Danish People's Party, MEP Morten Messerschmidt wonders. People who have voted for Søren Søndergaard have done so in the expectation of getting him a prominent political post."
"The SNP does not want Scotland to be ruled from London and opposes a hard Brexit and Conservative austerity policies, but is far more effective by putting forward its views in the chamber of the House of Commons. Given that Sinn Féin has changed its attitude to the European Union, surely a similar change to actually voting and being counted when decisions affecting this island at Westminster are being taken is now warranted? - Is mise, Cllr MALCOLM BYRNE,"
"The SNP's demand for a separate vote on EU membership has now been matched by a similar one from Sinn Féin for Northern Ireland. Martin McGuinness argued that British withdrawal from the EU would be disastrous for Northern Ireland. This is a significant development of Sinn Féin's policy towards the EU, going beyond its traditional scepticism towards a more nuanced position.Armstrong argues that a Conservative-led government will proceed to hold a referendum on UK membership of the EU."
"The SPÖ does not want to commit to any concrete figures. The FPÖ insists on quick deportations, because the capacities for taking in asylum seekers have long been exceeded : Austria should have closed its borders to migrants long ago , according to FPÖ Secretary General Herbert Kickl.The refugees for whom Hungary was the first EU country and who entered Austria afterwards cannot be sent back to Hungary in any case. Not only a case-by-case review by the Administrative Court (VwGH) has prohibited this."
"The Schengen Agreement, which led to the abolition of border controls, is to be widely suspended by the FPÖ. In addition, competences must be transferred back from Brussels to the national parliaments and direct democracy must be expanded, Vilimsky says. The FPÖ politician comments on the fact that these are not exactly small things, but things that would only be feasible with major changes to the EU treaties: That's what politicians are there for, to change treaties. He was not fundamentally against European cooperation, but only against exaggerated cooperation. Vilimsky: This is the last chance for the EU."
"The Schüssel I government failed not as a result of Haider's destructive obstructionism, but due to the fact that FPÖ Vice-Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer shamelessly lied to the Freedom Party base, specifically the party conference delegates, on the question of the Czech Republic's accession to the EU, and wanted to agree to the Czech Republic's admission to the EU despite the continued existence of the Benegsh Decrees, contrary to the will of the party base. At the FPÖ federal party conference in April 2002, she had clearly stated that the FPÖ would not agree to Czech accession to the EU as long as the Czech Republic adhered to the Benegsh Decrees and the impunity law for the crimes committed against the Sudeten Germans. At the same time, she had already agreed with Chancellor Schüssel that the FPÖ would be content with a formal protest and would not offer any real opposition to EU enlargement."
"The Sinn Féin motion also called for quarterly reports to the Dáil by the Government on Brexit negotiations and for all of Ireland to remain within the EU after Brexit. During a Dáil debate on Wednesday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan had warned against Ireland seeking special status because it would risk undermining the Government's efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island after Brexit.The Government submitted an amendment to Sinn Féin's motion in support of this approach. This was rejected by 84 votes to 59 yesterday, although it was supported by Independents Noel Grealish, Michael Lowry and Michael Harty."
"The aforementioned political commentators and analysts had not seen in their crystal balls that Anders Samuelsen would become foreign minister, because he has reportedly never shown any particular interest in foreign policy. That would be not so long ago, when he tried to relaunch the Liberal Alliance as an even more anti-EU party than the Danish People's Party.A line he had to renounce, of course, as soon as he had been given the title of foreign minister. But that was only a small part of the long camel caravan that Anders Samuelsen had to swallow to get a share of government power, because he and his liberal colleagues have taken on a whole lot of ministerial posts, but their issues don't take up much space in the otherwise very orderly government basis."
"The amount is about 34 times higher than the 49 million. The Danish People's Party makes it clear that the government cannot simply count on support for the DKK 1.7 billion, which the Finance Committee agreed before the summer holidays to spend on reserving 27,000 m2 in the Ørestad domicile Copenhagen Towers for six months while the EU countries decide on a future location for the EMA's 890 highly trained staff. kr."
"The answer to the question of which party can benefit the most from this is clear: Wilders' PVV finds a gap in the electoral market at every election until now, and in 2012 it can be found in the anti-European corner. If the PVV succeeds in putting the dislike of the EU on the agenda, Europe will be the dominant theme in Dutch elections for the first time. There is plenty of room for an anti-European campaign."
"The anxiety about immigration and the loss of sovereignty to the EU is also present in Germany, England, France and virtually all other European countries. Thulesen Dahl does not have the aggressive attitude and personality that you find in Geert Wilders or Marine Le Pen. Instead of a breakthrough for that camp, the Danish People's Party can be the party that puts an end to right-wing populism as we know it in Europe, because they address a genuine concern in a way that is universally accepted, he says.0"
"The attempt is to correct the image of a backtrack, after the liquidating judgments against the Commission expressed in the past by its two vice-premiers. But the feeling is that the EU is feeling strong, and has put M5S and Lega on the defensive. The decision on Italy will depend on an opportunity assessment: whether it costs more to hit it or to save it."
"The biggest bone of contention, however, remained the Dexit. If the EU does not reform itself within the next five years, Germany should leave the community, the AfD's European manifesto demands. Party leader Jörg Meuthen, an MEP since the end of 2017, is against a Dexit. He would like to weaken the passage."
"The case has become a dispute about voter fraud. The Danish People's Party and the Green Party assured Danes ahead of the Danish EU referendum in December that they could have a parallel agreement with the EU on Europol if they voted no to full membership through the so-called opt-in system.-- The government and the other Japanese, on the other hand, said it would be difficult and at best protracted."
"The couple took the decision to do something after the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump. Their concern: The EU could break apart due to the growing success of its enemies, Marine Le Pen, but also the AfD. The Röders formulated an appeal, which they spread via Facebook."
"The current flashpoints relate to gross mismanagement of the 2016 EU-UK divorce process which does pose a lethal threat to the 1998 deal and the resultant fragile peace. Much depended on Ireland, north and south, being part of the EU.Sinn Féin is not so much in the direct fray. But their very belated support of the European Union - an isolated first in the 2016 referendum since 1973 - was barely convincing."
"The debate has long smouldered in the Danish population, but during the intense election campaign leading up to 25 May it gathered momentum, taking it to unprecedented heights. While it was less surprising that traditional Eurosceptic parties such as the Danish People's Party and Enhedslisten used welfare tourism as an argument for limiting the EU's influence, it was remarkable to see how the traditionally pro-EU centre parties, led by the Left and the Social Democrats, felt pressured to - if not outbid - then at least to mark themselves as critical of the EU, including. a."
"The dialogue with Brussels The Conte government has from the outset held firm on the main choices included in the economic maneuver, negotiating with Brussels that demanded corrective action1Tensions between the EU and the majorityBetween the Lega-M5S executive and the EU there have been tensions. Brussels also rejected the maneuver, opening the way to a possible infringement procedure"
"The difference is the citizen, who no longer swallows the ever-increasing Brussels interference. The protest is growing, look at Grillo's Five Star Party in your country, the PVV in the Netherlands, Front National in France, Ukip in Britain. They demand participation and referendums."
"The dirty in Austria is no coincidence. Everything is at stake . Since 1986, politics has often been paralysed by the eternally evil bickering of red-black and the scenario that the EU-sceptical FPÖ would make the breakthrough and become chancellor. And now? The SPÖ and ÖVP suffer from a political lack of libido."
"The distance between Warsaw and Brussels was constantly increasing. A year ago, the Law and Justice party decided that a conflict with the EU would not harm Poland, because after Brexit the EU, in order to survive, would have to limit itself, e.g. reduce the catalog of obligations of member countries (otherwise voluntarily accepted by them) and go back to a simple free trade area agreement."

"The economy is growing strongly and the Government's 2016 Budget estimated the national debt-to-GDP ratio fell well below 100pc last year to around 94.5pc, it said. Even left-wing republican party Sinn Féin is relatively conservative on economic matters - it is pro-EU and recognises the importance of maintaining the country's controversial 12.5pc corporate tax rate..Therefore, it is no great surprise that market reaction to the result has been muted."
"The exit from the euro ""is no longer a priority""As for the exit from the euro, This year, Marine Le Pen's argument is that the sovereignist camp will be able to change things at the European level after the vote on 26 May. Nothing is less certain. If the RN can hope to win more than twenty seats in the European Parliament, it is not the same for all its friendly parties. Especially since the battalion of elected members of Ukip, the British Eurosceptic party, will not be re-elected because of Brexit."
"The fact that there are fundamental differences of opinion on EU issues is to be turned to the advantage of both parties in the election campaign: The ÖVP would have a big mobilisation problem anyway. If it consciously positions itself against the FPÖ on this issue, it will at least have an issue in the EU election campaign that interests its own people, especially those who are sceptical of the FPÖ. And the FPÖ is also using the fool's freedom on this issue to strike oppositional tones and present its electorate with what they expect."
"The far right can help strengthen Thulesen Dahl's prime ministerial ambitions, whether they get into parliament or not. THE MOST DANGEROUS BANDARD for this plan is Thulesen Dahl's broken promise on the EU referendum.It is in the Danish People's Party's embarrassment to vote against, and it was difficult for Thulesen Dahl to admit that during the election campaign leading up to the referendum on the opt-in system in the legal field he said he would vote in favour if Denmark does not get a parallel agreement.-- but it would have been even harder for him to vote yes."
"The government has won the support of the Left and the Conservatives on the issue of the financial pact, and there is thus a majority in Parliament in favour of a Danish yes. At the same time, the EU's new possibilities to control the economy of each member state have prompted the Liberal Alliance, the Danish People's Party and the Greens to call for a referendum. MEASUREMENT A large majority is in favour of the EU countries' financial pact."
"The growing Euroscepticism among the Conservatives follows the breakthrough of the UK Independence Party earlier this month in regional elections. The party, led by flamboyant MEP Nigel Farage, garnered nearly a quarter of the vote. UKIP is a PVV-like party founded in 1993 in protest against the Maastricht Treaty and wants the UK to leave the EU.Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Cameron promised earlier this year to negotiate with Brussels for a looser relationship with the EU."
"The highlight was a citizens' forum on ORF with appearances by politicians, lobbyists, but also doubting citizens. Even a prominent anti-EU swearer, the FPÖ leader Jörg Haider, was given the opportunity to make an immortal fool of himself with his warnings that the people's body would be poisoned with tortoise louse yoghurt and blood chocolate. However, the Greens were also opposed to accession at the time."
"The historically far-reaching asylum restrictions will be adopted in parliament anyway. The Social Democrats, the Danish People's Party and the Liberals have their sights set on the common electorate of EU-sceptic and anti-immigrant Danes, which for the same reason is the most significant for Danish politics.The interlocking SOV trio continues."
"The increasingly confident populists across Europe are giving an outlet to this basic grumbling. Whether it is the Front National in France, Ukip in the UK or the Alternative for Germany (AfD), together these Eurosceptic voices swell into a chorus that drowns out the silence of the silent pro-European majority. This development has been looming for a long time, but with the increasing electoral successes of the right-wing populists, it is slowly becoming dangerous for the very survival of the peace project."
"The junior minister repeated his praise for the party on radio yesterday, hours after being slapped down by the Taoiseach's spokesman, who sternly declared it was 'not an appropriate thing to say'. And the tensions between him and his party leader looked set to grow after Mr Varadkar lashed out at Sinn Féin, calling it a sectarian and anti-EU party.Mr Daly, who is Junior Minister for Mental Health and Older People, told Today With Seán O'Rourke on RTÉ Radio 1 that he would object to Sinn Féin policy."
"The leader of the FN, who has committed her party to a new strategy of alliances, wanted to achieve the highest possible score in France with a list open to all national-sovereignist currents. In Europe, she also expressed the wish to build alliances with other European movements, notably within the Europe of Nations and Liberties group, ENL, in the European Parliament, to which the FN belongs, and beyond.We thought that we could only change Europe through the Elysium."
"The leading candidate of the European People's Party (EPP) for the European elections, Manfred Weber, has sparked a heated debate with his call to cut funding from the European Union (EU) budget for anti-European parties like the AfD. On Tuesday, Weber told the WELT that European parties whose aim is to destroy the European Union, such as the right-wing radicals of Le Pen or large parts of the AfD, should no longer receive money from European funds. The politician from Lower Bavaria gave as his reason: There is no institution in the world that is so naive as to finance its own opponents. These anti-European parties use taxpayers' EU money to pay for election campaigns, campaigns and posters whose aim is to abolish the EU. But can Weber's demand be legally implemented at all? The demand violates the principle of equality, says Professor Martin Morlok, a Europe-wide renowned expert on international party law at the University of Düsseldorf."
"The lesson should also be used among us to disqualify populism, which in this sense has nothing to do with the post-Gramscian pyrotechnics of Laclau and Errejón, but with those programs and policies that are based on the gap between an offer of a substantial increase in the resources available to the social majority and the limitations imposed by sustainable economic growth. The fight against inequality is a requirement, especially among us after what has happened; another thing is to return, as in the Podemos schemes, to the old and effective demagogy of seeing wealth as the only enemy and the European Union or the ECB as obstacles to be demolished. Since the failure of Fidel's utopia, the idea of the turn of the tortilla as a solution should be definitively banished by progressive ideologies."
"The major question, however, is that of ideological direction: once an ardent supporter of a Frexit and an exit from the euro, Marine Le Pen has backed down, explaining last week to Valeurs Actuelles that in many areas, we can improve the daily life of the French without leaving Europe or the euro. It is a major doctrinal evolution on which she should be asked to explain herself on Thursday evening because, as a FN parliamentary source said, echoing Florian Philippot's recent criticisms, if we abandon the exit from the EU and the euro, I don't see how we can recover sovereignty. There is a practical inconsistency."
"The moment of great clarification Yes, my friends, we are going to come to power,"" said campaign director Steeve Briois in front of Front Party activists, showing that for the far-right party, the challenge is to see further than this simple European election. Marine Le Pen has therefore gathered her troops, her elected representatives and the first 12 members of the RN list for the European elections to begin a long campaign that will last until May.If Marine Le Pen does call for a dissolution of the National Assembly and new legislative elections, she knows that her wish has little chance of being granted."
"The mood for new special deals is not helped by the fact that Denmark would have to ask for a deal at the same time as Britain is in full swing next year to demand a rollback of British EU membership. It's a dangerous time for Denmark to come and ask for an opt-out for Europol, when you can just use the opt-in in the Treaty that you asked for, says researcher Camino Mortera-Martinez, an expert in EU legal policy at the Centre for European Reform in London.The Danish People's Party will cast doubt on the government's promises ahead of the referendum.-- But the DF's own promise of a special deal if the Danes vote no is on thin ice."
"The most obvious thing to do is to use the infrastructure that already exists, he says. The Danish People's Party has criticized the EU for wanting to punish Britain for Brexit for tactical reasons, but the party's EU spokesman, Kenneth Kristensen, Berth will not agree to offer the British EU citizenship. It's probably fine for the British, but is it also appropriate for Denmark? What are the consequences? If at some point you see that Poland leaves the EU, then we should offer Poland the same."
"The new Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage knows the Sinn Féin leader personally from their time together in the European Parliament and the two shared a platform together to fight Micheál Martin during the Fiscal Compact Treaty referendum in 2012, Mr Smith said. Sinn Féin's record on the European Union is clear, unambiguous and hiding in plain sight. Every time the Irish people were asked to vote on a European referendum, Sinn Féin told them to vote against."
"The new cast may make the Greens the stalwart of the balance. And the ecologists do not hide the fact that they will lean towards progressive and pro-European positions to counteract the announced Trumpian offensive promoted from Italy by Salvini, with his allies in France (Marine Le Pen), Poland (Jaroslaw Kaczynski), Hungary (Viktor Orbán) or, in Spain with the emergence of Vox.Obstacles"
"The other bourgeois parties talk about zero or negative growth. The EU also divides the parties in the blue bloc. The Danish People's Party wants to keep the Danish reservations and have it put to a referendum if treaty changes are to be made or new member states admitted.The Danish People's Party also foresees problems in meeting their demands for integration policy, although Thulesen Dahl sees positive signs in recent announcements from the Left to opt out of some immigrants and in for others."
"The other day it appeared in Politiken that the boat trip was financed by the European Parliament through funds for a political alliance of EU-sceptic parties, to which the Danish People's Party is affiliated. EU FUNDS You can't campaign nationally with EU funds, but the Danish People's Party's sailing trips in the run-up to the 2013 local elections were funded by money from the European Parliament. Morten Messerschmidt rejects criticism: 'It can't get any more EU-like'."
"The other way would be for Austria, out of consideration for the EU-scepticism of the Freedom Party, which still goes back to Jörg Haider, to take a European policy turn, to move in the direction of the neo-sceptics in Eastern Europe. The FPÖ flirted with this during the election campaign although it was recently said that the Freedom Party would fall over on the EU-Canada free trade agreement Ceta and would vote for it in full in the National Council. And Kurz wants to take the EU agenda to the Chancellery."
"The party had hired the over 100 year old schooner 'Halmø' to ferry chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl, MEP Morten Messerschmidt and other leading DF members around to 16 Danish port cities. The other day it appeared in Politiken that the boat trip was financed by the European Parliament through funds for a political alliance of EU-sceptic parties, to which the Danish People's Party is affiliated. EU FUNDS You can't campaign nationally with EU funds, but the Danish People's Party's sailing trips in the run-up to the 2013 local elections were funded by money from the European Parliament."
"The party is pursuing European policy against its better judgement. The risk is further EU distraction and discomfort. The result is predictable: a thunderous victory for the DF in the EU parliamentary elections and a no vote in the same day's referendum on the patent court.Not because a majority of Danes are against an EU patent, but because they are sick and tired of the EU - a tiredness that is fed by the Left's campaign."
"The party leaders claimed the UK government was not paying heed to the majority view, and instead indulging its Brexiteer confidence and supply partners at Westminster, the DUP. Sinn Féin vice-president and Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said the EU negotiators needed to hear loud and clear that people in the North wanted to remain within European structures.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood claimed elements of the DUP were also warming to the idea of continued alignment with the EU in terms of customs and single market rules."
"The party's member of the European Parliament, Morten Messerschmidt, admits. In 2006, he himself was EU spokesman when the Danish People's Party voted to change the European patent system. With the simultaneous surrender of Danish sovereignty."
"The point is that the Danish People's Party is quietly and gradually changing its strategy. In February, the DF's Morten Messerschmidt was still hoping for a British yes. As late as 9 June, EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth replied that a referendum was not on the cards at the moment.Still not, but now DF is trying to make a possible 'Daxit' stand and blink for years to come."
"The point is that without the DF it looks difficult for the jasid. The handsy Japanese no longer have much faith that they can get the Danes to vote yes to anything to do with the EU without the DF's involvement.It is unclear whether they will even dare to call a referendum, and it is uncertain whether they will be able to win it."
"The portent of a massive anti-EU movement following a possible electoral success of the AfD in Germany does not loom in any case. This would require a surprise alliance of Le Pen, Orbán, Strache and the AfD in the new European Parliament. In fact, the patriotic allies do not seem to have noticed that Salvini has made his career not as a nationalist but as a splittist."
"The positive thing about the agreement is that Denmark will in some areas get better conditions than countries like Columbia, Norway and the United States. However, this is solely due to the fact that Denmark is a member of the EU and Schengen. Two areas that the Danish People's Party is either very critical of or directly opposed to. Should Denmark - as the Danish People's Party wants - leave Schengen, the agreement on Europol would immediately cease."
"The possibility of a group The European Parliament elected in 2009 has just over 10% of committed Eurosceptics, of which one third are on the left of the left (European United Left group) and two thirds on the right of the right (Europe Liberté and Non-attached groups, including the FN). Together with the new opposition parties, they could capture 20% of the hemicycle, according to the latest estimates (around 150 seats out of 751)."
"The pro-EU parties in Parliament are in the process of defining exactly what the vote after the upcoming general election should be about. And the sceptics in the Danish People's Party in particular are formulating a campaign that this time will have to be much more nuanced than anything we have seen from their side on EU issues in the past. EUROPEAN ANALYSIS The Danish People's Party will have to take a much more nuanced approach to the EU in the referendum on the legal reservation.The big challenge for DF is that the government together with SF, Venstre and Conservatives will do everything to make the vote about Denmark's security."
"The problem is that Eurosceptics come in all flavours. It was around the British Ukip that a group quickly crystallised, with the support of a National Front MP who had broken with her party. Joëlle Bergeron, elected in the Grand Ouest region, distanced herself from her party after she said she was in favour of the right of foreigners to vote in local elections."
"The process of fleshing out the principles in the document will begin in Brussels next week, with meetings among senior officials beginning on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has reiterated its call for a special designated status within the EU for Northern Ireland. The party also called for a referendum on Irish unity."
"The purchase of fighter aircraft will also be decided in the new year. EU/UK DF wants a more EU critical line.. The debate is being fuelled by Britain's desire for a new deal on its relationship with the EU, which may be put to a vote as early as this year."
"The question is also how interested the Danish People's Party would really be in packing away their criticism of EU policy with a compromise. The party previously wanted a withdrawal from the EU. In recent years, the DF has formally supported EU membership, but makes a political living by criticising the Union. Will Kristian Thulesen Dahl take responsibility for an EU policy that does not closely match the Danish People's Party's own?"
"The right-wing coalition came out on top with 37% of the vote, according to results from almost all polling stations. But within it, it is the League, Matteo Salvini's Eurosceptic and anti-immigration formation, close to the French National Front (FN), which has largely overtaken Silvio Berlusconi's party (17.4% against 14%) and now claims the leadership of the government.Elections in Italy: the return of the monsters"

The right-wing nationalist to extreme right-wing prominence in the EU spoke out in a joint declaration at the weekend. Right in the middle: the FPÖ. DER STANDARD spoke with its EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky about his foreign policy plans and the current conflicts within the EU.STANDARD:
The risk of the billion-dollar penalties provided for by the infringement procedure appears unlikely because there is the precedent of when the Eurogroup-Ecofin set them at zero for Spain and Portugal condemned for excessive deficit. Unpredictable remains the possibility of a political use of the clash between Brussels and the sovereignist/populist M5S-Lega government.© RESTRICTED REPRODUCTION0
The same rural and deprived working-class areas that voted No in large numbers in a succession of European referendums voted No again this time on a very different type of constitutional amendment. The rejection of the fiscal treaty last June by the two Donegal constituencies was perceived as a manifestation of support for the Sinn Féin anti-EU position. But the same two constituencies voted No again this time by a very similar margin despite the fact that Sinn Féin had signed up to the Yes campaign.
"The situation is different with DF chairman Kristian Thulesen Dahl, with whom Løkke Rasmussen has routinely argued about the EU for years. In the longer term, it could easily complicate matters that Thulesen used his referendum speech last week to declare his readiness to take the plunge into a new government and at the same time announce a desire for a Danish referendum in the event of a Brexit.The Danish People's Party wants to be an equal partner in any future round of government negotiations with the Left. But the wish for a referendum is certainly not the wish of the Left."
"The spectacular advance of the Danish People's Party is a signal that although support for the EU is strong among the majority of Danes, it does not come of its own accord - and work must be done to maintain it. The DF has conducted an election campaign with an appealing, but meaningless message: less EU, more Denmark.Morten Messerschmidt has built his campaign on the illusion that Denmark can retain the benefits of the EU without entering fully into the cooperation."
"The stabilization (possibly even shrinkage) of the anti-European bloc in the Netherlands is striking. Whereas PVV and SP accounted for 6 seats (out of 26) in 2014, the exit poll now predicts 5 for Forum, PVV and SP combined. In the estimate of GeenPeil, which processed the results in 700 polling stations, PVV and SP lose all the seats, which would bring the anti-EU bloc to a meager 3 seats. 3 Higher voter turnout?"
"The statement, which Politiken has in its possession, states that the organisation of Danish welfare services is a national competence and foreigners should come to Denmark because they want to contribute to Danish society and not to gain access to social benefits. The VK also directly criticises the government: The Folketing shares the German Chancellor's view that the EU is not a social union, and criticises the fact that the government has so far not been willing to seek alliance partners in the EU who share this view.--Both the DF and the Liberal Alliance are seeking a further tightening, so that the government is instructed to go directly on the offensive against the EU. It is clear that there are divisions on EU policy."
"The target of his criticism is DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl, who has said that Britain can probably negotiate a new deal with the EU even if the British vote on 23 June to leave the union. In April, Thulesen Dahl said that the most likely scenario after a British no vote is a new form of intermediate link to the EU, in which case the DF believes Denmark should seek a similar deal.-- But it's a misunderstanding, says Farage: If a British politician suggested it, I'd suggest we reopen the Tower of London and throw that robber in jail! No is no, and no means out of the EU."
"The threat of destruction hangs over both Poland and the EU, and the European Parliament elections in Poland will decide to what extent it will come true. According to forecasts, anti-European forces, such as the Law and Justice party or Le Pen in France or Salvini in Italy, may gain 25-30 percent. EP seats."
"The three of them kept opening new barrels: Meuthen expressed reservations about Weidel's aspirations to chair the parliamentary group, Weidel doubted Meuthen's suitability as party leader. They argued about the demand in the election manifesto for Germany to leave the EU as well as about whether the AfD is strong because of its successes in southern eastern Germany or weak because of its other failures.#NAME?"
"The topic of Europe was quickly turned into a job interview by Kurz. The ÖVP hopeful gave the FPÖ candidate mixed feedback. When Austria takes over the EU Presidency in 2018, it is not enough to be critical of Europe, you have to play a positive role. And the current cooperation of the Freedom Party with the German right-wing AfD or the right-wing populist Front National of Marie Le Pen at the European level is an obstacle to this. In short: Mr Strache, you have developed in many areas."
"The transformation of Norbert Steger also fits into the picture. The former parade liberal, who left the party in 1993 because of the FPÖ's anti-EU stance, rejoined under Heinz-Christian Strache and has since supported his policies - currently as an extended arm on the ORF supervisory board. In the meantime, he is speaking out there in the sense of his community of thought without regard for losses."
"The truly Europe-critical parties have in common that they believe European cooperation has already gone far too far. The PVV goes furthest in this: this party wants the Netherlands to leave the European Union as soon as possible and also to say goodbye to the euro.The SP accepts the European Union as a given, but wants to drastically limit integration."
"The two nationalist and identitarian tenors intend to weld together the alliance of twelve parties, all of which agree to fight immigration and Islamisation but are divided on budgetary discipline, the distribution of migrants entering the EU, and Russia. Their aim is to make the Europe of Nations and Liberties group (ENL), where the League, the RN, the FPÖ or the Flemish Vlaams Belang already sit, the third force in the European Parliament, a place also coveted by the ALDE liberals, where the French elected representatives, lined up behind President Emmanuel Macron, could sit.Take back the keys Matteo Salvini, who is also Italy's deputy prime minister and interior minister, has been stepping up election meetings, calling Friday for a hand in becoming the leading party in Europe, to take back the keys to our house."
"The two parties will trigger a referendum on the pan-European patent court, which the Danish EU Presidency is working hard to reach agreement on at the EU summit on Thursday and Friday. Just as the Prime Minister has cancelled EU referenda, the EL and DF want to force a referendum.A Danish agreement to the patent court requires a majority of five sixths of the seats in Parliament or a yes vote in a referendum, because it is a question of surrendering sovereignty."
"The victories achieved by the populists in the years that followed were thus more the result of the weakness of the traditional parties, which had become lost in political struggle, than any merit of their own. In any case, SP and PVV have not succeeded in giving their skepticism or hostility to the EU any lasting recruiting power. The latest election results have shown that among the Dutch electorate, realism has prevailed over emotion."
"The voice of the minority has become the standard-bearer of the majority. The party that gets its fix from always being against has crossed the finish line: the Danish People's Party largely defines the political battleground of the day: against more EU, against the 'elite', against foreigners. POLITICS MEANS Let Denmark move on, Thulesen Dahl."
"The votes covered motions on securing a special status for the North post-Brexit and on the North-South electricity interconnector. The Coalition lost in three votes on its approach to Brexit.It lost the votes on a Private Members' motion submitted by Sinn Féin, which called for the Government to negotiate for the North to retain a special status within the EU when Britain leaves the bloc.The Sinn Féin motion also called for quarterly reports to the Dáil by the Government on Brexit negotiations and for all of Ireland to remain within the EU after Brexit."
"The wife of the detained leader of the Greek neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, went to Moscow in May to visit Kremlin ideologue Aleksandr Doegin. The party, which scored 9 percent in the EU elections, supports Putin against the Americans. PVVBefore the MH17 disaster, the PVV favored Russia - Geert Wilders tried to prevent his group members from being critical of Russia, De Telegraaf wrote in June."
The word This is the political position of those who argue that a country must defend national sovereignty in areas that by international treaties or policies are delegated to supranational entities such as the EU. The League and FdI are part of this political environment.0
The word This is the political position of those who argue that a country must defend or regain national sovereignty in areas that for treaties or international policies are instead delegated to supranational entities such as the EU. Salvini's League and Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia are protagonists of this in Italy.0
"The worst beggars would be in the executive suites of the banks. Strache invited In the following years, the FPÖ campaigned against banks and speculators as well as an EU of corporations and in favour of making millionaires and banks pay. After several pirouettes, the party finally distanced itself from the wealth tax."
"The young candidate, aged 23, says that his modest origins and the fact that he grew up in Seine-Saint-Denis give him a closeness to the terrain and also to many of the demands of the ""yellow waistcoats"", who are protesting against the government's social and fiscal policy. Considering that today it is (Emmanuel) Macron who is totally isolated on the European scene and no longer the RN, he pleads for a coalition of sovereignist parties to rebuild a different European Union, threatening to leave the euro if we don't succeed.Yes, if at some point we don't succeed, we will draw conclusions."
"The zones were supposed to be phased out over time. But the European Commission has just approved the Polish zones until 2020. The zones should instead be abolished, says Danish People's Party MEP Morten Messerschmidt: I think it's an injustice that there are these zones. I thought the whole idea of the EU was that there should be equal competition between countries."
"The ÖVP insists on at least ten percent approval before referendums are to be initiated. Former Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek, meanwhile also a sympathiser of the Neos and once chairman of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) when Austria voted with 66 per cent in favour of EU accession in 1994, qualifies the most recent statements in the FPÖ as playing with fire ... Basically, it is not a discussion about democracy that is needed, but about how it is currently presented, sometimes discrediting the participatory elements.And Busek also recalls that British Prime Minister David Cameron initiated a referendum on leaving the EU in order to finally get rid of the problem of EU scepticism, fuelled by Brexit supporter Nigel Farage.That is why the ÖVP and the Neos should also ask themselves what the intention behind the current blue demands is, because: Nothing happens without a reason."
"Then 65 percent said that they believe that Austria will continue to exist in the same or a similar way in 100 years 22 percent explicitly do not believe this. It tends to be older respondents, declared pessimists and supporters of the FPÖ who give an unfavourable prognosis for Austria's continued existence in its present form.EU scepticismThe further question of whether the European Union will still exist in 100 years is even answered in the negative by 45 per cent (again to a particularly high degree by FPÖ voters) and in the affirmative by only 38 per cent."
There are a number of EU issues on which the Japanese have given up trying to agree. EU POLICY The agreement to put the legal reservation to a referendum also opens up the possibility for the Danish People's Party to get involved in EU policy for the first time. The attempt to make a grand European political deal that addressed many different EU issues has been abandoned by the government.
"There are more things that bind the anti-Europeans than separate them. Sure, the Front National has an anti-Semitic tradition, while Wilders' PVV is unilaterally pro-Israel. But when it comes to migration, asylum issues, keeping Turkey out of the EU, less power to Brussels and an even smaller European budget, these and other anti-parties are on the same page. This is a good basis for a group."
"There is a real danger here for the AfD, as was shown at the end of June after the British Brexit referendum. While the AfD gave a friendly to euphoric welcome to the British exit from the EU, the Germans, fearing for the good European order, rejected Brexit by a large majority in polls, leaving the AfD pretty much alone with its criticism of the EU. There seems to be a difference for the Germans between theoretically questioning the order in phases of stability - and smashing it when the order is actually threatened."
"There is nothing to expose. That the FPÖ ultimately wants to destroy the EU is as well known as the Nazi problem with which it is afflicted. Armin Wolf chose the latter, and he was right."
"There is therefore a fear in the Law and Justice camp that no matter what the ruling camp does or doesn't do, it will still get no or very little money from the Reconstruction Funds. Because - in the opinion of Law and Justice politicians - EU member states, in agreement with Donald Tusk, have come to the conclusion that nothing should be given to the Law and Justice team, since this financial support will enable the party to win another election in 2023 and continue to destroy the EU from within. It's like feeding the enemy to your own destruction."
"There were differences in pace. Between the inauguration and the government's declaration in parliament, ÖVP leader Kurz rushed to Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker to allay concerns about the EU-sceptical FPÖ. The latter confirmed a pro-European tone to his programme, but emphasised distance from the FPÖ."
"There will be no polexit, it is a propaganda invention, Jaroslaw Kaczynski assured in an interview with PAP. He made it clear that no one in the Law and Justice party is planning Poland's exit from the EU. But there could also be a chain of events leading to such a decision, especially since, according to Ludwik Dorn, who is currently on the opposition's side, Kaczynski's room for maneuver is shrinking."
"These words, however, were considered unacceptable by Salvini, who asked Di Maio for free hands for the League on immigration: From Europe comes yet another unacceptable interference of the unelected. We have welcomed and maintained too much, now is the time of legality, security and rejections, said the secretary of the League. Instead, Di Maio chose a generic formula to reply to Brussels: The more Eurocrats attack us, the more they motivate us. But Senator Paola Nugnes reiterated the point of view of the grillini on immigration: The M5S does not have any intention to deny rights and hospitality to those who are foreigners as such..."

"They spoke out after the Taoiseach welcomed comments by Mary Lou McDonald, that her party could go into government as a junior partner. While the Taoiseach criticised Sinn Féin's attitude to EU issues, he added: 'I said I wouldn't do business with Fianna Fáil either, so depending on the result the electorate gives you, politicians have to work with the result. So Sinn Féin seem to be converted now to a position of changing their stance.' Asked about a possible Sinn Féin role after the next election, Mr Kenny did not answer the question and instead responded that Fine Gael would have a 'much stronger result'."
"They would like to cooperate with the British Ukip, but it keeps its distance. Hungarian Jobbik ruled out Le Pen for a possible group in the EU Parliament. Front National and FPÖ are in the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF), MEP Le Pen is vice-president, Obermayr the president."
"This begins with the obviously ineradicable anti-Semitism that repeatedly causes the party distress through the actions of individuals. This is very clear in the criticism of the EU and is also revealed in the uncertain handling of phenomena such as Pegida and the AfD. Right-wingers and parts of the left are also united in their contempt for the political system, the ruling politicians and their supposed vassals in the media: for some it is the lying press, for others the bourgeois press controlled by secret services."
"This call to Sarkozy is a way of underlining that the party has still not found a clear line on the essential issues. ""It will be like that until the primaries"", resigned Baroin, while considering it necessary for the former president to restore coherence to the tug-of-war on Europe, which is the great bone of contention with the National Front, whose anti-European positions tend to bite on the UMP line. In passing, Baroin did not hide his antipathy towards Jean-François Copé, to whom some would like to attribute the UMP's success in the last municipal elections."
"This challenges both the Social Democrats and the Left. S has already raised the critical tone by several decibels, and at the People's Meeting, President Frederiksen sided with the DF, against the EU, signalling another step away from the otherwise entrenched yes-party cooperation. Unlike the Left, which is again EU-friendly, albeit with internal and significant disagreements."
"This debunks the accusation that politicians do not listen to citizens. What about the citizens who don't listen to the politicians? For example, if Norbert Hofer had won the first round of the federal presidential election this year, would citizens have really listened to him when he talked about promptly dismissing the government? Would they have listened to the FPÖ when it propagated leaving the EU earlier?It may well be that many politicians do not really understand the real fears and concerns of many citizens, but listening to them is media and oppositional humbug with the greatest potential for manipulation."
"This disenchantment has found its outlet in the ballot box, with the electoral scores of the so-called ""populist"" and ""eurosceptic"" parties soaring. The Brexit is likely to uninhibit them everywhere, in both old and new EU members. In France, the FN is calling for a vote to leave the EU (see page 6), and this seems to be spreading across the political spectrum, with Bruno Le Maire on the right also calling for a popular consultation on the European question. In Italy, Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement, buoyed by its breakthrough in the last municipal elections, wants a referendum on the euro."
"This is a success for Marine Le Pen, who leads the French election with 23.2%. But in the end, the far-right party remains stable compared to the 2014 European elections. At that time, the FN was already the big winner with 24.9% of the vote.This is a slight increase of 1.4 percentage points to 14.3%."
"This is anything but an unknown: the European elections are an outpouring of discontent, all the more so at the end of a long crisis. Alongside well-known entities such as the French National Front and the British Ukip, two dozen sovereignist, anti-liberal, nationalist or Europhobic formations are in the running this year. A third of these protest parties have never had a single seat in the Parliament, or even campaigned at the European level."
"This is part of the manipulation and lying propaganda. PiS believes Poland's place is in the EU- said Morawiecki. - It is also worth emphasizing that we are a sovereign state, we do not act under the dictates of Brussels or any other capital."
"This is the political position that advocates the defense or reconquest of national sovereignty by a people or a state, in antithesis to the dynamics of globalization and in opposition to supranational policies of concertation. This philosophy is espoused by parties on the European continent that contest the devolution of broad powers to the European Union. Among these are the League and Fratelli d'Italia and the political formations of Mateusz Morawiecki in Poland and Viktor Orbán in Hungary.0"
"This is the result of an analysis of hundreds of laws by the think tank Europa. The proportion of times the Danish People's Party votes in favour on EU issues is broadly in line with the classic pro-EU parties.The Danish People's Party can almost be called a secret yes party, says Nadja Schou Lauridsen, a lawyer at the think tank Europa."
"This is, in short, the message of the Council of State to Dutch politicians in the report Monetary union published Wednesday There is no shortage of 'visions' of the euro, only: politicians don't like them that much. This motion, by MP Pieter Omtzigt (CDA), was again a response to the citizens' initiative Peuro by, among others, the anti-EU activist and current MP Thierry Baudet (Forum voor Democratie). Baudet et al."
"This party is announced in some polls as the winner of the European elections on 26 May, as it was in May 2014. But it is mostly unknown how these elected representatives who dream of transforming the current Union into an alliance of nations from within vote. In Brussels and Strasbourg, the RN MEPs are clearly part of the refusal front. In recent months, they have rejected, among other things, the Sargentini report, which denounced the Orban government's anti-democratic excesses, the resolution recognising Juan Guaido as the legitimate president in place of Maduro in Venezuela, CO2 quotas in industry and the report banning electric fishing."
"This silence or murmuring silent phrases are, the prime minister said, a very unreadable alternative to what Law and Justice politicians proclaim clearly. And he read from a prepared sheet of paper the statements of PiS parliamentarians from 2012 and 2013, such as: We have to consider leaving the EU, The sense of staying in the EU is clearly fading, I don't accept our membership of the EU at all, which President Kaczynski knows about and has approved, I am waiting and praying that it will just fall apart on its own, because I am fundamentally against the EU, The constant display of our flag with some EU rag insults our symbols.- All politicians and political groups that are weakening the integrated European Union in Poland and Europe today, that want to make breaches in the EU, that practice some kind of phantasmagoria that if the EU splits a little, there will be more sovereignty, are in fact objectively or subjectively playing the role of politicians supporting Putin in his very dangerous game, Tusk emphasized."
"This strategy of dramatisation is very risky and worries even the majority. While they are not unaware of the symbolic significance of a victory, however short, of the far right in France, some regret that the issue at stake in the European Parliament has been passed over in silence: to federate around the Renaissance elected representatives a ""central group"", the pivot of a majority committed to the ""refoundation"" of the EU. ""It's a good thing that we're one point ahead or one point behind the RN, but this objective is still within reach,"" said former Green MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit. The Loiseau campaign's strategists dismissed this argument: even for this intermediate election, which was by nature unfavourable to the majority in power, it was, they explained, ""impossible to show anything other than the objective of finishing first""."
"This will certainly not be an easy assignment to fulfil but it is one which every Irish nationalist political party on the island should now regard as a priority. Sinn Féin, in particular, must discard its traditional ambivalence towards the EU and also stop talking about border polls and reunification.It must for once take into account the interests of all the people of this island and persuade enough Northern Protestants that remaining within the EU will not undermine their long-held traditions and beliefs."
"This, however, cannot be told to ordinary voters. Because then how will they explain the several years of yammering on the EU? The nationalists of the Law and Justice party cannot be told this either, because they will not threaten PiS in the autumn. Since almost no one in the Law and Justice party says what they think about European issues, there remain various poses to suit the current state of the election campaign.Now Law and Justice wants to take some of the centrist voters away from the European Coalition and not frighten most of their own voters who, it turns out, are still in favour of the EU. So PiS pretends to be more pro-European than Juncker and Timmermans put together for the sake of its own backyard."
"Those who are demonstrating today in the streets of Venezuela are not Europeans, but they fight for the same values for which we fight, Spanish centre-right EU lawmaker Esteban Gonzalez Pons said in a statement. As Venezuela has sunk into economic and political crisis that has brought mass emigration and hyperinflation, the EU imposed an arms embargo Comment Sinn Féin yet again on wrong side of history 21 and sanctions on officials to decry what it views as rights violations and the rupture of democracy.Detained Yesterday, the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists said seven foreign journalists were detained in Venezuela, including French and Spanish reporters."
"Thulesen Dahl is happy to buy into the rhetoric and believes that Denmark should be in the EU, but choose the small model. Time has run out for full-throated sceptics or EU advocates, he says.In the left, the development in the DF's rhetoric is being carefully noted and no doubt interpreted as a move towards government participation.Therefore, the Left has now invented another argument against DF'ere in ministerial cars: tax policy."
"Timo Soini of the Finns sees that Cameron has already opened the bottle cap. Once the genie in the bottle is out of the bottle, Soini hopes that Finland will follow Britain's lead and hold a referendum on EU membership in 2015.Antola believes that Cameron has been interpreted one-sidedly."
"To ban the sale and purchase of almost all semi-automatic long guns throughout the EU because of this, the Viennese salesman qualifies as a similar grotesque as the European Central Bank's plan to abolish the 500-euro note, also in order to mess up terrorists' multi-million dollar businesses. Harald Vilimsky, MEP of the FPÖ, who is not in the business but is the proud owner of two handguns and one long gun, which he does not want to specify. It's not as if the sport shooters, who are always strictly controlled by the executive, run into the stadiums to do some damage, says Vilimsky."
To put an end to the export of family benefits; to deport immediately in cases of asylum abuse. EU The Blue Party wants to stop payments to EU bankrupt states.The FPÖ is throwing between five and six million into the battle the party spends almost a third of this on posters. 20 per cent of the costs are spent on events and folders.
"Today, Kaczynski's Poland and Orbán's Hungary find themselves perhaps a bit disoriented. Trump was not re-elected, Biden is a supporter of European integration, the EU has been strengthened, the two Italian parties most friendly to Orbán and Kaczynski are both in opposition (Lega and Fratelli d'Italia, the latter, however, less viscerally opposed to the EU and more selective in its criticism); Putin's Russia seems close to a delicate succession phase.In short, there are no geopolitical reasons that should induce the EU to bow its head before the autocratic rulers of Budapest and Warsaw at a time when they challenge, moreover from positions of weakness, the moral and legal principles on which our and, we would like, their Europe rests."
"Top of the list of casualties will be Northern Ireland farmers, chief among them Arlene Foster's agricultural-centred constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Sinn Féin's alignment to official EU policy on Brexit represents a step away from the Eurosceptic bent it is on record as having. It voted against the Nice and Lisbon treaties, and more recently the Fiscal Compact treaties."
"Turn on the projectors The FN leader then focused on the European budgetary treaty, which for her is synonymous with ""hyper-austerity"" and the loss of ""budgetary sovereignty"". And to plead for a referendum on the issue."
"Tusk as prime minister has done little to put Poland on a clear path to the eurozone, while Szydlo comes from a camp very reluctant to the single currency. Despite sharp political differences, at least they may now collectively fear that the lack of the euro will only exacerbate Poland's marginalization (caused mainly by PiS's conflicts with the rest of the EU) in debates about future EU reforms.Macron proposed at the Sorbonne to set up, already in the coming weeks, a &bdquo;group for the reconstruction of the Union for representatives of willing EU countries."
"Tusk put everything on the line. His main idea to come back to power is to accuse PiS that it is pushing for post-lexit. And either Poland's relations with the EU in the coming months will confirm this thesis, i.e. we will not get the money, or we will get it and then the whole ruling camp will be on top. Let me remind you that recently, however, PiS has backed down."
"Two years ago, Brussels would probably have gone along with him - but after two years of unsuccessful mediation, propaganda attacks, the replacement of the ambassador to the EU twice, and above all in view of the scale of violations of the rule of law, Poland today does not have in Brussels the clout it once had. The hard stance of the European Commission will mean that the application of Article 7 will drag on for many months and will hang over Poland, seriously weakening Warsaw's position in the negotiations of the next EU budget, which will start later this year.. judicial reforms."
"UUP leader Robin Swann said it was a sovereignty issue and his party can't see how that situation can come about. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was pleased the European Parliament official was on board with the idea of the North staying in the customs union and single market and that he had agreed it was madness there is no devolved government in place at present to make strong representation on Brexit. Sinn Féin northern leader Michelle O'Neill accused the British government of viewing Ireland as collateral damage in their reckless Brexit agenda.Today's meeting was part of that ongoing process to press the case for the North to be granted special status to remain in the EU because that is the only credible way to prevent the catastrophe that Brexit will visit upon Ireland, she said."
"Ulla Tørnæs maintains that she fundamentally supports freedom of movement. But the rise of Eurosceptic parties like the Danish People's Party in Denmark, the Front National in France and Britain's Ukip this spring has made an impression. We have to take it seriously when Danes and millions of Europeans around the world have expressed their concern with their votes, says Ulla Tørnæs."
"Unity and differences on Western Balkans. On another EU Presidency topic, the EU's rapprochement with the Western Balkans, there is only one common ground: the ÖVP and the FPÖ are in favour of Serbia's EU accession. The foreign minister nominated by the FPÖ is also committed to the rest of the Western Balkans, not so some FPÖ politicians."
"Unity and differences on Western Balkans. On another EU Presidency topic, the EU's rapprochement with the Western Balkans, there is only one thing in common: the ÖVP and FPÖ are in favour of Serbia joining the EU. The foreign minister nominated by the FPÖ is also in favour of the remaining Western Balkan countries, not so some FPÖ politicians. Strache criticises the state recognition of Kosovo."
"Unlike most left-wing parties in Europe - from Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain to Die Linke in Germany - Enhedslisten recommends a British exit - without making a fuss about it. The alliance with the Danish People's Party is powerful, but also unwieldy.If the British vote 'remain' - i.e. stay in the EU - the political consequences in Denmark will be more manageable. Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (V) will declare himself relieved, but also use the great scepticism to raise a warning finger at Brussels."
"Vienna On the sidelines of the two-day meeting of European interior ministers in Vienna, Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) reiterated at the start on Thursday that he would not comply with the EU's insistence on an end to border controls. Austria will maintain its controls until there is a functioning EU external border protection not only on paper, but also in fact , Kickl said."
"Vienna. After the ÖVP's push for a new EU treaty, the FPÖ warns of far-reaching consequences for Austria. A new treaty could mean the abolition of the unanimity principle and even more EU centralism, said Harald Vilimsky, the Freedom Party's top candidate for the EU elections, on Sunday."
"Vienna. An EU Critic as EU Commissioner? If the FPÖ succeeds in becoming the strongest force in the European elections in May, it also wants to lay claim to the post of Austrian Commissioner. This was announced by the two FP top candidates Andreas Mölzer and Harald Vilimsky on Thursday."
"Vienna. Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen does not believe that the proposal by Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ) to weaken the free movement of persons within the EU is feasible.As Federal President, he should not talk about domestic affairs abroad, Van der Bellen said on Thursday at a press meeting with his Estonian counterpart Kersti Kaljulaid in Tallinn."
"Vienna. For the second time, Harald Vilimsky is leading the FPÖ as the top candidate in the EU elections - yet he prefers to be in Vienna rather than Brussels. He said this in a press chat on Monday."
Vienna. France's presidential election brought the FPÖ leader the final realisation that no election can be won with undifferentiated EU-bashing and demands for withdrawal. Heinz-Christian Strache professed his love for Europe in a first reaction in the ORF programme Im Zentrum.
"Vienna. In 2012, he called a duel between the SPÖ and the FPÖ for the next National Council election, in 2013 he compared the EU to a globally organised gang of robbers - and this year, too, FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had a main theme for his traditional speech shortly before the bank holidays. In his statement on neutrality, Strache warned 250 guests (according to the party) at Palais Auersperg on Tuesday that both sovereignty and neutrality were massively endangered."
"Vienna. Minister of Economics Reinhold Mitterlehner (ÖVP) has sent the Energy Efficiency Act, with which Austria implements the requirements of the EU Directive, for review. Last year there was no two-thirds majority for this in parliament, the FPÖ and the Greens had refused their approval. The Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Austrian Industries and the electricity industry had welcomed the failure of the Energy Efficiency Act in the last legislative period, they spoke of excessive targets and warned against excessive burdens for businesses."
"Vienna. Minister of the Interior Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) gathered his counterparts from the EU and Western Balkan countries yesterday for a security and migration conference at the Austria Center Vienna - and made it clear right from the start that the Austrian government's long-term plans on the sensitive refugee issue differ from those of the EU Commission in several points. For example, Kickl contradicted the call by Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos to abolish internal EU border controls in the near future."
"Vienna. On Wednesday, the National Council approved the EU's own resources decision with a broad majority - with the exception of the FPÖ - and gave the green light for the 750 billion euro budget. Euro Corona reconstruction fund from the EU."
"Vienna. The government's planned cut in family allowance for children living abroad is causing a firestorm in the Foreign Ministry: according to a report in the Kleine Zeitung, staff representatives are resisting massive deteriorations for Austrian diplomats abroad and complain about a lack of support from Minister Karin Kneissl (FPÖ). ÖVP and FPÖ want to adjust the family allowance for children living abroad in the EU to the price level there - usually this means a reduction. The government hopes to save 114 million euros annually."
"Vienna/Brussels. Chancellor Christian Kern expresses concern in the circle of his EU counterparts about a possible participation of the FPÖ in government after the National Council elections. It is considered blatantly anti-European, the SPÖ politician told journalists in Tallinn on Friday when asked if he had been approached about the FPÖ at the EU summit."
"Vigorous shift for the Danish People's Party This may not necessarily sound like a clash with the hard line that Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (S) has taken on immigration policy. Factually, it has seemed as if the Social Democrats and the Left are competing to be tougher on immigrants than the Danish People's Party. But when it comes to the EU, it's more complicated.Here, Thorning's government has long walked a tightrope between criticism of abuse of social benefits and then a fundamental respect for the EU's treaty right to free movement and equality of EU citizens across borders."
"Vote with your feet? It's no, for her: Some of us are making a fatal mistake, they think that by shunning the ballot box on 25 May, they will show their contempt for this EU they don't like [ ] but it's the opposite. The FN seems to fear that its electorate will say to itself: ""The municipal elections were good, now there is no need to go and vote"", said Jean-Yves Camus, a researcher specialising in the far right.The MEP, who is running for re-election in the North West constituency, focused her speech on the loss of sovereignty that France is currently suffering."
"Vox vetoed EL PAÍS' access to the presentation of its candidates for the European Parliament in retaliation for an article in which it was recalled that Buxadé was a candidate twice for Falange in 1995 and 1996 and that already in 2012 he praised José Antonio Primo de Rivera and Ernesto Giménez Caballero, ideologist of Spanish fascism. Vox is wary of Salvini's project to become the leader of the entire European far right and to unite it in a single group in the European Parliament. The secessionism that is at the origin of the Italian League and Salvini's own flirtations with the Catalan independentists, which forced Vox to protest angrily, generated a distrust between the two that has not yet been overcome."
"WORLD 42 / Will there be a polexit? PiS's attack on Brussels has made the attitude towards the EU the main divide in Polish politics, says political scientist Jacques Rupnik46 / Bishop's love story Spanish hierarch Xavier Novell Gomá left the Church because he fell in love"
"Was Salvini's square a classically right-wing one? I would say yes. Among other things, it is part of a European phenomenon that in some countries is even greater than in ours: against the EU and uncontrolled immigration.And can the League lead this wave? I have some doubts about that."
"We all need to highlight injustices - from housing to jobs. Apart from the already presented election campaign theme of criticism of the EU, what about the typical FPÖ theme of foreigners and the EU? Immigration?"
"We also sometimes have to point out developments that we don't like, and then you have to show the red card. Nevertheless, the party programme of the FPÖ applies, and it says that we are in favour of European integration, but against a centralised EU state.The idea of a European army you first welcomed, then rejected the next day."
"We could, for example, use more intelligent border controls. Morten Messerschmidt (DF) welcomes the Commission's proposal and calls it a step towards introducing permanent border controls, which is in line with the Danish People's Party's wishes. Basically, we should be happy about the smallest things in this EU system, so it is good that it will be easier to have border controls for a period, but it does not change the fundamental problem in Schengen, namely that you need permission from the EU to introduce border controls, he says. The proposal moves Schengen from being bad to being slightly less bad."
"We have been told it is a Muslim assassination. In your attitude to the EU we note a lurching course. In January, the FPÖ requested a referendum on withdrawal, in June you invited Ms Le Pen and a group of European parties working towards the destruction of the EU, then you welcomed Brexit, and only when it became clear that this was not very popular did you take it back. Now you want to improve the EU."
"We have undecided questions of fundamental importance. For example, the AfD's basic programme states that Germany's withdrawal from the EU is only the last resort. I think that's right."
"We just don't think it's a task that the EU should interfere in. Messerschmidt's post on Ilga is part of a series of posts under the heading 'EU fraud', documenting how the EU spends millions of Europeans' money on dubious projects every year. In DF we want more Denmark and less EU, and a good step in the right direction would be if the EU stopped spending citizens' money on value politics..That task belongs to the individual member states."
"We will support the Commission and its programme, said ÖVP MEP and Parliamentary Vice-President Othmar Karas. von der Leyen's team also receives support from Neos MEP Claudia Gamon. I will vote for the new Commission, says the liberal. She sees the abolition of unanimity in foreign policy matters as a significant reform project that Ursula von der Leyen should tackle immediately. FPÖ EU delegation leader Harald Vilimsky, on the other hand, announced that he would vote against the Commission."
"What a scandal. The EU-friendly old parties, as the AfD calls the Union and the SPD, are thus withholding from the voter the transfers due to the Commission. The coalition parties are thus cheating the electorate out of the necessary transparency because they fear that citizens might be outraged by the payments."
"What do you expect from the Five Star-League coalition? In particular, from the League, which is our ally, I expect them to solve the immigration problem and to show firmness also towards the European Union, so as to put an end to the austerity policies imposed by Brussels. Once upon a time the League took the Front National as a reference point, today the opposite happens? I don't think there is a hierarchy between our forces, I would rather say we walk hand in hand."
"What does Alternative fuer Deutschland expect from the meeting organized tomorrow in Milan by Matteo Salvini to launch the Alliance of European Peoples and Nations? Even if it doesn't start with us, the AfD has a big interest in building a strong group critical of the EU in the new European Parliament. At this stage, the main impetus is coming from Matteo Salvini's League and that suits us. We will see how this evolves, also with respect to Viktor Orbán's Fidesz, which at this stage is still in the European People's Party."
"What will happen to the EU's agricultural policy? At some point, we will probably have to cut back more. Recently, the FPÖ MEP Andreas Mölzer said he is in favour of halving the EU agricultural budget. That would be the end for organic farming."
"What's bothering you? When the leader of the League asks for full powers and frightens the EU, then he demonstrates his own sovereignist vocation: he brings with him an unspoken that pushes Italy to look to the countries of Eastern Europe.Visegrad people, the most skeptical."
"What's more, such an opinion already has much less party color. There are more opponents than supporters of including EU membership in the constitution among both Law and Justice supporters and among the European Coalition (as well as other committees). However, among those who declared to vote for PiS candidates on May 26th, the advantage is much bigger - 57 percent."
"When Karin Kneissl takes up her new job in the Foreign Ministry soon - on an FPÖ ticket - she will take over a department that carries less weight than under her predecessor. Because Sebastian Kurz is taking essential EU agendas with him to the Chancellery. The ÖVP and the FPÖ have agreed on this, as Die Presse learned on Tuesday. In this way, the ÖVP leader apparently wants to ensure structurally that the FPÖ cannot lead the federal government on an anti-European course."
"When Sarkozy and Hollande promised the end of tax havens The FN took the opportunity to torpedo its favourite enemy, the European Union, which is guilty of encouraging tax evasion in Ireland, the Netherlands and Malta. The Brussels technostructure, always so quick to regulate everything and anything, is absolutely absent here,"" denounced Marine Le Pen's group in a statement."
"When it comes to EU cooperation, I don't think voters are fundamentally sceptical about cooperation with Sweden, Finland, Germany and the rest of Europe. --On the contrary, they know that our welfare and jobs stand or fall with this cooperation, and that our recovery is largely due to the government's doing away with the foolishness that the Left and DF were up to with border fences and other symbols that were supposed to move Denmark away from the core of EU cooperation.Voters are unsure when the Left now goes further and says that we must not overimplement EU rules."
"When the Federal Chancellor speaks of a machine tax, an economic party like the ÖVP can only draw a line. The same applies when the FPÖ questions the EU. Because the future does not lie in nationalism and separatism."
"When the French from Télévision Française 1 appear shortly afterwards, it is to probe the politician's position on the impending referendum in Britain. With EU spokesman Kenneth Kristensen Berth at the forefront, the Danish People's Party has recently taken a more Eurosceptic line in connection with the British referendum.Here the British must either say yes to a new deal with the EU or leave after more than 43 years of membership."
"When the government calls a referendum on the legal and defence reservations sometime after the spring EU presidency, rising civic EU scepticism will undoubtedly be one of the big hurdles on the way. The bourgeois EU scepticism has split into two main tracks. The nationalist one, which the Danish People's Party and a not insignificant number of conservatives stand for. And the populist, which essentially draws on the legacy of Mogens Glistrup."
"When the premier assures that Italians can travel around Europe without infecting anyone, the League finds it hard to disagree. And when the Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza, assures that the EU ministers agree not to close the borders, he weakens the self-defeating propaganda of the League, and contrasts the anti-European vulgate of the right. But it is likely that once the practice of contagion is closed, the Carroccio will resume the offensive against the absent Europe; and M5S, Pd and Iv will find themselves at loggerheads in government."
"When you get to know the people and their politics, it often turns out that the picture that is drawn of them in Austria is not quite correct. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National, openly says that the EU must be destroyed.I do not hold this view.It is interesting that the FPÖ is in a group with the Front National in the European Parliament.Man needs these factions in Europe to be active."
"Where would that leave businesses, big or small? You could have the situation where an Irish company invests in a renewable energy project in, say Nebraska, and if the State changes its focus to fossil fuel the business has no protection, Mr Kelly said. While Fine Gael's four MEPs are supportive of the EU-US trade deals, Sinn Féin and a number of Independents are opposed to the deal.. Its MEP Matt Carthy called on Irish MEPs to vote against the ISDS."
"Whereby, according to the will of the Styrians, the ÖVP would also be well advised at the federal level not to close itself off to a possible coalition in the direction of the FPÖ. Even though General Secretary Werner Amon, also a Styrian, recently declared that it would be very difficult to involve the FPÖ in the government if it did not abandon its anti-EU stance. Anyone with any sense will keep all coalition options open, including Werner, I suppose, says Drexler."
"While that might not mean a lot in practical terms it would be likely to push the Conservatives into an even more anti-EU frame of mind and make it impossible for Cameron to hold out against a referendum. From the Irish point of view one of the deep ironies of the whole situation is that the three political parties in the UK most hostile to the EU are the Conservatives, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin.Considering the sinister role played by the Tories in blocking an independent all-Ireland parliament a century ago, there is something comic about Sinn Féin joining them and the heirs of the Ulster Covenanters, 100 years on, to fuel the anti-EU paranoia that underpins the British drive for withdrawal."
"While the DF can easily gain support among the population for their rejection of a common immigration policy, it is another matter when it comes to police cooperation and the fight against terrorism. The national conservative, flag-waving Danish People's Party can in no way stand to be shot in the shoes that it will compromise on Denmark's security and the safety of Danes because of a stubborn aversion to everything invented in Brussels.That is why the DF has admitted that this time the party can not just recommend a blank no to tamper with the reservation at all.New EU legislation will make judicial cooperation supranational within a year."
"While the Lisbon Treaty was rejected by voters at the first time of asking, it was passed in a second referendum after the Fianna Fáil government secured reassurances around Ireland's membership of the European Commission and military neutrality. The new Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage knows the Sinn Féin leader personally from their time together in the European Parliament and the two shared a platform together to fight Micheál Martin during the Fiscal Compact Treaty referendum in 2012, Mr Smith said.Sinn Féin's record on the European Union is clear, unambiguous and hiding in plain sight."
"Why is it that we don't want to be at the table when 10-12 European countries are trying to reach an agreement on a financial tax, when they very much want us to be there, and when it is the one of all the projects mentioned that the population has shown the most sympathy for? And how is it that it is the radicals, rather than anyone else, who do not even want to take part in the discussions? Pia Kjærsgaard MF ( DF), spokesperson on values: It is an absolutely amazing display of power by the President of the EU Parliament, Martin Schulz, when he allows himself to propose that Denmark and Great Britain be deprived of the right to vote in the EU on matters relating to the euro ( Pol. 20.10.)."
"Will the Polish Constitutional Court go toe-to-toe with the CJEU and the EU? There are many indications that it will, as it already threw down the gauntlet to the EU court in July. What could be the consequences if the Constitutional Court rules that key EU principles are unconstitutional? According to the case law of the Constitutional Tribunal before PiS took control of it, Poland will have three options: change the constitution, seek to change EU law, or leave the EU. Experts point out that a further deepening of the conflict with EU bodies is more likely, however."
"Wim van Leeuwen EU seatsWell in favor of a Nexit, but when it comes to the distribution of EU seats, the PVV'ers are fighting each other out of the tent. Nothing human is foreign to these politicians."
"With Le Pen, from left, allies. to the European Parliament Matteo Salvini, 41, federal secretary of the Northern League; Harald Vilimsky,47, of the Austrian Freedom Party (Fpö); Geert Wilders, 50, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party (Pvv);--Belgian Gerolf Annemans, 55, president of the Vlaams Belang, Flemish nationalist party"
"With one week to go before the European elections, this scandal comes at a bad time for Matteo Salvini and his main ally Marine Le Pen, president of the Rassemblement National (RN) in France. She assured a press conference that her movement respected the rules of financing political parties, while the RN is targeted in France by an investigation into alleged fictitious employment in the European Parliament.The two nationalist and identitarian tenors intend to weld together the alliance of twelve parties, all of which agree to fight immigration and Islamisation but are divided on budgetary discipline, the distribution of migrants entering the EU, and Russia."
"With the EU expansion into Eastern Europe from 2004, the increase in crisis and crime, rising migration pressure from Syria, North Africa or Iraq, the word Schengen triggers fears in many. Radical parties of the right, such as the Front National (FN) in France or the FPÖ, question it. FN leader It was recently agreed at the EU summit that refugees across the Mediterranean to Italy or Greece would increasingly be sent back immediately with the help of the authorities in the countries of refuge: without asylum procedures. NGOs, leftists and Greens criticise a Fortress Europe policy .Stricter entry controls are soon to be imposed at airports in response to the fact that hundreds of IS fighters have travelled to the Middle East in recent months."
"With the German right-wing populists of the AfD, the reaction was more mixed. Alexander Gauland regretted the Brexit. It is not so nice for Europe, said the AfD vice-president. We would like to have the British in Europe so that it works a little better. Beatrix von Storch was quite different: she cried with joy, said the AfD MEP."
"With the initiators of the Citizens' Committee EU, there had long been a desire to hold a referendum on the alleged lack of democracy in the European Union. As soon as the Consultative Referendum Act came into force in the Netherlands on 1 June 2015, they looked at which just-passed laws and treaties they believe will lead to a transfer of powers to 'Brussels'. They then sought help from weblog GeenStijl and the Forum for Democracy. According to Bart Nijman of GeenStijl, the association agreement with Ukraine shows well that the EU is quietly yet businesslike and purposefully expanding, stretching the electorate's mandate to the maximum in order to quietly pass major, sweeping decisions."
"With the voters of the FPÖ and the Team Stronach, which, however, is not contesting the EU elections, the intention to vote is lower than with other parties. The FPÖ in particular is finding it difficult to mobilise EU opponents to go to an election in which they are hardly interested. However, the poll results also show that the domestic parties have succeeded better this time than in 2009 in getting the Austrians in the mood for the election: 51 In 2009, 47 per cent of the respondents said they would definitely want to vote in the EU elections, 23 per cent were more likely to go to the polls."
"With these contradictions in mind, SF, Enhedslisten, Alternativet and the radicals all have major reservations about a more binding cooperation with DF. Jacob Mark finds it difficult to see how SF can act as a parliamentary basis for a government with S and DF, without the latter changing their minds on some of their very basic principles around international conventions and the EU. If we imagine that S and DF go into government, would that exclude SF from joining? I can't see SF joining a government in which the Danish People's Party participates. Although political spokesperson Pernille Skipper (EL) refuses to speculate on whether the Greens can support a government with the Danish People's Party, she says that whether it is the Danish People's Party, the Social Democrats or Santa Claus that forms a government, the Greens will fight for, among other things, green transition."
"Would it be right to take the same view facing into another election? Would Micheál Martin and co be right to resist tax cuts as a way of coping with Brexit fallout? The stance of Sinn Féin will be equally interesting. Ostensibly, it is now a supporter of Ireland's EU membership.But Sinn Féin is still an unlikely Europhile.It urged a No in every one of the nine EU referendums in the Republic from 1973 until 2012."
"Would something similar happen over the prospect of tax cuts? Fianna Fáil certainly read the runes correctly in the run-in to the last election, divining that voters were not ready for promises of tax cuts. Would it be right to take the same view facing into another election? Would Micheál Martin and co be right to resist tax cuts as a way of coping with Brexit fallout? The stance of Sinn Féin will be equally interesting. Ostensibly, it is now a supporter of Ireland's EU membership."
"Would the debt crisis be easier to manage in a different coalition constellation than the one between the SPÖ and the ÖVP? When you look at the other parties, you have to ask yourself different questions: The FPÖ doesn't want to change anything, the foreigners and the EU are to blame. And the others constantly see themselves as victims."
"Yes, it undoubtedly is, and it is certainly a reservation shared by many Europeans. In any case, EU scepticism is on the rise throughout Europe, if you look at the surveys that the EU itself is conducting.-- The European flag will not make its entrance into the parliamentary hall, if it is up to the DF. In fact, I would like the Danish Parliament to refrain from flying the EU flag on Europe Day 9 May - precisely because the EU flag is so divisive."
"Yesterday he had called Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt ( S) to a debate in Parliament to define where Denmark should place itself in an EU with flexible cooperation. In the debate, it became clear that both the former and current government parties want Denmark to be at the heart of the EU.The Danish People's Party does not share this view, but Kristian Thulesen Dahl nevertheless believes that it is perfectly possible to agree with the Left on some formulations of EU policy in a joint government basis. The DF's demand will be referendums if two different types of questions arise."
"Yesterday, the European Affairs Committee of the Danish Parliament received a visit from the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michael Barnier, who briefed them on the EU's line ahead of the negotiations, which will not begin in earnest until after the British general election on 8 June. The Danish People's Party's EU spokesperson was also disappointed by that meeting. No, I don't think so. The EU has too much focus on settling scores - rather than moving forward and getting a good relationship with the UK.I really fear that the hard line will prevent progress, says Kenneth Kristensen Berth."
"Yet it has become a Danish tradition that one government after another takes our international privileges so much for granted that they build their parliamentary majority on parties that are disloyal to our international roots. Only stupidity or irresponsibility can explain why the Left wants to build on the Danish People's Party, which still speculates in EU resistance and is not firm on Denmark's commitment to universal human rights.Liberal Alliance similarly speculates on an EU critique that does not allow the Left to work to get out of the reservations - at least not with the ultra-liberal alliance as its parliamentary base."
"Yet, if Berlusconi's star is not yet extinguished, his star has faded considerably, while that of Matteo Salvini, the young leader of the Northern League, is in full ascendancy. It intends to be the centre of the right-wing galaxy for the legislative elections and has Marine Le Pen's National Front as its model. His anti-immigration, anti-EU and anti-euro party enjoys greater momentum in public opinion than Forza Italia. He would be the populist and extremist soul of a centre-right coalition, which intends to present itself as moderate and as a remedy to the populist threat."
"Your reservations about voting for the party that was once not stable have thus disappeared. The party has been riding a wave of general EU scepticism throughout the election campaign.Morten Messerschmidt looks set to secure the Danish People's Party its best election ever, and the big win is something that is being noticed at Christiansborg.At the same time, Lars Løkkes gets a voter loyalty award for his outstanding debts to voters for clothes and travel."

But the impression is that it was almost called by M5S and Lega, to use it for electoral purposes.

That, if anything, was the initial position of the Five Star and League, nuanced and changed shortly before and after the elections of March 4, 2018: also because the polls, the only polar star of the current political forces, have made it clear that public opinion votes Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, but does not want monetary and international adventurism. In this respect, the chaos that followed the UK's Brexit referendum in June 2016 was a formidable deterrent to those who strove to emulate that collective political and economic suicide."

It should be a sign that their harmony endures, despite the fact that they belong to different groups; and despite the fact that Orbán has been suspended for six months from the European People's Party for his internal politics and excessive closeness to groups hostile to the Brussels institutions such as the League.

"--And it has taken 7 years to negotiate CETA, leading former Canadian Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew and others to conclude in The Times that CETA is not suitable for Britain. Britain's eventual membership is of particular interest to the Danish People's Party, which has previously demanded a referendum on whether Denmark should leave the EU at that time and seek the same membership. Still, Kenneth Kristensen Berth will not answer whether the DF would be prepared to swap Denmark's EU membership for a Canadian model."
"--But then the 'Vote Loser', as he is also called, certainly also took the consequences of all the boring formal mistakes and left the responsible post as chairman for himself and the two other members of the Danish People's Party group in the European Parliament. This will hopefully give Messerschmidt time again to throw himself into the fight against all the cheating and freeloading with EU citizens' money that takes place in Brussels.Despite the 'Vote Loser', there was very little support from home, where the DF leadership did not utter a peep in his defence.Party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl would probably not even react if you stood up in front of him and slapped him hard on the forehead to get a comment on Morten Messerschmidt's troubles."

So you pay the EU so that the DF can tell you how stupid the EU is."

"--Not least the Danish members of the European Parliament have expressed their outrage at the revelations of Luxembourg's shady tax practices, which Politiken and a large number of other media in the international network ICIJ published last week. It is perhaps not surprising that sceptics like Morten Messerschmidt of the Danish People's Party and Rina Ronja Kari of the People's Movement Against the EU are seizing the opportunity to call for the sacking of a man whose appointment they have never supported. EUROPEAN ANALYSIS Despite many accusations of ineptitude, neither governments nor the EP have the courage to threaten the new EU chief."
"--Otherwise, the Social Democrats' continued vote losses - which the media have made light of - may be linked to the contentious EU issue of harmonising welfare systems. The vote is a slap in the face to the S, but it has not driven voters to vote for any party that wants out of the EU, rather to parties that want something different with the EU.TO JOIN Syriza in Greece with the Danish People's Party in Denmark and the Feminist Initiative in Sweden makes no sense beyond talking about an indefinable trust problem. Overall, the so-called extremist and Eurosceptic parties get one in six votes in the new European Parliament, depending on how you slice it."
"--The leader of Britain's fiercest anti-EU United Kingdom Independence Party (Ukip) has said he hopes to see a British exit followed by a Danish exit from the union. Political chaos following a UK 'no' vote to the EU could spark calls for a new renegotiation. If so, the DF will follow, but is the plan realistic? I think Denmark will follow us out."
"--The task facing the head of the Conte government is no less easy, a job that is undoubtedly uphill; trying to impose a candidate from the League means exposing Italy to resistance from the rest of the new Commission and even from Parliament, in which each commissioner must pass a hearing that is by no means a foregone conclusion. A Lega exponent will be a reflection of a party that will not be part of the majority in the EU government, and the heavier the portfolio - they say Salvini is aiming for Competition, certainly among the top three in the Commission - the more uphill the chances of getting it.The risk, therefore, is that of a race to the bottom, of having to settle for an intermediate portfolio in order to place a sovereignist exponent of Industry or Agriculture in a committee that might not digest him, seeing him as a foreign element."
"--This is not just about new tightening measures, but fundamental changes to Danish asylum and integration policy. According to both the government and independent lawyers, the DF's return of asylum seekers to Germany would be in violation of the EU's Dublin Regulation, which is the framework for common asylum cooperation.The Danish People's Party thinks otherwise, but obviously wants to get out."
"--it is safe to assume that PM May is less than amused that the opposition politician had been given precedence over her. But more crucially, the EU is confronted with anti-EU, nationalist movements in all central countries.

The traditional majority, made up of Europopulars, Euro-socialists and Euro-liberals, pushed through a proposal for a regulation that aims to make the disbursement of EU funds in the next budget 2021-2027 conditional on respect for the rule of law and appropriate measures against corruption."

"0 Eurosceptic parties often vote for EU laws The Danish People's Party normally describes itself as Eurosceptic and wants a referendum on Denmark's EU membership similar to the one the British had last year. But if you look at how the party votes on EU issues, it doesn't seem so sceptical at all."
"0 Euroskeptics in euro parliament most often earn a little extra More than half of the 35 members of Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), which includes, for example, the PVV and Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National, say they have side income.. View original page:"
"0 Extremist and anti-EU League? No, we will be better known by popular and socialists The interview MILAN President Riccardo Molinari, but has Europe changed or are you changing to find a new position?The facts show - explains the head of the Carroccio group at the Chamber - that the League's recipes for dealing with the economic emergency, both pre-Covid and post, have proved to be right."

"0 From the House and Senate symmetrical signals In the House the PDL votes its own motion on the EU, separate from that of the rest of the majority. In the Senate, the PDL and the League vote on the federal Senate. These are symmetrical signals, Minister for Relations with Parliament Piero Giarda said last night after confirming the resignation of reform rapporteur Vizzini."
"0 Front page reference: Minister gives DF cold EU debt No sooner has DF chair Kristian Thulesen Dahl celebrated his election victory bathed in applause and flashbulbs, before the V government welcomes reality with a rejection of one of the party's main demands in the EU field.In the view of the DF chair, the government's EU election defeat should lead to a markedly different - and far more sceptical - EU policy in Denmark. Therefore, a new EU line must be enshrined in a European policy agreement in which the 'no' parties in Parliament are on board, says Kristian Thulesen Dahl."

"0 Game won on the domestic front and on the EU At the end of a day of parliamentary guerrilla warfare in the Senate, where M5S and League have competed to tighten the session, the Jobs Act, the delegation to the government on labor market reform, passed with a vote of confidence. Matteo Renzi, engaged in the European summit on unemployment, has been in Milan several times, fearing a postponement of the vote and leaking a certain resentment towards the president of the Senate Grasso, who suspended the session twice, the first time during the speech of Minister Poletti, harshly contested by the grills.S'è reduced to a minimum, the patrol of senators close to Pippo Civati, the dissent of the minority PD, which for the part bersaniana and dalemiana has instead announced the vote in favor of the government and a document of 35 parliamentarians who ask to change the text of the reform in the House."
"0 Giallo sul vertice della vigilanza Ue A Enria misses the vote of the League The Italian government goes to the clash with Europe, but does not seem interested in defending its interests in the EU rooms. Yesterday, while the EU summits in Brussels were rejecting the Italian manoeuvre, a curious fact happened in the Strasbourg Parliament."
"0 Giorgetti, Salvini and the EU operation SEVEN The pro-European design of the League has a national implication: the road to Brussels passes through Rome.--This is the project Giorgetti is working on, which aims to build the political conditions to ensure a leading role for the Carroccio when Conte comes to the end of the line at the beginning of the new year."
"0 Giorgetti, the League discovers the EU The vice-president wants to strengthen the ties of the League with Merkel and Germany Everyone looks for him and admires him: Giancarlo Giorgetti, Superstar. Cited and praised, indicated and proposed, appreciated and respected, even Cardinal Ruini wrote to him (who asked him to establish a relationship of collaboration with the parties that are permanently at the helm of the European Union)."
"0 Giovnòt of the League and Cinquestelle, believe me, the time has come to capitulate to the EU: give in now or later it will be worse Alexis Tsipras is wise: Give in now, later it will be worse. He says it because he tried it For Giuseppe Conte, for Luigi Di Maio, for Matteo Salvini the time has come to lift the foot off the accelerator, to bend to the wishes of Brussels, said in plain language: capitulate."
"0 Government rejects DF offer The government says no to the Danish People's Party's offer to trade EU referendums so that the government can avoid calling a referendum on the patent court if it instead commits to calling a referendum on Danish accession to the EU banking union. PEOPLE'S VOTE The Danish People's Party can forget about swapping a referendum on the banking union for one on the patent court, according to the Europe minister."

It's not like you can pull a ride pass to a theme park with referendums and then choose the vote you want."
"0 Grillini-Lega: always closer They agree on many issues such as: no immigrants, anti EU and euro, no banks and anti PD The lone riders and a bit 'snob of the Movement of Grillo continue to deny, but, in fact, have begun to dialogue a bit 'in all directions: especially civil society and the League. They deny any contact with the League, but at the Garda d'autore exhibition Di Maio was interviewed by Gianluigi Nuzzi and, in the same evening and in the same place, Matteo Salvini was to be interviewed, but he stood up and was represented by his deputy Giancarlo Giorgetti."
"0 Halting from Brussels on budget constraints BRUSSELS Germany and France led the many preemptive reminders from Europe, to the government in formation between M5S and Lega, on compliance with EU budget constraints. In addition, drafts with proposed strict technical recommendations to Italy for its failure to contain its maxi-debt and structural deficit, which the European Commission is scheduled to agree today in Brussels, have been leaked by Eurobureaucrats in tune with Northern commissioners committed to making them heavier to discourage the implementation of trigger-leftist election promises."
0 His criticism is not mild Barry Madlener (43) speaks on behalf of the PVV on Europe and his criticism of Brussels is usually not mild. The Netherlands pays way too much to the European Union and actually everyone with this cabinet is the loser.
"0 House of Representatives sharply rejects EU calculation A majority in the House of Representatives is not prepared to pay the 642 million euro EU levy to Brussels. VVD, CDA and PVV want to question Prime Minister Rutte and Finance Minister Dijsselbloem about this in the House on Tuesday.."
"0 House of Representatives suddenly needs EU Euroscepticism? Most parties expect not less but more from Brussels, it appears during the Europe debate in the House. No or less Europe, that's what the PVV and SP want to settle. In Brussels, that is."
"0 How to explain the several years of yelling at the EU? Krystyna Pawowicz's statements have been a symbol of the Law and Justice party's approach to the European Union for the last few years. Politicians of this party have always tried to emphasize the EU's flaws and have accused it of all possible sins. The goal, however, was not Poland's exit from the EU (although the example of Brexit shows that such an outcome can also be achieved unintentionally)."
"0 I regret having been in the PP, not in Falange Question: What does Vox think of the European Union? Answer: We make an assessment with blacks and whites, but we believe that it is at a critical moment and that the future cannot be more federalization or more government for Brussels, but to become strong in the respect of sovereign nations. Q.- Do you consider yourselves euroskeptics? A.- If by Eurosceptic we mean defending that Spain has to leave the Union, obviously not, but if we change the label to Euro-realists or Euro-demanding, we are in a position for Spain to exercise all the rights it has in Europe."
"0 If the Netherlands leaves the EU... The Netherlands was one of the most Europhile countries, now the PVV proposes to leave the European Union. But our country, as a trading nation, actually benefits from integration."
"0 Iglesias and Mélenchon unite against fascism in the EU Pablo Iglesias and Jean-Luc Mélenchon yesterday reaffirmed the alliance between Podemos and France Insoumise, the radical left movement leading the opposition to Emmanuel Macron, with a message critical of EU austerity policies and the strategy agreed at the last European summit to respond to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Europe is in a very bad way."
"0 In Pontida under the usual cloudburst Salvini: Fight against the EU monster. Lega Nord They moved the date from May to September but the result has not changed: cloudburst on Pontida and mud on the lawn. The cloud of every year also followed this time the leghista rally, and since this time the event takes place in three days, it began to dump water since Friday."
"0 In the government is hunting for the guilty League convinced that the leak on the EU letter is the fault of the M5S And Salvini challenges Brussels: We'll see who has the hardest head Who of little hand wounds of little hand perishes. The League is convinced of this, suspecting that it was their allies (assuming you can still use this adjective for the 5 Stars) to pass, Friday afternoon, to the media the text of the letter of response of the Italian government to the findings of the European Commission on our public accounts, passing it off as the final one and thus allowing that pincer movement of Prime Minister Conte and Deputy Di Maio on the Minister of Economy, Giovanni Tria, forced first to deny and then to correct (actually only in form, not in substance) the letter sent in the night in Brussels."
"0 It goes towards a government M5s-Lega Facilitated also by the declaration of absolute loyalty to the Atlantic and the EU made by Di Maio Eppur si muove, it can be said, referring to the political situation after the first round of consultations and waiting for the one scheduled for next week and, perhaps, a third useful to allow the 5Stelle to face in full serenity the local elections at the end of the month. In the final balance, some significant items should be indicated: the center-right presented itself at the Quirinale in a separate form, each party on its own."
"0 Kaczynski threatens to veto EU budget: We are dealing with an attempt to take away our sovereignty An excerpt from an interview with the PiS leader for Gazeta Polska Codziennie appeared on Kaczynski was asked about a serious battle with those who want to impose their values on us within the EU or even subjugate us. - I will call these actions by their proper name: we are dealing with an attempt to take away our sovereignty, even in the sphere of culture, responded the Law and Justice president."
"0 League and Fdi in Brussels abstain on rules There is the first yes First green light of the EU Parliament to the regulation on the governance of the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the main instrument from 672.5 billion Next Generation Eu. The combined Budget and Econ committees gave the OK with 78 votes in favor, 5 against and 13 abstentions."
"0 League in the EPP? Giorgetti's move: I do not exclude it Alliances in the EU The stone in the pond was thrown by the former Carroccio undersecretary to the Council presidency, Giancarlo Giorgetti: The League in the European People's Party? I would not exclude it a priori. With the Bavarian Csu, for example, there are many elements of consonance, he replied to Lucia Annunziata who interviewed him at Mezz'ora in più. An opening to that Ppe that in Brussels and Strasbourg the League is fighting hard, but which also includes Fidesz, the party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Matteo Salvini's ally, as the Magyar leader defined it in the letter of greetings at the end of the yellow-green government."

"0 League-M5s backfire against EU sanctions on Putin over Navalny case. But on Lukashenko, the Cricketers vote with Pd, FI and FdI Backfire between former government allies Lega and M5s, in the EU parliament, in the name of Vladimir Putin."
"0 League-M5s, is clash with the EU Altolà of Brussels on migrants and accounts. Salvini: unacceptable."
"0 Left: New vote does not necessarily require DF support It is not necessarily a prerequisite for a new isolated referendum on continued membership of Europol that the Danish People's Party recommends a yes vote.So says the Liberal Party's EU spokesman, Jan E. It is a misinterpretation to think that a new vote on Europol depends on support from the Danish People's Party, says the leader of the Left."
"0 M5s and Lega, no to the EU budget IMF sees black on Italy. In Palermo Haftar-Serraj handshake."
"0 Macron is only pretending to find a solution for migrants at sea I will premise that the League and M5s have done everything to be marginalized from the EU of which, moreover, Italy is one of the founding countries and, after the now irreversible Brexit next October, is also the second country by manufacturing capacity and the third by economic importance. The M5s, in these last weeks (and in particular by contributing decisively, with its 14 votes in the Europarliament, to the election, otherwise impossible, of the German president Von der Leyen), has attenuated, to the point of almost cancelling it, its prejudicial rejection of the EU and the euro.Salvini, on the other hand, has remained on pro-European prejudicial positions, while if he wants to have a future as a statesman (and at the European level this space exists) he must radically change his game plan, focusing more on a subtle policy of alliances to be built in the corridors of the European institutions than on bombastic tweets that only have the effect of boomerang for those who launch them without evaluating their scope in advance."
"0 Manoeuvre, part of the letter to the EU Alt of League and M5S to the opening of Tria ROME It will take all day today, and a good dose of commitment and diplomacy, to finalize the government's response to the EU Commission, which asks to change the maneuver of 2019.Between the Ministry of Economy, Palazzo Chigi and the two deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, the positions on the line to oppose to Brussels are still very distant. Open to dialogue and to some concessions the holder of the accounts, Giovanni Tria."
"0 Margallo defends the understanding with the United Kingdom in the face of criticism from the PSOE and Podemos The Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel García Margallo, defended the European summit to reach an agreement with Great Britain to facilitate its permanence in the EU, a matter on which the groups in Congress showed their skepticism or, in the case of Podemos, their rejection. In the first appearance of a member of the incumbent government before the new Congress, Margallo explained the position that Rajoy will defend at the European Council today and tomorrow: to support the bulk of the proposal put forward by the President of the Council, Donald Tusk."
"0 Margallo obtains the support of the majority of the Congress The acting Government obtained yesterday in the Congress of Deputies a majority support, with some dose of skepticism, to the position that Mariano Rajoy will defend between today and tomorrow in Brussels to ensure that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union. Only Podemos completely dissociated itself from the agreement and demanded not to give in to David Cameron's blackmail, with a proposal that would weaken the EU and that would mean its death certificate, according to Pablo Iglesias, who without being a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee participated as the first spokesman of his group. I ask the acting government not to compromise the future of Spain and not to accept the document on the United Kingdom, Iglesias said."
"0 My draft did not include a farewell to the euro and the EU Treaties. How far is the yellow-green government contract of the League and Five Stars from the work of the now well-known professor Giacinto Della Cananea? The interested party always answers with academic detachment: The fact that politicians have put their hands on the program is obviously a good thing. But with different premises, the results are different."
"0 Note It is utopian to believe that Denmark can introduce a reservation in the area of welfare, as Enhedslisten and Dansk Folkeparti plead for in connection with the debate on child benefits for EU citizens. The Conservatives' leading candidate in the EU parliamentary elections, Bendt Bendtsen, says: Demanding a reservation for little Denmark is not on."
"0 Note MEP Morten Messerschmidt ( DF) is furious about Copenhagen Cathedral's decision to hold a service marking the start of the Danish EU Presidency.To Berlingskes News Agency he says: I want a people's church that can accommodate people who are just as jubilantly European as I am Eurosceptic, and that becomes very difficult when you want to use the church in this way to mark an EU event."
"0 Note Morten Messerschmidt (DF) proposes to abolish EU agricultural subsidies and structural aid. But Danish agriculture would be hit hard, and it is unthinkable that this will happen, says Professor Peter Nedergaard, Department of Political Science at the University of Copenhagen, to Ritzau: We benefit from the support schemes, especially from the agricultural policy, and then there is the most important thing: This is completely on the moon when it comes to political realities Photo: Per Folkver."

"0 Overview: allegations of misuse of EU funds In a 13-page memo, Secretary General Klaus Welle of the European Parliament accuses Morten Messerschmidt (DF) and other EU sceptics of extensive misuse of EU funds in the Meld and Feld funds.

"0 POLITICO: Welfare under pressure When the UK government and the Danish People's Party introduced new rules for the accrual of child benefit in 2010, following a debate on EU citizens' entitlement to Danish welfare benefits, the then opposition warned that the proposal was in breach of EU rules. The welfare state is based on principles of solidarity."
"0 PP, PSOE and C's charge against Podemos for its attacks on the EU MADRIDThe closing of the campaign was marked yesterday by the victory of the Eurosceptics in the referendum held in the United Kingdom.

0 PVV commissions 2.7 tons of anti-EU research with subsidy from House of Representatives The Hague PVV leader Geert Wilders appears to have commissioned a reputable British agency this summer to conduct a new study into the costs of a Dutch exit from the EU.
"0 PVV program: done with Europe The elections on September 12 will be 'one big referendum on everything to do with the EU' if it is up to the PVV. From the euro and the European emergency fund ESM to immigration, mortgage interest deductions and the Hedwigepolder, PVV leader Geert Wilders announced yesterday morning."
"0 Pac reform, cuts for 2.7 billion No of Southern Europe BRUSSELS Governments of France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Finland have rejected the proposal of the European Commission of Luxembourg's Jean Claude Juncker with heavy cuts to EU funds for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU budget for the period 2021-2027. The new Italian executive with M5S and Lega appears oriented to add to the opposition to the Brussels institution because, according to EU sources, national farmers would risk losing about 2.7 billion, equal to a reduction of about 7% compared to the disbursements provided in the period 2014-2020. Environmental organizations, which have always opposed EU funding for industrial agriculture, have also objected to the Commission's proposal because it offers almost no protection for health, the environment and the climate and because it underestimates the goal of producing nutritious and healthy food. European farmers' associations argued that it needs to be significantly improved and supported by a stronger budget."
"0 Parties want to see EU letters Ministers' communication with EU Commissioners needs to be much more visible than it is today. The Danish People's Party is now proposing this in the wake of last week's story that Justice Minister Morten Bødskov (S) - according to critics and, incidentally, an EU spokesman - wrote one to Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding and another to the Danish media and Parliament about the upcoming change to deportation rules. CONTROL The accusations against the Minister of Justice for speaking with two tongues to Parliament and the EU are prompting parties on both sides to demand transparency."
"0 Pd, Lega and M5S aligned against EU constraints The case ROME Maybe it won't be necessary, although research institutes say the coronavirus could cost the Italian economy €25 billion. Perhaps the flexibility already provided for in the European Union's budget rules, which take into account exceptional circumstances, such as an earthquake or an epidemic, will suffice."
"0 Pd, anti-League flags to support the EU And arrives the premier Renzi Towards the vote The Lombard Pd will distribute to its militants 2,500 flags of Europe to display in view of the elections on May 25 and awaits a tour of the secretary (and premier) Matteo Renzi for the last weekend of the election campaign. On May 9, the feast of Europe - explained yesterday the regional secretary Alessandro Alfieri - we launch our mobilization for the Europeans: since the Secretary of the League Salvini invites to lower the flags of Europe, we have distributed to our sections and our militants to expose them."
"0 Podemos and nationalists vote in the EU against the interests of Spain They refused to withdraw a text that linked Gibraltar with problems for air transport The Popular group in the European Parliament has managed to remove from the text of the Transport White Paper a mention that urged the EU Council to seek ways to intervene in the negotiation between Spain and the United Kingdom on Gibraltar. Luis de Grandes, a member of the European Parliament, demanded and obtained that the Strasbourg plenary agree to withdraw the paragraph in which it was implied that the Spanish-British dispute had become an obstacle to the development of air transport."
"0 Polarization about Europe helps PVV The Hague. Dutch have become more extreme in their views about the European Union. The number of opponents has grown the most, but the number of staunch supporters of Europe is also growing."
"0 Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denies information about support for Poland and Hungary over the EU budget veto This is a statement quoted by the daily Público by Witold Waszczykowski, a Law and Justice (PiS) deputy and former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who claimed that during the recent EU summit Portugal supported Poland and Hungary in their efforts to block the mechanism making the disbursement of money from the EU budget conditional on respect for the rule of law. Although the mechanism was negotiated in July with the full approval of Prime Ministers Mateusz Morawiecki and Viktor Orbán, Warsaw and Budapest are now threatening other EU countries that if the mechanism is adopted, they will veto the new EU budget for 2021-27 and the Reconstruction Fund, which is supposed to get EU economies back on their feet after the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic."
"0 Pro-EU League benefits Italy It may already have influenced the spread reduction because it reduces country risk The pragmatic non-Eurodivergent turn of the Italian right may be one of the reasons for the sharp drop in the spread because it reduces the political component of the redenomination risk. If this is the case, i.e. if it is confirmed that the assessors of the sustainability of the Italian debt price the risk premium downwards due to this political factor, then it would be in the interest of the national financial system that the right-wing itself takes more steps towards Euro-convergence."

"0 Right-wing populist bloc already in danger of falling apart PVV leader Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen of the Front National have only just laid the foundations for a new right-wing populist bloc in the European Parliament or the first cracks are already appearing in the future alliance. The Danish People's Party (DF), which like the PVV is skeptical of the European Union and in favor of stricter immigration rules, announced Thursday that it sees nothing in cooperation with the Front National."
"0 Russia finances anti-EU parties. Putin is allegedly secretly funding Eurosceptic EU parties, such as - the Telegraph claims - the League in Italy, the Front National in France and Jobbik in Hungary.

"0 Rutte gives in to Van Rompuy DEN HAAG Prime Minister Mark Rutte is resigned to the introduction of contracts with which Brussels can bind euro countries to spending cuts. To the anger of PVV and SP, who believe that the Netherlands would give up sovereignty, Rutte will not oppose this proposal of EU President Herman van Rompuy at the EU summit today and tomorrow. According to Rutte, the contracts are `little new under the sun' compared to the budget agreements to which the Netherlands is already bound."
"0 Rutte suddenly stands firm for EU, challenges PVV over Nexit A bizarre experiment. Total chaos."
0 Salvini between Brexit and the blessing of two parish priests Only on Friday it had seemed that the League was reviewing its position on Europe. But last night in Sedrina Matteo Salvini stressed: We work to change Europe.
0 Salvini challenges the EU on accounts and makes the spread skyrocket Di Maio: Irresponsible Between the League and the Five Star Movement the latest duel is on the debt. Salvini challenges the European Union on the accounts and makes the spread skyrocket to 280. Di Maio's reply to the Confindustria summit: irresponsible.
"0 Salvini reaffirms his sovereignism The analysis It is really singular that in the midst of the debate (and negotiations) to build a more cohesive center-right array able to intercept the decisive vote of moderates, Matteo Salvini has decided to join Giorgia Meloni in signing the document that promotes European sovereignty and sets as a reference point Viktor Orbán and Marine Le Pen. The adhesion of the leader of the League will have been determined by the fear of electoral competition in case FdI would have ascribed itself the copyright of the initiative, but this does not justify the schizophrenia of a behavior that on the one hand supports a decidedly pro-European government and is proposing a federation with Forza Italia, a party that has in its DNA the support to a united and increasingly supranational Europe, on the other hand it places itself side by side with those who do not want progress on the European union. At stake is the future of the economy and therefore the degree of well-being of the Continent."
"0 Salvini: Away with the embargo on Russia There is one more problem for Sergio Mattarella, the attack on Syria raises the debate on sanctions against Russia and the pro-Putin front led by Matteo Salvini already threatens to break with the rest of the EU on the issue of sanctions against Moscow. The leader of the League takes back the scene after Silvio Berlusconi criticized Salvini's position on missiles against Assad: With us in government, sanctions against Russia are the first thing to jump. A position immediately supported also by Giovanni Toti (Sanctions are not serving) and similar also to the one supported so far by M5S."

"0 Sovereignist axis, Giorgetti cold: I have not read the manifesto on the EU MILAN The attitude towards Europe back to ripple the waters of the League. Those who have seen in Matteo Salvini's signing of the Charter of Values with the leaders of 15 other sovereignist and conservative parties, from Giorgia Meloni to Viktor Orbán, a deviation from the more recent pro-European line, concretized in the support to the Draghi government, find confirmation in the embarrassments, diplomatically managed with ad hoc statements, of the protagonists."

"0 Sánchez stages his turn to the left with a sudden rejection of the EU-Canada agreement The Socialists are getting closer to Podemos and advance that they will go from 'yes' to abstention or 'no' The turn to the left of Pedro Sánchez has already a first practical embodiment. Only one month after having strongly rejected in Congress an amendment to the totality presented by Podemos against CETA, the free trade agreement signed by the European Union and Canada last October 30, the PSOE has changed its position."
0 Sánchez: If the extremes attack us we are in the best place Brexit and the rivalry with Unidos Podemos and its threat of sorpasso to the PSOE on 26-J have been the axes around which Pedro Sánchez's final rally in Seville has revolved. The socialist candidate has closed the campaign with Susana Diaz in their only joint act of these 15 days.
"0 That Europe's no to the Interbank Fund The Brussels comment Hard words against the European Commission have launched them MEPs from M5S, Forza Italia and Lega. But also in the PD have challenged the decision of Brussels to reject the first rescue plan with intervention of the Interbank Deposit Guarantee Fund, which is funded by private banks. And which would have prevented savers from having their securities wiped out by the subsequent rescue of Banca Marche, Etruria, CariChieti and CariFerrara."

While sceptics like the Danish People's Party and opponents like France's nationalists can barely keep their arms down, Europe's leaders must now brace themselves for tough negotiations over Britain's future in the union. EUROPEAN ANALYSIS Many months of tug-of-war across the English Channel now await Europe's governments."
"0 The EU is at a crossroads: either it moves forward or it falls The analysis Beyond the official communiqués at the conclusion of the summit between the heads of government, it will be necessary to verify whether, when and how the issue of European government bonds will take place, i.e., who will win among those who, once the cameras are turned off, will row in favor and who will row against: the dispute goes beyond Eurobonds, it is a question of putting Europe back on the road or reciting the de profundis.The EU is caught between two fires. In Italy, it is reductive to consider the contrary vote in parliament by the Lega and Fd'I on Eurobonds solely as an anti-government measure. That attitude also created perplexity because it added to the rejection of the Mes."
"0 The EU is not just an income transfer union for Finns On Tuesday, the Finnish Parliament will debate an interim question on the EU's stimulus package. The True Finns, with the support of the Christian Democrats and the Now movement, are trying to bring down the government.

"0 The EU will finance the Tav at 50% It is still quarrelling about the referendum The League: Excellent Almost a month after the avis de marché of the tender for the works of the Turin-Lyon reopens the chapter Tav with the pressing of Europe to the government: Brussels yesterday said it was ready to finance 50% of the work. A move that seems to meet the requests to the EU for more funding arrived in recent days by the vice-premier Matteo Salvini, who comments: Tav, great news and one more reason to do it."
"0 The Fdi-Lega alliance starts from the South The Carroccio, with Salvini, is looking for space, not only in the North, but also throughout the country From the stop to illegal immigration to security policies and the defense of the traditional family, to the exit from the euro and the battle against the European Union of bankers, Lega Nord and Fratelli d'Italia - Alleanza Nazionale have very similar ideas, if not exactly the same. This is the reason why in recent times the two parties have been getting closer and closer, due on the one hand to the mutation that the Carroccio is experiencing under the leadership of Matteo Salvini, and on the other hand to the project of rebirth of a social right wing launched by Giorgia Meloni, who is certainly not a new face in politics but has on her side the anagraphic advantage that other leaders, such as Ignazio La Russa, obviously cannot make weight."
"0 The League does not cross the red line The interview Vice-President of the EU Parliament Castaldo, Juncker called some ministers liars. Coming from someone who for years defended the austerity measures in Greece and Southern Europe, only to limit himself to a belated and hypocritical maybe we did something wrong..."
0 The League renounces to a million for refugees Funding already allocated by the EU for two reception projects in Trento Some say no. Even in the face of a million euros.
"0 The League shoots the EU with his mouth Even if the battle against the euro has rewarded the European passing from 4 to 6% of the vote The air of recovery and the League is better. The abyss had been reached with the scandals, which had overwhelmed the same family of Umberto Bossi."
"0 The Netherlands must leave the EU, support for Afrikaans The PVV's election program Next Thursday, Geert Wilders will be in the House of Representatives for 5,000 days. When he stepped down from the VVD in 2004, he came up with a declaration of independence."
"0 The attempt to remove the forecasts of recession The Note On one thing the majority is found, beyond the decision to clash at the table from here to the European elections in late May: remove the criticism that comes to the economic maneuver from international institutions, and, in parallel, hammering against the EU Commission. This is one of the very few points that unite the Five Star Movement and the League at this moment. Even if in the first one a hint of concern is admitted, overcome in the name of the need to solve a social emergency."
"0 The leader of the League raises taxes (and attacks the EU) THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT 2019 The Tav? The 36 percent in Piedmont is almost equivalent to a referendum rome In the hours of the great emotion for the over two million preferences, Matteo Salvini does not forget the advice of Giorgetti: Keep on your desk a picture of Renzi.... And so, in a press conference at the Viminale, the winner admonishes himself: There is a namesake of mine who won the European elections with 40% and then lost contact with reality."
"0 The numbers EU totally camped in the air Our estimate of development is conservative Claudio Borghi, League, President of the Budget Committee in Montecitorio, is ready to give battle on the numbers of the maneuver. Because those coming out of the EU Commission yesterday would be totally out of the blue."
"0 The route to less migration and less EU column One of the better-kept secrets in recent years was that there was a majority in the House of Representatives, supported by PVV and FVD, for a much stricter migration policy and a more EU-critical policy. It never showed in the votes because the Rutte III cabinet had a detailed coalition agreement: the proponents of less migration and more EU criticism in the coalition, VVD and CDA, kept to the agreements they made in the formation with D66 and CU."
"0 The wrath of the 5 Stelle base for the turn of Grillo And the League: that somersault Parties rome The European Union must change, otherwise it dies. Yesterday's long post on Beppe Grillo's blog continues with the tones of analysis and not of barricade, confirming a change of pace: The EU institutions, and in particular the troika (IMF, ECB and European Commission), must begin to ask themselves where they went wrong and how they can solve the enormous problem they have generated."
"0 They demand before the EU that Spain apologizes for the bombing of Gernika Eurodeputies from PNV, EH Bildu, ERC, PdeCat and Podemos have denounced before the European Commission the Spanish Government's refusal to apologize for the bombing of Gernika. The proposal recalls that on February 8, the Popular Party rejected in the Senate an initiative put forward by the PNV, which called to take advantage of the 80th anniversary of the bombing for the Spanish Government to apologize to the murdered civilian population and acknowledge its responsibility in these events."
0 This is the first time ever that I can recommend a yes to the EU Morten Messerschmidt suddenly finds himself in a situation he has never experienced before: He fervently hopes that the Jasids win a referendum on the EU.He and the Danish People's Party are otherwise known for notoriously agitating for a no vote in all referendums on EU issues.-- but that has changed after British Prime Minister David Cameron announced late Friday that the EU has agreed to a series of changes if Britain stays in the union.
"0 Threat of budget veto: Zoliborz troublemaker blackmails European Union Janusz Lewandowski is a PO MEP, former Minister of Ownership Transformation and EU Commissioner for Budget and Financial Programming.With PiS, sovereign Poland has become self-sufficient in harming itself. This was the case in the pre-partition era and should never be repeated."
"0 Thulesen sees new opportunities in EU agreement The Danish People's Party sees great opportunities to have far greater influence on EU policy in the coming parliamentary term than the party has ever had before. According to the party's chairman, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, yesterday's agreement on EU policy leaves a historically large margin for the Eurosceptic party to conquer EU political land in a number of areas."
"0 Trials of compromise with the EU: Forward to seek a solution BRUSSELSThe M5S-Lega government has tried to lay the groundwork for a compromise with the European Commission, which implements technical control over national budgets and last Wednesday rejected the 2019 maneuver and threatened to ask governments for an infringement procedure for excessive deficit at 2.4% because of the maxi debt at 131% of GDP. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte dined with the Luxembourg president of the Brussels institution, Jean Claude Juncker, clarifying the importance of expansionary spending to boost growth and expressing willingness to reshape some measures."
"0 Two former Freedom Party members want to enter the Lower House with JA21. With JA21 they want to elaborate on the core issues of the Freedom Party: less immigration, less money for climate measures, less EU and participation via referendums.

"0 Under attack from EU sceptic Danish voters have no idea what they are getting when they vote for Morten Messerschmidt (DF). This is the criticism from several sides - not least from the chairman of the Dane's own group in the European Parliament, Nigel Farage."
"0 Valg: Yes to common solutions - no to the EU In the upcoming referendum on replacing Denmark's legal reservation in the EU with an opt-in regime, the Greens are opposed. Together with the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance.-- But unlike the bourgeois no parties, the Greens will participate in a European distribution of refugees."
"0 Vote on Navalny Italy is divided League abstained on Lukashenko In Brussels The bed unmade, two bottles of water on the bedside table. The hotel room in the Siberian town where Alexei Navalny was poisoned had been combed by his colleagues immediately after the news of the malaise of Putin's first opponent."
"0 Vox follows Poland and rejects the primacy of European justice Vox rejects the preeminence of European courts over national courts, one of the foundations of the EU, and proposes recovering judicial sovereignty and proclaiming the primacy of national law over European law in matters affecting the common good of Spain and the general interests of the State. This is the Spanish Agenda presented yesterday by the leader of the party, Santiago Abascal, in the multitudinous meeting that culminated the two days of festivities held at the Madrid fairgrounds under the title Viva 21. Abascal thus joins the ordago launched by Poland against the European Union, which has placed it on a collision course with the Community institutions and has opened an unprecedented crisis since Brexit."
"0 Vox unleashes its most Eurosceptic profile Vox's response to the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on Oriol Junqueras was most belligerent. So much so that it brought out the most Eurosceptic side of the formation, with its leaders denouncing a very serious attack on the sovereignty and the Constitution of Spain and, in parallel, with sympathizers picking up the gauntlet and raising a possible exit from the European Union, making a play on words in English with the term Spexit, mirroring the one used in the United Kingdom with Brexit.Although Vox does not go - at least not yet - to that extreme of raising doubts about remaining in the European Union, it did use the sentence to disqualify the judicial decisions that are slowing down or questioning the work of the Spanish courts in the processes opened against the pro-independence leaders."
"0 Weapons sold by mail order Now the League wants to lift the ban The rule implementing the EU directive ROME Today in the House, in the Constitutional Affairs Committee, an opinion is being voted on a decree implementing a 2017 European directive that affects the approximately 4.5 million Italians who own a firearm. There are six million pieces (hunting, sport shooting, defense, police forces, vigilantes), but the census does not include compressed air guns, the irresponsible use of which (a Roma child was seriously injured in Rome, and a former employee of the Senate was investigated) provoked the reaction of the Head of State, who spoke of barbarism and Far West."
"0 What is 'against' in The Hague is sometimes 'for' in Brussels An anti-European party like the PVV can be expected to seize every opportunity in the European Parliament to reduce EU spending. Yet last November, the PVV euro group did not vote with the majority when it spoke out against the money-consuming commute of parliamentarians between Brussels and Strasbourg.. If you always vote against your own group you are no longer credible"

Yet last November, the PVV euro group did not vote with the majority when it spoke out against the money-losing commute of parliamentarians between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"0 Wilders has his 'proof': The Netherlands can leave the EU The best news in years, the PVV leader calls the report that argues that a 'Nexit' offers a way out of the crisis. Exit from the European Union and the euro is more advantageous for Dutch citizens than remaining muddled in the EU."
"0 Will Hungarians abandon PiS government over EU budget veto? Michal Kokot: Will Hungary really veto the EU budget if the provision linking the payment of EU funds to the rule of law passes?Edit Zgut: In all likelihood, Viktor Orbán will withdraw his veto, while at the same time announcing his great victory at home."
0 Will the Netherlands soon also get a referendum on the EU? Dutch political PVV leader Geert Wilders now wants a referendum on the EU in the Netherlands as well. The middle parties are disappointed with the result.
"0 Will there ever be a Nexit? In the House of Representatives, only the PVV and the Bontes/Van Klaveren group believe that the Netherlands should leave the European Union. Even a euro-critical party like the SP does not want a Nexit and also believes that the British should stay."
0 Worst Roma camp ever The League will take the case to the EU The worst. The worst ever we will bring the case of the Roma camp in Turin before the EU.
0 [ Five arguments The PVV study by Capital E...]* Five arguments The PVV study by Capital Economics gave five reasons for EU exit. Tested the arguments.
"0 [AN] HERMANN TERTSCH 'Number three' of Vox to the European Parliament We want an in-depth reform of the EU Hermann Tertsch (Madrid, 61 years old) has left behind a long career as a journalist and opinionator, which included EL PAÍS, to join Vox, the party he hopes to represent in the European Parliament. In a telephone interview, Tertsch advocates a profound transformation of the EU to curb the work of the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU bloc."
"0 pinpricks Suspending the Schengen treaty would be a colossal nonsense not only from a political point of view (since freedom of movement is one of the constitutive rules of the European Union). Above all, it would be nonsense on a practical level for those political forces, such as the Lega, that blather on about the threat of invasion. So many immigrants who come to us intend to disperse across Europe."
"0 propaganda and reality The rejection by the European Commission is the obvious seal on the manoeuvre of the government formed by the Five Star Movement and the League. Even more than the decision of Brussels, however, the reaction of the yellow-green majority is frightening. To put it briefly: it's unclear whether he doesn't understand what happened, or pretends not to."
"A GOVERNMENT TRAPPED IN THE ELECTORAL RETORIC The Note The question is how it will be possible to seek mediation with Europe, when the conditions are created. The verbal violence between the M5S-Lega governing majority and the institutions in Brussels is such that it foreshadows poisoned relations. If we add to this the attacks even against the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, accused by Vice-Premier Luigi Di Maio of poisoning the climate, there is cause for concern."
"A group in Strasbourg and a congress in November THIS MONDAY, a meeting of the political bureau is to be held behind closed doors at the Front National headquarters in Nanterre. The leaders have two priorities: to decipher the scores in France in order to assess the FN's electoral evolution in the country and to measure the Eurosceptic vote in the European Union in order to detect possible allies. The FN's ambition is to carry weight in the European Parliament."
"A signal to the Brussels Politburo Right-wing populists in Europe see themselves strengthened by the vote. AfD is divided over the consequences When Britain's exit from the EU became clear on Friday morning, jubilation also broke out on the continent - at the headquarters of the right-wing populist parties. From the Front National Chief"
"A writer who no longer wants to be quiet Michael Köhlmeier is a narrative composer with an elephantine memory, noted Die Zeit on the occasion of the publication of his magnificent novel Abendland (2007), which spans an entire century. This elephantine memory of the writer, who was born in 1949 in Hard in Vorarlberg, has now done something again: Köhlmeier recently recalled, when the FPÖ's leading candidate for the EU elections, Andreas Mölzer, once again made use of his inflammatory language (and spoke of the European Union as a Negro conglomerate or compared it to the Third Reich), that the latter himself had once advised him: If you don't like it, then report me! And he has now done so. Köhlmeier will file a class action suit with the public prosecutor's office through SOS Mitmensch next Friday."
"AN EXTREMIS TENTATIVE TO CONVINCE THE COMMISSION The Note The donut to a majority in the balance in relations with the European Commission came from the most unpredictable side: from the France of Emmanuel Macron. Five Star Movement and League, who are scrambling to find a compromise with Brussels on the economic maneuver, now have a very good handhold to negotiate; or at least they think they do. At a time when the French president is announcing measures to quell street protests, sacrificing spending constraints, Italy feels less weak."
"After all, there are often mum-only interviews. The debate on the top tax rate? A lighthouse discussion. Europe? Our greater homeland. Upper Austria's Vice Governor Manfred Haimbuchner (FPÖ) on the EU election, Josef Moser and the papa month.The Press: You recently said about your party, the FPÖ: We clearly position ourselves pro-European. What do you like about Europe?"
"At a glance Majority ratios. Until now, the EU-sceptical camp had 55 MPs (38 FPÖ, 12 BZÖ, 5 Stronach) in the National Council; in future, as things stand, there will only be 53 (42 from the FPÖ, 11 from Stronach). On the other hand, there is a clear two-thirds majority of pro-European MPs."
"At a glance Travel diplomacy in the first weeks of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's term in office is all about Europe. Immediately after his inauguration, Kurz rushed to Brussels, probably not least to underline his government's commitment to the EU despite its coalition with the FPÖ. His first bilateral state visit took him to Paris, on the 17th."
"Austria's new EU role Ttwo weeks after the inauguration of the Turkish-Green government, there is no doubt: the EU Commission, the European Parliament and important partner countries no longer have any reservations about Austria. Since 2017, there have always been such cases because of the EU-sceptical FPÖ, even if this has not been made public. Now the coalition of the ÖVP and the Greens enjoys considerable credit of trust, both in terms of content and personnel."
"Away with Kurz? Pure revanchism on the part of the opposition Kanzler Sebastian Kurz gave us a coalition with the Strache-Kickl-FPÖ and thus the most shameful government imaginable. Certainly, he is closer to some FPÖ contents than his critics and has also made these contents his own for (right-wing) populist reasons (see migration policy or most recently his EU-bashing). To be fair, one should believe that he is opposed to the right-wing extremist burps from FPÖ circles, which have poured down on our country as individual cases on a de facto weekly basis.Now one can, indeed must, criticise Kurz for not having pulled the ripcord long ago in view of these burps."
"Balances played on vagueness to reassure EU and NATO partners Uncertainties and compromises leave their mark in the succinct program of foreign and European policy. It merges continuity with change: the first to reassure partners and allies that Italy remains in its place in the EU and NATO; the second for consistency with electoral promises and, especially on the part of the League, for deep-rooted convictions, favorable to Russia and distrustful of Europe. At first glance, continuity prevails, also due to the effect of the Quirinale's stakes and the external messages of these last few days - no joking with the markets."
"Bipartisan motion Ok of the Senate to a European rating agency The Senate approved by a large majority, with 250 votes in favor, zero against and thirteen abstained, the motion unitary (with the League but without IDV) that commits the government to promote at European level the creation of a rating agency on the securities of sovereign debt. Point B of the approved document (while two other motions by the IDV and one by the League were rejected) commits the executive to support at the EU institutions initiatives aimed at the activation of an independent body which, operating with homogeneous and standardized evaluation criteria, carries out a rating activity on sovereign debt securities and expresses evaluations on the creditworthiness of the individual member countries of the Union. Bipartisan satisfaction."
"Bismarck from Bielefeld One of the most important announcements at the AfD's recent national party conference did not come from the party leadership, nor from the stage, it came from the centre of the room. Marcus Pretzell, regional leader of the AfD in North Rhine-Westphalia and a member of the EU Parliament, lined up at a hall microphone.Before 2400 participants, Pretzell announced that he wanted to switch to the anti-European group in the Strasbourg parliament."
"Blue Block: Supporting parties disappointed by government's EU course There was a great deal of agreement in the Blue Bloc when, during the election campaign, the joint proposal 'Danish welfare in Europe' was launched. It was said that the Left, Conservatives, Danish People's Party and Liberal Alliance had dropped an EU bomb during the election campaign and that they were now forming a common front against welfare tourism.Today, the Left's supporting parties are disappointed."
"Carbon tax at Europe's borders gains consensus PROTECT the environment by taxing... For the others, this is a measure that is almost unanimously supported by the candidates for the European elections. From the Rassemblement National to En Marche!, via Les Républicains, LFI or Debout la France, the carbon tax at the borders appears in many of the programmes of the lists that are running. With parties vying to win the hearts and minds of environmental voters, the carbon tax having been roundly rejected in France, and this being a European election, parties have recycled this old idea - it was first floated by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010. According to a study presented in April by economists Ruben Haalebos (Beyond Ratings) and Paul Malliet (OFCE), the carbon tax at the borders would have consequences on households, via an increase in the prices of imported products."
"Ceta: What investors can and cannot sue for The ratification of the free trade agreement with Canada with the controversial investment court is imminent Vienna For the FPÖ, the matter was still clear last year. Ceta, the free trade agreement between the EU and Canada, restricts the democratic right of self-determination of the states, the liberal economic spokesman Axel Kassegger said in parliament in October. Blue justice spokesperson Harald Stefan warned that the investment protection procedures would put states under pressure vis-à-vis large corporations."
"Chamber still has some hesitations Can you as a political party support the expansion of a mission if you yourself peremptorily disapprove of that mission? That is the dilemma facing the PVV now that the cabinet proposes to crack down on Somali pirates not only when they try to hijack ships, but also to undermine their preparations on land. , We don't want to give legitimacy to a mission under the flag of the European Union, said MP Marcial Hernandez, defense spokesman on behalf of the Party for Freedom. Piracy fighting, he said, should be done exclusively in the NATO context."
"Child cheque causes problems left, right There has been a tradition for decades of the classic governing parties of the Folketing joining forces to take the sweet with the sour in EU policy. In the ten-year VKO-epoch, the Social Democrats and the Radicals provided a permanent, alternative EU political majority for politics outside the union-sceptic DF, which mostly unsuccessfully tried to gain ground in EU politics.Here the supporting party got only sporadic in-flux."
Comment The FPÖ's international world view Detour profitability is not necessarily the word that plays a big role in the language used by FPÖ politicians. That is why the EU net contribution is also readily considered in isolation from participation in the EU internal market. This is why the FPÖ negates the fact that foreign workers contribute both to the country's economic performance and to social security. Thinking and calculating across borders is not the business of a party that would prefer to see the country as an isolated island à la Albania under Enver Hoxha.
"DF to set EU course via referendums On the day that British Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his long-awaited speech on flexible EU cooperation, party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl ( DF) for the first time offers his party's demands for EU policy in a possible coalition with the Left. In Thulesen Dahl's view, it is a poor excuse when the Left uses the Danish People's Party's EU-sceptic line as a reason why the party cannot form part of a bourgeois government. And he sees a clear opening when, after Cameron's speech, the pro-EU parties in Parliament have to acknowledge that flexible EU cooperation is a reality."
"DF withdraws support for government's data law Seven days after the Social Democrats saved the government's burqa ban, the country's main opposition party has once again become the tip of the iceberg. The Danish People's Party will not vote for the government's data protection law, which implements the EU's Data Protection Regulation.That's what Peter Kofod Poulsen (DF) says to Politiken."
"DF: Løkke and Thorning's EU pact seems devious Lars Løkke's (V) close cooperation with Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (S) on future EU policy is arousing criticism in the blue camp. It is a known fact that while both the Left and the Conservatives are in favour of abolishing the legal reservation, the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Alliance are against it. FOLKEAFSTEMNING DF chairman criticizes Lars Løkke for sneaky EU pact with Thorning. LA doubts that Løkke has the courage for a choice on EU reservation."
"DF: Vote no, or we will have asylum quotas Both in Denmark and other countries, Eurosceptic parties use the recent decisions to distribute 160,000 refugees in Europe as an example that the Union's common immigration policy is a dangerous dictatorship. REFUGEES The EU's distribution of refugees shows the danger of common immigration policy, says the Danish People's Party.After the majority of countries agreed to redistribute refugees against the will of four eastern member states, the Hungarian and Slovak governments are considering taking the matter to the EU Court of Justice.Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Romania voted no to the refugee quotas on Tuesday. But the other countries' justice and home affairs ministers agreed by qualified majority to a plan that would initially commit the four countries to accepting more than 6,000 refugees together."
"Debate: FIRST DF THUNKS EU, THEN THEY SAY EU LIES Malte Felske, board member of European Youth Aarhus, Karl Verners Vej 4, Aarhus, and Niels Frederiksen, vice president of European Youth, Boelsmosevej 08, Svendborg: DF frequently criticises the EU for being undemocratic and non-functioning. Here the DF always forgets that the party itself is 'down in the EU' and could itself be the change it wants if the party took responsibility. DF has the most seats of all Danish parties in the European Parliament and is the largest Danish bourgeois party, but DF has achieved nothing significant."
"Discussion of Europe is a conversation between deaf and blind It was a nice contrast, last week. Monday evening a dinner of the European Cultural Foundation and Thursday the presentation of the oh so scientific report of the PVV on the great advantages of a Dutch exit from the EU. However, the conclusion from these two completely opposite meetings is extremely bleak."
"Does the Apple saga mean the end of our on-off love affair with EU? COULD this Apple saga mean the definitive loss of Ireland's 'EU innocence?' Could we see Irish indifference and impatience with Brussels turn to open hostility? Two key 'flip-flop' indicators this week suggest we cannot rule out such a negative development of Europhobia among the Irish people. We saw Fine Gael go to war with the EU Commission, while Sinn Féin took Brussels to its heart.All of that while Ireland stood in as the sandwich meat between the world's biggest company, Apple, and the world's biggest trading bloc, the European Union."
"Dogcatcher! DF in war of words with EU leader The leader of Europe's elected assembly should not come here and claim that he knows anything about Denmark's possibilities in the EU - because he could at most get elected as a dog catcher in Denmark, says the Danish People's Party. --The verdict comes from the DF's EU spokesman, Kenneth Kristensen Berth, who is furious with the President of the European Parliament, the German Social Democrat Martin Schulz.The reason is that Schulz accuses the Danish People's Party of having misled the Danish electorate in the referendum on Europol last year, with the result that the security of Danes is being worsened."
"Draghi's No to new taxes In the program there is the remodeling of rates. Recovery fund, the League says yes to Brussels Tax progressivity, reshaping rates, but without raising taxes. This is the idea of tax reform that the Prime Minister Mario Draghi illustrated to the political forces during the consultations."
"Déjà-vu: All election campaign The twelve weeks until the repeat of the run-off election for the Federal President could be particularly long, subjectively speaking. On Saturday, Red-Green politicians began to take shots at Norbert Hofer and his FPÖ. Reason one: in a press interview on Saturday, Hofer rejected leaving the EU (it would be damaging for Austria to leave). At the same time, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache let it be known via Facebook: If the EU is not prepared to quickly implement reforms towards the citizens, towards democratisation, it will be necessary to increase the pressure."
"EU Citizens' Initiative Gets Unexpected Support Chamber They are not allowed to applaud from the public gallery, but do it anyway. They clap when their frontman Thierry Baudet warns of the creeping transfer of Dutch powers to Brussels. And hands go up at every word of PVV MP Madlener.."
"EU election campaign launched FPÖ and SPÖ critical of ÖVP top candidate Karas Vienna Othmar Karas as the ÖVP's top candidate for the EU election campaign is a challenge not only for the EU-critical coalition partner FPÖ, but also for the opposition SPÖ. Karas was generally praised by the SPÖ, but also warned that he was only a fig leaf for the anti-European policies of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz."
"EU sanctions against Russia are a matter for the bosses Lifting depends on Minsk process Kurz decides, not Kneissl It is high time to end these tiresome sanctions and normalise political and economic relations with Russia , Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache demanded on the weekend via the daily newspaper Österreich. These damaged Austria (the country, note) and drove Russia into the arms of China . It is a big wheel of world politics that the head of the FPÖ is talking about via a tabloid newspaper in Vienna shortly before the start of Austria's EU presidency from 1 January. July is trying to turn around."
"EU summit: Le Pen hopes Visegrad group will bend Franco-German couple Paris (AFP) - Marine Le Pen said Wednesday she hoped the Visegrad group of countries, which take a hard line on immigration, would bend the Franco-German couple at the EU summit that opens Thursday in Brussels. I hope that the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia), Italy and others will manage to make the ideologues, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, see that there are no other reasonable and humane solutions than to stop this massive immigration,"" said the president of the Rassemblement National (RN, formerly FN) in the corridors of the Assembly.I expect tomorrow's European Council to put an end to illegal immigration,"" added Ms Le Pen on the eve of the meeting, against a background of strong divisions among EU countries on the migration issue.Every time there is a crisis, the European Union is totally absent (...)."
"Earning: DF wants to limit foreign students' access to SU It has been a thorn in the side of several parties in Parliament that the European Court of Justice ruled in 2013 that citizens from other EU countries should be able to take a free education with SU if they have at least 10-12 hours of weekly work in this country on the side. The number of EU citizens in Danish educational institutions increased after the judgment. The Danish People's Party now wants to put an end to this development. The party is proposing in the negotiations on the Finance Act to introduce a number of accrual principles for welfare benefits, so that people must have lived in Denmark for the last seven out of eight years to receive the money."
"Europe, a bulwark and an opportunity for France With its sovereignist, anti-elite and anti-globalisation rhetoric, the Front National is in the process of giving credence to the idea that Europe is a harmful project for France. It is not clear what one of the FN's vice-presidents, Florian Philippot, means when he describes the European flag as ""Despite all its faults and mistakes, Europe deserves to be treated with more respect and more distance. It has been so decried for some time that even its proclaimed advocates have been assassinating it without a second thought, like the journalist Jean Quatremer (1)."
"European elections: the pressure shot of Marine Le Pen to Nicolas Dupont-Aignan It was necessary to move the lines. In a letter, published on Thursday 31 May and directly addressed to Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Marine Le Pen proposes him to appear on a common list for the European elections. To her former ally during the presidential campaign, the FN president writes: I therefore propose to meet you as soon as possible in order to work on a common charter that will establish the priorities and essential measures to transform the European Union into a Europe of nations, cooperation and freedom. We have talked a lot in the last few months about the need to bring together national forces for the European elections. It is now necessary to reflect on the concretization of this gathering, explains Nicolas Bay, FN MEP and co-president of the ENL group in the European Parliament, to L'Obs."
"Euroreferendum almost done With 4 days to go, the GeenPeil committee has 85 percent of the 300,000 signatures needed to request a referendum on European support for Ukraine. The committee is seizing the association treaty between Ukraine and the European Union to hold an advisory referendum on EU enlargement. GeenPeil is an initiative of Burgercomité-EU, weblog GeenStijl and Thierry Baudet's Forum for Democracy. They argue that the Dutch government only listens to Brussels anymore."
"Euroscepticism - bell for the new round Two years ago, they still had the wind in their sails. On January 21, 2017, the day after their hero Trump's inauguration in Washington, European nationalists stood on one stage for the first time: Marine Le Pen (Front National), Frauke Petry (AfD), Geert Wilders (PVV) and Matteo Salvini (Lega) - the international of nationalists, ready to take power and free us from the Brussels yoke. With moral support from the Kremlin and the White House."
"Euroskeptics threaten to lose battle for power The winners of the European elections are losing the battle for power. That scenario is becoming increasingly likely for Nigel Farage, leader of the British anti-European party UKIP. He has not succeeded in forming a European political group. PVV leader Wilders and his French companion Marine le Pen (Front National) have not reached that point yet either. And without a group, an MEP is largely sidelined."
"Extreme Right Özcan Akyol Column @ÖzcanAkyol In January, parties such as Front National, Alternative für Deutschland and the PVV met in Koblenz to argue for less power from Brussels and more nationalism. For many progressives, this was a horror: if those clubs had their way, it could just mean the end of a close-knit European Union."
"FF backs SF in bid to reject EU beef deal Call for Government to 'listen' after 84 to 46 defeat A BRUISING defeat was last night inflicted on the Government over the controversial Mercosur beef deal. Fianna Fáil, among others, yesterday supported a Sinn Féin motion which stated that the EU trade deal 'is a bad deal for Ireland and for the planet', calling for its rejection. The Government was ultimately defeated by 84 votes to 46, and while these motions are generally perceived as being non-binding and largely symbolic, the vote has delivered a clear message that most TDs do not agree with the new trade deal."

Background: Because the FPÖ is currently stylising itself on posters as a fighter against the asylum chaos, user Monkeyman wanted to know from her: How exactly would the FPÖ have dealt with the migration flows?

With the BZÖ disappearing, Team Stronach imploding and the Greens aggressively positioning themselves as a pro-EU party, the FPÖ could have a monopoly on EU scepticism , is the analysis of the Freedom Party. A renewed candidacy of Hans-Peter Martin (whose list HPM made 17.7 per cent and three mandates in 2009, later crumbled) is uncertain."

"Farage and SF bedfellows when it comes to Europe One of the longest running fake news stories in Irish politics is the canard that the country is about to be forced into a non-existent European army. Sinn Féin and a variety of other anti-EU campaigners have been proclaiming it since the very first referendum on membership in 1972. That is why Mark Durkan, a Fine Gael candidate for Dublin in tomorrow's election, was right to call out Sinn Féin on its misleading propaganda."

As the responsible federal minister, he took part in the Council meeting of sports ministers, which raised the question in conversation with Austrian correspondents: If the FPÖ calls for limiting the EU to its core competences in view of Brexit, wouldn't this Council formation be one of the first candidates for deletion? Strache does not want to go quite so far as to abolish the Council of Sports Ministers in the spirit of austerity and subsidiarity: True, there is no legislation here, but there is the formation of wills."

Founded under the name Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), it is dominated by Marine Le Pen's French Front National and isolated by all other political groups because of its EU-sceptical course.

"LEGAL BORDERS IN Greece - a country governed by Syriza, sister party of our Podemos - three firefighters from Seville have been arrested while carrying out a humanitarian mission that the Greek government itself considers illegal. However, in Spain, Podemos and other left-wing parties blame the arrest on the European Union, Angela Merkel and the incumbent PP government. Why no reproach is made to the progressive Syriza government? The subject is so ungrateful and politically incorrect, which is why nobody talks about Syriza but about the Hellenic authorities, as if the Tsipras government had nothing to do with the matter.My feelings tell me that the humanitarian mission of the Sevillian firefighters is intrinsically good, but reason urges me to ask myself whether humanitarian missions must necessarily be carried out within the legal frameworks of each country."
"Lars Patrick Berg The MEP says he has been asking himself for a long time how far I can still follow the AfD's path. He said that the election manifesto's demand for Germany to leave the EU prompted him to leave. The 55-year-old calls this foolish, especially as it goes hand in hand with a naïve sympathy for authoritarian systems among some in the AfD. Germany should not forego the many advantages associated with the EU and expose itself to severe economic and strategic uncertainties."
"Laughter Where European member states are tightening their belts to rein in the crisis, the European Commission is simply continuing to increase its own budget. Those who have been shouting out loud from Brussels in recent days about PVV leader Wilders' blowing up of the austerity package to get the Netherlands out of the doldrums cannot defend with dry eyes the almost seven percent increase in this European budget. It is completely incomprehensible that the Europhiles cannot keep their hands to themselves, with the money going on such things as the controversial agricultural subsidies."
"Lavrov in Italy: joint projects to react to sanctions A couple of years ago there was a coup d'état in Gambia, and the U.S. on that occasion declared it illegitimate and in clear violation of international law, but nothing happened, as well as nothing happened in Yemen: it is clear that sanctions on Russia by the U.S. were a way to weaken us and ensure profits, but we have learned to live in the new conditions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov does not miss an opportunity to send messages to Washington, after a long and fruitful meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero, yesterday on the sidelines of the Med Dialog 2018 conference. The circumstance was evoked with regard to sanctions following the Ukrainian crisis, which, in the face of the many points of understanding between Italy and Russia, remain a sore point in bilateral relations (the government contract between Lega and M5S plans to suspend them). Collaborations Sanctions are decided at the level of the European Union - recalled Minister Moavero during a joint press conference following their meeting - and in December the EU heads of government are called to make decisions on the renewal. We - added Moavero - have always considered sanctions not as an end but as an instrument, and it is clear that for a country like ours, with an exporting tradition, the impact is felt."
"League in the EPP? Giorgetti's move: I do not exclude it Alliances in the EU The stone in the pond was thrown by the former Carroccio undersecretary to the Council presidency, Giancarlo Giorgetti: The League in the European People's Party? I would not exclude it a priori. With the Bavarian Csu, for example, there are many elements of consonance, he replied to Lucia Annunziata who interviewed him at Mezz'ora in più. An opening to that Ppe that in Brussels and Strasbourg the League is fighting hard, but which also includes Fidesz, the party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Matteo Salvini's ally, as the Magyar leader defined it in the letter of greetings at the end of the yellow-green government.

"Left: No vote will not change Danish course in the EU Even if today's referendum results in a no vote, Denmark must not give up its ambition to be at the heart of EU cooperation. This is the opinion of the Liberal Party's political spokesman, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen (V), who is thus giving a cold shoulder to the Danish People's Party's ambition to use a possible no vote to get a new European policy agreement in place with a more EU-sceptical approach than hitherto. I find it difficult to find the great European political fraternization from the yes and no sides just today."
"Legal refugees Again! Once again, Germany opens its borders and accepts 10,000 refugees in need of special protection, mainly from Libya, Egypt, Niger, Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia. Resentment is boiling up, and AfD politician Thomas Seitz translates the EU resettlement programme behind the action thus: In German: Vernichtung Deutschlands und Europas durch Umvolkung. Those who are not content with such absurd polemics will welcome the German pledge when they look at the facts. Yes, the policy of open borders and uncontrolled immigration of people who often only want to improve their economic situation was fundamentally wrong."
"Let's think about the euro. The crisis did not destroy it, and Britain's exit from the EU will strengthen the countries using the common currency PiS and other right-wing parties do not even want to hear about the eurozone, considering the adoption of the common currency as the loss of another portion of independence. However, the discussion about Poland adopting the euro is slowly resurfacing."
"Liaison of politics and lies The negation of truth and facts is a trend that is slowly becoming unhealthy Ttwo TV interviews with politicians have recently made waves: the one with Harald Vilimsky, the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU elections, and shortly before that the one with Transport Minister Norbert Hofer (FPÖ) after the truck summit. In both cases, tempers flared over the same question: did politicians publicly tell the untruth here, although they were confronted with proven facts that contradicted their statements? Take Vilimsky, for example: interviewer Armin Wolf asked him if he still wanted the Öxit and to his party friend in the EU Parliament, Marine Le Pen, who wants to break up the EU? Vilimsky saw himself misquoted, brushed aside a clear FPÖ statement on Öxit and said that Le Pen's statements had been mistranslated. No matter what evidence Wolf presented to the contrary, Vilimsky stuck to his truth."

In front of some 800 activists gathered in the theatre of the town held by the RN, the president of the National Rally (RN, ex-FN) blasted the submission (of the government, editor's note) to Brussels and its crazy immigration policy.Today the prefects have only one activity, the settlement of migrants, according to Marine Le Pen who was making her political comeback for the European elections."
"Marine Le Pen is hoping to become the first opponent Paris (AFP) - Marine Le Pen has been quiet since the presidential election and her failed debate against Emmanuel Macron. She will try to re-launch herself on Thursday night in the political show on France 2 and appear as the first opponent of the head of state. In the past few months, the French politician has had to endure a series of setbacks, including a chaotic internal legislative process that was ultimately disappointing, despite the fact that she has eight MPs; the withdrawal from politics of Marion Maréchal-Le Pen and the departure from the FN of Florian Philippot, the two main figures of the FN apart from its president; and the indictment at the end of June in the affair of the European parliamentary assistants And it is his best enemy, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has taken a lead as the first opponent of Emmanuel Macron, when Marine Le Pen has gone off the spectrum, according to the director of the political and opinion department of Harris interactive, Jean-Daniel Lévy, in L'Opinion."

"More taxes for large companies and self-employed and liquidate the labor reform Sánchez presents a program tailored to Podemos that ignores the request from Brussels to adjust 10,000 million euros this year A minimum living income for 720,000 families, liquidate the labor reform and increase taxation for the self-employed and large companies, in addition to a new tax to finance pensions. On the basis of these proposals the PSOE presented yesterday the investiture program of Pedro Sanchez supported by more public spending to secure the essential support of Podemos, just the opposite of what the EU demands. As it is incompatible with the cut demanded by the Commission -10 billion in this year's Budget alone- the Socialists propose to negotiate a new public deficit reduction path."

"NEWS Haselsteiner against Hofer now with dramatic video Hans Peter Haselsteiner continues his campaign against Norbert Hofer. In view of the FPÖ's assertion that it does not want to leave the EU, its No to Öxit campaign now reminds us that the party called for a referendum on leaving the EU as recently as January. The motion was introduced in the National Council after the EU exit referendum."
"Napolitano against the ultra-right On the day in which Meloni, Salvini, Grillo and Casaleggio praise the success of Le Pen Giorgio Napolitano did not exactly draw a parallel between the Nazis and the Eurosceptics, but it was close. He certainly had in his sights the movements of the so-called European ultra-right, first and foremost that of the recent success in France of Marine Le Pen, to which seem to refer in Italy the Lega Nord of Matteo Salvini and the Fratelli d'Italia of Giorgia Meloni (in the perspective of the first phase of the collapse of the system also the M5s of Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio). The President of the Republic, despite his almost 89 years, or rather perhaps because of this, yesterday, at the Fosse Ardeatine for the anniversary of the massacre, with a bold statement has caused the immediate reaction of the old and new right-wing politicians."
"National Council says goodbye to the summer with a marathon Resolutions from the Federal Asylum Office to the Vienna Central Matura - A heated plenary week is in store for the members of the National Council before their summer break: From Wednesday to Friday, there will be more than 30 hours of debates - because there is no shortage of important resolutions, and the FPÖ and BZÖ want to do everything they can to delay the decision on the EU Fiscal Compact (see page 7). This starts with an objection debate against the agenda - because Blue and Orange would prefer to remove the ESM bailout fund and the Fiscal Compact from the agenda."

"New name and alliances Le Pen is inspired by Salvini to refound his Fn A few days after the electoral success of Matteo Salvini, who has been flaunting for years as his dear Italian friend. And a few days before the refounding congress of the Front National, this weekend in Lille, one thing is certain: Marine Le Pen has a craving to find allies, as did the leader of the Northern League. It winks towards the Republicans, the party of the neo-Gollist tradition: for the moment, however, they turn away."
"Nexit vote can be via detour That Nexit referendum is not coming for now. The Tuesday after the Brexit, the House of Representatives rejected by 124 votes to 14 a motion by PVV leader Wilders calling on the government to do everything in its power to hold a referendum on Dutch EU membership as soon as possible .But this rejection does not mean that the Dutch voter will never be able to express an opinion on EU membership. The Chamber has only said that there will not be a referendum in the same way as in the United Kingdom."
"No apology from Mölzer on NS comparison Outrage among SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens Vienna The SPÖ, ÖVP and Greens are outraged by Andreas Mölzer, the FPÖ's top candidate for the EU elections. On the contrary, on Sunday Mölzer once again confirmed his comparison of the Nazi regime with the EU."
"No connection with Europe 'I hope the euro-critical parties win, maybe then something will change' You have had it all with the European Union. Even the participants in the Theorem of the Day who say they will not vote for the highly euro-critical PVV today think that the European Parliament will be better off and also have more influence on EU policy if the skeptics win seats. The fact that the parties that want less Europe are in profit in almost every country in the Union, three-quarters of you label it a good thing."
"No interference on Italy The EU will deal with the new government There has been no interference from Brussels in the ongoing political process in Italy. Margrethe Vestager dismisses as conspiracy theories the accusations addressed to the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella, who according to Lega and M5S would have stopped the Conte government under pressure from the European Union. The Commissioner for Competition - possible candidate of Emmanuel Macron for the post-Juncker - accepts, with some reluctance, to share some thoughts on the Italy case in her colorful office on the tenth floor of the Berlaymont Palace. In the headquarters of the Commission it is a challenge to find someone willing to make official comments: the line decided at the top provides for silence."

"Only a small blue miracle Despite high gains, the FPÖ ended up in third place A blue earthquake is what FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache had hoped for in the EU elections, and with an increase of 7.4 per cent compared to 2009, his party thus managed to get 20.1 per cent of the votes cast. This probably means the largest gain in mandates among the parties; after the election cards have been counted, it is considered highly probable that the FPÖ will gain two more seats in the EU Parliament and thus four mandates. General Herbert Kickl proclaimed the FPÖ as the only party with dynamic growth."

At the opening of the Linz Bruckner Festival on Sunday morning, Minister of Culture Josef Ostermayer (SPÖ) sharply criticised Vienna's FP Club leader Johann Gudenus, saying it was despicable for a high-ranking representative of the FPÖ to dare to insult the EU in Moscow. He accused Gudenus, whom he did not name, of presuming to speak for all Austrians and of using homophobic, discriminatory insults reminiscent of the darkest chapters of our history."
"Own goals from the right Listening to Jörg Meuthen, one could almost feel sorry for Hungary's head of government Viktor Orbán. ""Once again, Hungary is the target of an EU campaign against its sovereignty,"" the AfD leader complained in a speech in the European Parliament on Wednesday. The latest ""pretext"" is the ""Child Protection Act"" that came into force this week, better known outside Hungary as a set of rules against gays, lesbians and other sexual minorities."
"Parliament set to approve post-Brexit WTO quota carve-up THE Parliament is finally set to approve a post-Brexit carve-up of the EU's existing WTO quotas - a move that has been strongly criticised by agriculture MEPs. The agriculture committee's lead MEP on the topic, Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy (left), says the deal hands the European Commission too much power over EU trade policy, at farmers' expense.The carve-up would leave other WTO members with the same level of market access to the EU and UK, combined, as they do now, which has angered countries such as New Zealand, Brazil and the US."
"Philippot says he senses a renunciation of victory in Marine Le Pen Paris (AFP) - Marine Le Pen's former right-hand man, Florian Philippot, says in a forthcoming book that he sensed a renunciation of victory in the 2017 presidential finalist, which he believes explains the evolution of the Rassemblement National (RN, formerly FN). In disagreement with the FN (which became the RN in June), notably on the euro, Florian Philippot left the party in September 2017 to create his own formation, Les Patriotes, which advocates the exit of France from the European Union (Frexit).The exit from the single currency is however no longer a priority for the RN, which validated this new position in July 2017.After her failure in the presidential elections, Marine Le Pen understood that she would never reach the Elysée Palace, writes Florian Philippot in an essay to be published on 19 September (Frexit, published by L'Artilleur)."
"Poles don't want a polexit. But one in three believes in Law and Justice's anti-EU propaganda [SONDAZ] - The EU, where there is a European oligarchy that punishes those who are weaker today and pushes them into a corner, this is not the EU that we entered, and this is not an EU that has a future - Law and Justice claims that the EU acts contrary to the treaties, that bureaucrats from Brussels claim the right to decide on too many issues, that more should be left to member states. - We are not attacking the European Union."
"Poll: Most Poles do not believe in polexit. PiS's policy will not lead to Poland's exit from the EU According to the results of a poll conducted by Kantar for Gazeta Wyborcza, Gazeta.pl and TOK FM, 38% of Poles believe that the EU's exit will not lead to Poland's exit from the EU. Poles are of the opinion that the effect of PiS's policy may be the so-called 'social exclusion'."
"Prelude to the EU Election: FPÖ relies on Karas' replacement The attack on the new coalition partner ÖVP was well-considered, calm, unequivocal and brutal: ""I see Head of Delegation Othmar Karas acting in absolute contradiction to his party,"" said Harald Vilimsky in a Standard interview last week on the sidelines of the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The FPÖ General Secretary is himself an MEP in his second function and, like Karas, is also head of delegation for a total of four Freedom Party MEPs, all of whom are members of the Europe of Nations and Freedom Group (ENF). This group, which currently has 37 mandataries, is not only regarded by the other groups as sceptical of the EU, but also as a rallying point of the far right."
"RN signs 'black book' on EU vaccine strategy The 22 MEPs of the Rassemblement National (RN) have signed a new 'black book', this time criticising the European Commission's vaccine strategy. On some thirty pages, the elected representatives list what they denounce as the failings and ""neo-liberal dogmatism"" of the Union in the ordering of vaccines against Covid-19. ""Never since its creation has the European Union demonstrated its incompetence to such an extent"", attacks the head of the RN delegation in the European Parliament, Jérôme Rivière, who sees in this ""proof by the absurd"" of the dysfunction of the European supranational model.."
"Rarely has a single piece of European cooperation been so obvious for the Danish economy and employment as the agreement on common patent rules and a common patent court. Yet a strange fraternity of Enhedslisten, Dansk Folkeparti and Liberal Alliance will abuse this obvious progress for Danish jobs to tarnish the parties' idiosyncrasies about EU cooperation. POLITICO THINKS Enhedslisten, DF and LA demand a referendum.The result will be a new EU referendum."
"Referendum Column Bert Wagendorp Hurray, sometime early next year we may vote for or against the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. This is thanks to the efforts of the EU Citizens Committee, the Forum for Democracy and GeenPeil, an offspring of GeenStijl. Only when it turns out that too many of the 451,666 collected statements of support are corrupt and campaign leader Jan Roos has submitted his own signature ten thousand times, the referendum will not go ahead."
"Refugees: EU solidarity instead of neo-Biedermeier Am 12. June 1994, Austrians voted to join the EU. Despite a cacophony of counter-arguments from the FPÖ and left-wing nationalist forces, many people, especially younger ones, wanted to participate in the solidarity project of a common Europe. Today, Austria is a self-confident and solidary member state of the European Union, which has not only grown to 28 member states, but is also ready to take the next steps towards integrating the remaining successor states of former Yugoslavia as well as Albania."
"Resistance to weapons ban Four parties do not want to follow EU recommendation Vienna In view of the terrorist threat, a possible ban on almost all semi-automatic firearms, as suggested by the EU Commission, is dividing the parties: Red and Green are in favour of a sales ban, ÖVP, FPÖ, Neos, Team Stronach are against it. The Green Peter Pilz speaks of a Kalashnikov front, Hannes Weninger (SPÖ) of the ÖVP playing around."
Retaliation will be serious if Bern stands firm Three questions about Swiss referendum 'Worrying' EU foreign ministers called the Swiss result Monday. PVV leader Wilders cheered that liberation from the EU yoke had begun in Bern. Three questions on the impact of the referendum.
"Right-wing populist bloc already in danger of falling apart PVV leader Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen of the Front National have only just laid the foundations for a new right-wing populist bloc in the European Parliament or the first cracks are already appearing in the future alliance. The Danish People's Party (DF), which like the PVV is skeptical of the European Union and in favor of stricter immigration rules, announced Thursday that it sees nothing in cooperation with the Front National. 'The Danish People's Party does not like the Front National."
"Rina Ronja Kari: There are crazies in every group French left-wing socialist Jean-Luc Melenchon, a prominent figure in the GUE/NGL group, where People's Movement Against the EU's Rina Ronja Kari also sits, said the other day that he would not support provocations against Russia. Nigel Farage of the Ukip party, which faces a canon election in Britain, chairs the anti-EU EFD group, which also includes Morten Messerschmidt (DF). Both the People's Movement Against the EU and the Danish People's Party distance themselves from support for Russia's president.Farage said in an interview with GQ magazine that Vladimir Putin is the European leader he most admires."
"SCARICABARILE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND EUROPE ON THE MANOVRA The Note If Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is forced to reiterate the untouchability of the single currency for the umpteenth output of a member of the Italian League against the euro, it means that the clash with Europe is at its limit. Also because the formal words of European loyalty on the part of the Five Star Movement and the League, are flanked by others intended to exacerbate the controversy. By now it is clear that in the EU Commission a strategy of zero tolerance towards the Italian government has prevailed. Fiscal maneuver assumptions that include a 2.4 percent deficit-to-GDP ratio are considered an unacceptable threat."

"Salvini opens up to the EU Tria: sanctions can be stopped Tones between Rome and Brussels are softening. Vice-Premier Matteo Salvini leaves open the window with Brussels for the possible downward revision of the ratio between the deficit and GDP. But the leader of the League excludes that the hypothesis is to cut more than 0.2% as had circulated in recent days. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is confident about the sanctions that the EU could impose on Italy: We are discussing, we can still avoid an infringement procedure."
"Salvini-Le Pen and the Freedom Front We will be the black beasts of the historical parties Matteo Salvini weaves the web of the sovereignist network, aiming to enlarge the perimeter that today in the European Parliament is represented by the group Europe of Nations and Freedom. In the front row working on this project is Lorenzo Fontana, for nine years a member of the European Parliament and now Minister for the Family: even yesterday he had numerous meetings in Brussels. The group to which the League belongs was announced in June 2015 by Marine Le Pen, the inspiring ante march that is now ready to open the doors to the new identity movements that have grown exponentially in recent years. Salvini and the leader of the French Rassemblement National talked about this in particular: expanding the boundaries of the populist shock force in order to hit the target of a great electoral affirmation at the European elections in May 2019. The two were the protagonists in the morning of a meeting organized by Ugl secretary Paolo Capone in the national headquarters in Via delle Botteghe Oscure."
"Savona in Strasbourg becomes cautious: I will bring Tajani's doubts to Rome STRASBOURG It is too early to decide whether to accept European reservations on the M5S-Lega government's budget maneuver, which is based on a deficit at 2.4% of GDP far above Brussels' expectations for compliance with EU budget constraints. EU Policies Minister Paolo Savona, considered among the most Euroskeptic in the majority, said this in response to Europarliamentary President Antonio Tajani of Forza Italia, who said he had expressed concerns to him with great clarity last night in a bilateral conversation in Strasbourg."

"Showing the flag to the USA Opposition. The FPÖ, the Greens and the BZÖ speak of an indictment of the EU and see anticipatory obedience to Washington.[VIENNA, apa] Unity between the opposition parties in their harsh criticism of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition in Vienna is truly nothing new."
"Silvio's dinner with Salvini Together out of the euro. Exit the euro and, perhaps, even Europe. During the dinner between Berlusconi and Salvini, the other night in Arcore, the opting out has been hypothesized in earnest, as an extreme gesture to which the agreement between the League and Forza Italia could be pushed, if they win the elections together, as a last desperate revolt, in case the EU remains what it is today: a bureaucratic straitjacket imposed by Germany (Brunetta's definition), without any chance of change. In short, the campaign no euro and no Europe for the moment is far from coming, no one tomorrow will start collecting signatures for a referendum like the British one, which, with the Constitution unchanged, in our country would not even be allowed."
"Sinn Féin rampant THESE EU referendums just keep on giving. Sinn Féin, it appears, has every reason to be grateful for the torturous EU treaty ratification process whose polarising debates have set the Irish political establishment Fine Gael, Labour, and Fianna Fáil again at odds with the national mood, remorselessly feeding the irresistible advance of Sinn Féin. With an historic high in modern times of 24 per cent in today s Irish Times/IpsosMRBI poll (now 2½ times its 2011 election vote) Sinn Féin reaffirms in no uncertain terms its second-party status in the South, albeit leaning very much on its expanding working class base."
"Strache does not pull the foreigner card FPÖ election campaign. After the 500,000 euro campaigns of the SPÖ and ÖVP, the FPÖ leader can be seen on posters from Monday. Thematically, Strache is focusing on EU criticism, at least for the time being.[VIENNA] There was no rhyming this time."
"Strache's man for the rough in Brussels Portrait. Harald Vilimsky, FPÖ General Secretary with a penchant for extremes, will lead the Freedom Party into the EU elections as a dual leader together with Andreas Mölzer.The FPÖ will enter the 2014 EU elections with a dual leadership. Andreas Mölzer, the previous parliamentary group leader in Brussels, has been assigned the role of elder statesman."
"Strache: Karas is the ÖVP's problem FPÖ leader presents Vilimsky as candidate for the Turquoise-Blue government Vienna The FPÖ was the last of the parliamentary parties to present its candidates for the EU elections in May on Tuesday. The Freedom Party list, which was fixed in a party caucus on Monday, is headed by two men."
"Strache: Then an auxit is also possible Interview. The FPÖ leader calls for EU reforms. Should these fail, he argues for Austria to leave the EU."
"Sweden Fraction around PVV and Le Pen becomes extra uncertain: Sweden-Democrats drop out Amsterdam. It has become even more difficult for the PVV and the French Front National to form an anti-EU group in the European Parliament. The far-right Sweden Democrats (SD) party is opting for cooperation with the Danish People's Party and the British UKIP, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson said on Swedish TV yesterday."
"Sánchez stages his turn to the left with a sudden rejection of the EU-Canada agreement The Socialists are getting closer to Podemos and advance that they will go from 'yes' to abstention or 'no' The turn to the left of Pedro Sánchez has already a first practical embodiment. Only one month after having strongly rejected in Congress an amendment to the totality presented by Podemos against CETA, the free trade agreement signed by the European Union and Canada last October 30, the PSOE has changed its position. And through a tweet."
"THE SYNDROME OF THE ASSEDIO TO SKIM THE DIFFICULTY The Note The strategy that emerges more and more each day is that of so many enemies, so much honor. Whether it's the financial markets, the European Union, the UN, the judiciary, even the newspapers, the Five Star Movement and the League are ready to point the accusing finger. In part, it is a natural reflection of an unseen majority, governing for the first time and fearing encirclement."
"TUSK RETURNS TO END THE KACZYNSKI ERA The agent of Germany, as the Polish government party Law and Justice (PiS) refers to the former president of the European Council Donald Tusk, returns to national politics and resumes the leadership of the opposition Civic Platform (PO) in view of the 2023 general elections. The confirmation yesterday of the return of the liberal Tusk to the political arena did not alter the congress held in parallel by the PiS behind closed doors to confirm Jaroslav Kaczynski as leader and designate heir.Poland's strongman, re-elected in an uncontested vote and 72 years old, plans to retire in four years, once the next legislature begins and he verifies that the Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, whom he has implicitly designated as his successor by raising him to the vice-presidency of the party, is capable of continuing his legacy.The road is marked out for him, and the one that runs between Warsaw and Brussels, in case there is any doubt about a change of course with the arrival of European funds for reconstruction, was underlined in black and white on Friday. It was with a document signed in different European capitals by leaders of hard right parties denouncing the ideological monopoly of the European Union.In that manifesto, Kaczynski, Giorgia Meloni (Brothers of Italy), Santiago Abascal (VOX), Viktor Orban (Fidesz), Mateo Salvini (League) and Marine le Pen (RN) and leaders of nationalist and far-right parties from Bulgaria, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Romania, demanded that cooperation with European nations must be based on tradition, respect for the culture and history of states, respect for the Judeo-Christian heritage and the defense, not the destruction, of the values that unite our nations.It is the first time that Kaczynski aligns himself with Le Pen and Salvini, whom he sees as too close to Russia, his worst enemy. So is Orban, but PiS has looked the other way in this case because Hungary and Poland are members of the so-called Visegrad group, because it needs allies in the European Council and because both practice illiberal democracy, with attacks on the rule of law and freedoms.Tusk's return fits into that context."
"Taoiseach defends approach to Brexit Assurances on Border and peace process are not 'soft' but binding, Dáil told Taoiseach He also denied claims that assurances to the Government on Ireland and Northern Ireland's position were soft. Mr Kenny rejected claims by Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald that the EU negotiating document dealing with the North and the peace process is vague and conditional. She said the Government had to act immediately to ensure the North gets special designated status within the EU."
"That's what you get when you call the people stupid, which Alexander Pechtold did, after all, with his statement that Europe is too complicated to cram into a referendum: then the people, if given the opportunity, stick their tongues out at you en masse. A partnership of GeenStijl, the EU Citizens Committee and the Forum for Democracy called GeenPeil into existence. The start of this initiative to achieve an anti-EU referendum was so hesitant that the organizers themselves thought for a long time that they would not reach the required 300,000 statements of support partly due to the lack of publicity support from the traditional media."
"The ""Euro-reformism"", new doctrine of the party It is probably one of the most visible changes in the doctrine of the Front since the announcement of the total refoundation of the party by Marine Le Pen, the day after her defeat in the presidential election. A supporter of the ""Frexit"" and the dismantling of the European Union, the Front National has made a 180 degree turn since the departure of Florian Philippot, and now proposes the new concept of ""Euro-reformism"".. At the"
"The EU Commission's plan to increase the size of the EU border protection agency Frontex to 10,000 men by 2020 has been delayed for years. In the talks so far, we have seen that the EU Commission's target of fixed figures by 2020 is actually beyond the scope of what is feasible,"" said the current EU Council President and Interior Minister Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) in Brussels. That is why we are now in the process of exploring appropriate compromises, and we will try to reach a compromise by 31 December."
"The EU Parliament is only important for one in two For a quarter an unnecessary institution Survey shows much scepticism before European elections Linz 25 per cent of domestic voters consider the EU Parliament to be an unnecessary institution, and around 40 per cent of FPÖ voters think so. This is the result of a recent survey by the Linz-based Market Institute for the STANDARD."
"The EU, the Dáil and Mercosur deal Sir, - I take issue with the article Spineless Dáil exposed by its rejection of trade deal (Opinion & Analysis, July 20th). Stephen Collins writes that the democratic vote which was taken by the majority of Dáil members on July 11th to reject the EU-Mercosur deal, through a Sinn Féin-led private member's motion, came about as a result of an uninformed decision on free trade and that it bodes badly for serious looming challenges. It is obvious from the article that your columnist places prosperity and international free trade above all, despite the fact that Ireland has recently declared a climate emergency."
"The European Union wants immigration, according to Marine Le Pen Paris (AFP) - The European Union wants immigration and EU countries, divided on the issue, cannot agree at the summit on Thursday and Friday, Marine Le Pen said Monday. The European Union wants immigration, it has said so on several occasions through the intermediary and mouths of many of its European commissioners, to counterbalance the decline in the birth rate, to weigh down in reality on salaries and create competitiveness, the president of the National Rally (RN, ex-FN) said on franceinfo.As a result, the 2017 presidential finalist believes that the EU countries, divided over the reception of migrants, cannot reach an agreement at the summit on Thursday and Friday.The EU is immigrationist."
"The FN scenario for ending the single currency Concerted exit Jean Messiha is confident that the Germans, Italians and Spaniards would be ready to make concessions at the extraordinary European summit, which would be organised a few days after the election of the FN candidate as president. In this case, in the FN's plans, the exit from the single currency would be concerted with our neighbours, with negotiations lasting six months."
"The Government supports additional measures to the labor reform The warnings from Brussels about the need to complete the labor reform and make further adjustments have entered the campaign and were the focus of part of the second debate between the candidates to La Moncloa, after the one in EL PAÍS. In the morning, the Government supported the EU's additional measures, which are opposed by PSOE and Podemos. In the face-to-face, all rejected further cuts."
"The Government supports additional measures to the labor reform Warnings from Brussels about the need to complete the labor reform and make further adjustments have entered the campaign. The Government assured yesterday that it supports the additional measures in labor matters demanded by Europe, but resists the adjustments, while the PSOE assured that it will renegotiate the whole economic policy with the EU. Ciudadanos agrees with the European Commission and Podemos denies its warnings.Pages"
"The Law and Justice party and the EU issue It is not a coincidence that Krystyna Pawlowicz's words about EU rag were not condemned by anyone in the Law and Justice party, that EU flags were brought out from the Prime Minister's office, and that a parliamentary team was formed to evaluate the results of our membership in the EU. PiS is treating the EU like a hegemon that is stomping on our sovereignty. We know this discourse from Radio Maryja and from nationalist football fans' rallies where one chants: Yesterday Moscow, today Brussels!."
"The LuxLeaks scandal unites the Eurosceptics by Ivo Caizzi The attempt to coalesce the Eurosceptic components of the Europarliament, promoted by the MEPs of Beppe Grillo's M5S, is successful. The adhesion of the Ukip of the British Nigel Farage, the Front National of the French Marine Le Pen and the League of Matteo Salvini has allowed the Pentastellati to find the minimum of 76 MEPs necessary to vote on a motion of censure against the President of the European Commission, the Luxembourger Jean Claude Juncker, involved in the international LuxLeaks scandal (as Prime Minister he was the godfather of the development of the Grand Duchy as a tax haven with strict banking secrecy). Juncker is expected in the Strasbourg Euro Parliament today for a debate ahead of the vote on the censure motion, which is scheduled for next Thursday."
"The National Front's future European alliances Whatever its place on the podium of the European elections on 25 May, the National Front will take advantage of its political weight to forge alliances with other European eurosceptic formations. Ludovic de Danne, European affairs adviser to the FN To build its alliances, the FN works on two levels. It builds bilateral relations directly with partner parties (PVV in the Netherlands or the Northern League in Italy) and relies in parallel on the European Alliance of Liberties (EAL), the party chaired by Austrian Franz Obermayr of the FPÃ-."
"The Netherlands could do with some sovereignty Sovereignty must be a precious commodity, because no one wants to lose it. According to the PVV, we have already lost far too much sovereignty to Brussels. According to the SP, not an ounce of sovereignty should be given away anymore, and when Prime Minister Rutte returns from Brussels, he tells us that all sorts of things have happened, but one thing has not: no sovereignty has been ceded."
"The cooperation of the actors wants to set the pace Iin essence, it was nothing entirely new, and there was no talk of a breakthrough at the informal meeting of EU interior ministers in Innsbruck on Thursday, but EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos praised the talks with the government representatives with words of praise: ""The day turned out much better than I would have expected. Host Herbert Kickl (FPÖ) was pleased about the consensus to actually and concretely advance the protection of the EU's external borders. The focus is on the border management agency Frontex: it is to be further strengthened with a shared mandate. This means that Frontex should not be a substitute for national obligations."
"The copycat Already on day 1 of Brexit, the chief operators of the exit from the EU had to admit that they lied to the British people. This charlatanry is what the almost-Federal President Norbert Hofer of the FPÖ now wants to do to Austria Hofer said that if the EU has not changed in some way within a year, we will have to ask the Austrians whether they still want to be members here. Hofer voted against EU membership at the time and would do so again. With his current announcement he is in line with all the right-wing extremists in Europe (recently, he has been in contact withOn day one of the Brexit, the chief operators of the exit from the EU had to admit that they lied to the British people."
"The decisions of Stuttgart EU and Euro: The EU is to return a large part of its previous competences to the nation states. If this change in the EU cannot be realised, the AfD will seek Germany's withdrawal or a democratic dissolution of the European Union and the re-establishment of a European Economic Community. The AfD demands an orderly end to the euro experiment."
"The euro, a shield for the yellow waistcoat crisis The euro celebrated its 20th anniversary on 1 January. Today, it is no longer a subject of political debate and even the 'populist' parties have put the exit from the European single currency at the bottom of their programme, like the Rassemblement National in France, the Five Star Movement in Italy, or the Freedom Party in Austria. It must be said that leaving the euro has become a powerful deterrent since 64% of eurozone citizens are attached to it, with only 25% wanting to leave it (Eurobarometer survey)."
"The event is presented by the leaders of the Rassemblement National (ex-Front National) as the pivotal moment of the far-right party's campaign for the European elections. Some have been talking about it for weeks: at the end of March, a joint meeting of European nationalist formations will be held in Milan (Italy). On this occasion, the alliance between Matteo Salvini's League and Marine Le Pen's RN is supposed to give birth to the outlines of a ""grand coalition"" of sovereignists in the European Parliament after the elections on 26 May. Dreamt up by the two political leaders, this would consist of the reunion of Eurosceptics, until now dispersed in three groups in Strasbourg (ECR, EFDD, ENL), in a new single group, the largest possible."
"The new austerity club is eager, but interacting There is a new strong axis in Danish politics, which is characterised by a number of converging interests, strong political competition and great mutual distrust. Whether it is about new tightening of immigration policy or Denmark's relationship with the EU, the decisive political game is currently between the Left, the Social Democrats and the Danish People's Party, which constantly relate to each other to such an extent that the other parties are pushed into supporting roles.The past week has shown the so-called SOV triad to be an unstable mix."
"The passionless pro-Europeans The silence of a ruling class The only ones who speak passionately about Europe are Europe's enemies. This is demonstrated by the French local elections, and the success of Marine Le Pen; the jubilation of the League; the autonomist referendum (poll?) in Veneto; Beppe Grillo's interview and his upcoming electoral tour (for a fee), Te la do io l'Europa. The paradox is explainable."
"The playground of the angry Bernd Lucke had at times managed to put concerns about Europe into words without being resentful. His gifts were not enough to keep the AfD on this course An often-used paradox: thanks to the Greek Rustic drama, the European Union is really not looking good at the moment - but at this very moment, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) literally has nothing to say on this issue that is strongly moving the public. What's more, there doesn't seem to be anyone in the party who is hurt by this, who is concerned about the issue and who would like to say something about the euro."
"Thousands at Demo in Vienna Protest We Have Space for Refugee Reception Vienna Kurz, Nehammer and the FPÖ are the arsonists. Down with the borders, we have room stood on one, EU policy kills and open borders. Moria close on two other signs held aloft at a demonstration in Vienna on Saturday afternoon."
"Together against Europe It is anti-European forces that have kicked off the campaign for the European parliamentary elections next May. Suddenly there, last Monday, was a tweet from PVV leader Geert Wilders. ,,Just had lunch with Marine Le Pen in Paris. Impressive woman."
"VKO scolding Van Rompuy Herman Van Rompuy was once a bourgeois finance minister and later prime minister of Belgium. But among the bourgeois parties in this country, there is little understanding for the views of the incumbent EU president on child benefit and other social benefits for immigrant EU citizens.Sharp is the criticism from the Danish People's Party, but both the Left and the Conservatives also reject Van Rompuy's accusation that the debate has been blown out of proportion. The bourgeois parties in Denmark reject Herman Van Rompuy: There is a problem with social benefits for EU citizens."
"View from Copenhagen: Who's to blame? If Denmark fails to reach a parallel agreement with the EU on Europol police cooperation this autumn, it will trigger a vicious political row that will not make it any easier for the 'yes' and 'no' parties to agree on the new referendum, which is the announced fallback solution. The Danish People's Party may be pressured to support a possible new EU referendum on Europol cooperation, even though the party hardly wants to.The case has become a dispute about voter fraud."
"Vistisen: First we want to reform the system If the Danish People's Party has its way, companies will have to scour the labour market for Danish citizens before they are allowed to hire a foreigner. Even from EU countries, says DF's EU parliamentarian Anders Vistisen. How do you find a system to organise the labour market in this completely new way? Basically, we think it should be like this: Before you can go abroad, you should ask the relevant trade union and the relevant job placement office in the municipality where you are located whether you can get the labour within the unemployed that exists in Denmark, before we give permission to import people from outside, says Anders Vistisen."
"Voting is simple, choosing not The Hague. The unconditionally pro-European line of D66? The harsh anti-EU rhetoric of the PVV? Or rather the nuanced 'Europe yes, but in moderation' sound of VVD, PvdA or CDA?Tomorrow the Netherlands will vote for the fifth time in four years."
"Vox unleashes its most Eurosceptic profile Vox's response to the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on Oriol Junqueras was most belligerent. So much so that it brought out the most Eurosceptic side of the formation, with its leaders denouncing a very serious attack on the sovereignty and the Constitution of Spain and, in parallel, with sympathizers picking up the gauntlet and raising a possible exit from the European Union, making a play on words in English with the term Spexit, mirroring the one used in the United Kingdom with Brexit.Although Vox does not go - at least not yet - to that extreme of raising doubts about remaining in the European Union, it did use the sentence to disqualify the judicial decisions that are slowing down or questioning the work of the Spanish courts in the processes opened against the pro-independence leaders. And to present these rulings as an interference and an absolute affront of foreign institutions in what is Spain."
"Waszczykowski put out the fire, but will it last? The head of Polish diplomacy made a good impression in Washington. He speaks in a balanced way, argues logically, and is not aggressive toward Russia or PiS critics of the EU. He speaks English confidently and seems knowledgeable."
"We are not the country of cheerful finance Tria at the Eurogroup. Vice-Premier Salvini: Italy won't vote on EU budget if it hurts us Conte on Saturday in Brussels for a dinner with Commission President Juncker BrusselsThe M5S-Lega government does not intend to change the 2019 maneuver, which was rejected by the European Commission for the deficit at 2.4% of GDP, and has reservations about the project of the Franco-German axis of the euro zone budget as on other reforms of the monetary union. But in the Eurogroup of finance ministers in Brussels, the head of the economy, Giovanni Tria, expressed this line in a dialoguing manner, leaving room for compromise with the EU institutions."
"Welcome Viktor Orbán with open arms Interview. Harald Vilimsky, the FPÖ's top candidate in the European elections, rules out an Austrian exit from the EU - for the time being - accuses George Soros of interference and pleads for equidistance between Russia and the USA.The Press: Can you rule out making the case for Austria's EU exit again?"
"Who knows, maybe I will become a writer interview. The EU is questioning Hungary's sovereignty, criticises FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache. After the next election, he wants to become chancellor."
"Wilders asks and gets anti-EU piece: Without Brussels we really are better off Geert Wilders' position on the European Union is well known and he has now ordered a report to go with it. Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem reacted laconically yesterday to the appearance of the PVV-requested study on 'NExit' - the Netherlands' departure from the EU.
