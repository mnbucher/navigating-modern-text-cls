"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Just hours before the unemployment benefits fund was to run out in South Carolina, the state with the nation’s third-highest jobless rate, .,Gov. Mark Sanford relented .Wednesday and agreed to apply ,fpr a $146 million federal loan to shore it up, after weeks of refusing to do so."
"„ The governor's position had drawn rebukes even from fellow Republicans in the Legislature, one of whom denounced Mr. Sanford, as “heartless,” and from Newspaper editorial pages. On Wednesday, The State, the daily inewspaper here in Columbia, accused the governor of playing ,'jchicken with the lives of the 77,000” who are unemployed in .South Carolina. ."
"For weeks, Mr. Sanford, pewly .elected as head of the Republican Governors Association and iknown for being a fierce free-[Riarket foe of govern."" ant spending, stuck to his stand, questioning the probity of the South Caro-Jina Employment Security Com-itnission and demanding a new audit of the agency."
"» He has said in the past that he did not trust the commission’s calculation of the state’s unemployment rate, though a spokesman at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was calculated the same way as in every other state. !•; Mr. Sanford is now demanding that South Carolina’s Commerce Department, whose director ho ^appoints, be given access to .the .state unemployment agency’s Slumbers, including where applicants are from, their ages, genders and occupations."
"The back-and-forth dueling between the conservative governor (and the unemployment agency ;Jias gone on for weeks, and its executive director, Roosevelt T. Jfalley, warned that he would jiave to stop issuing benefit ; checks to the jobless beginning Jan. 1 if Mr. Sanford did not back down and ask the federal government for the loan."
"The steel industry, having entered the recession in the best of health, is emerging as a leading indicator of what lies ahead. As steel production goes — and it is now in collapse — so will go the national economy."
"That maxim once applied to Detroit’s Big Three car companies, when they dominated American manufacturing. Now they are losing ground in good times and bad, and steel has re- • placed autos as the industry to watch for an early sign that a severe recession is beginning to lift."
"The industry itself is turning to government for orders that, until the September collapse, had come from manufacturers and builders. Its executives are waiting anxiously for details of President-elect Barack Obama’s stimulus plan, and adding their voices to pleas for a huge public investment program — up to $1 trillion over two years — intended to lift demand for steel to build highways, bridges, electric power ., grids, schools, hospitals, water treatment plants and rapid transit ,	."
"“What we are asking,” said Daniel R. DiMicco, chairman and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a giant steel maker, ""is that our government deal with the worst economic slowdown in our lifetime through a recovery program that has in every provision a'buy America’clause.”"
"WASHINGTON - Presidentelect Barack Obama's economic recovery plan ran into crossfire from His own party in Congress on Thursday, suggesting that quick passage of spending programs and tax cuts could require more time and negotiation than Democrats once'nop ed."
Senate Democrats complained that major components of his plan were not bold enough and urged more focus on creating jobs and rebuilding the nation’s energy infrastructure rather than cutting taxes.
"Just hours earlier, Mr. Obama called for speedy passage of the stimulus measure, Warning that the recession “could linger for years” if Congress did not pass his plan within weeks."
"Further complicating the picture, Democratic senators said Thursday that they would try to attach legislation to the package that would allow bankruptcy courts to modify home loans, a move Republicans have opposed. [Page Bi.] ulus plan, the Obama team has also been considering how to use the second $350 billion of the bailout program approved by Congress. A transition team official said Thursday night that the new approach would give government officials broader range to provide relief on consumer loans for homes, automobiles and education, while also doing more to address foreclosures and the problems of municipalities and small businesses."
"S-For his recovery plan, meanwhile, Mr. Obama has been assembling a package worth as ftnuch as $775 billion over two years to revive the sagging economy, using the plan to define his presidency even before it begins |ind to foreshadow his broader approach to governing, r While relying on traditionally liberal notions of using government spending to spur growth, he has also tried to adapt it for a new era with investment in clean energy and technology. And he is trying to balance all of that with tax breaks that appeal to Republicans."

"Plummeting tax and fare revenues that have been depressed further by the ailing economy could increase the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s budget deficit this year by $650 million, according to a new estimate made public on Monday. If the doomsday forecast is borne out, the authority’s deficit this year could grow to nearly $2 billion."
"The authority has already proposed a steep increase in fares and deep service cuts if it does not get a state bailout. But if its finances worsen significantly, it could be forced to take even more drastic measures."
"“This is obviously breathtaking,” Gary Dellaverson, the authority’s chief financial officer, said as he presented the projections to a meeting of the authority board’s finance committee."
"Transit officials also said that average weekday subway ridership declined 2 percent in January compared with the same month last year, probably because of shrinking employment in the region. It was the first time that that measure of subway ridership had fallen since 2003, except in months where the drop was attributed to bad weather or quirks of the calendar, like holidays falling on weekdays."
"Lower ridership also means less money collected in fares, worsening the authority’s fiscal straits. In January, the subway system recorded an average of"
"WASHINGTON - Even as they continued to hash out the details of a nearly S800 billion economic recovery plan, aides to President-elect Barack Obama on Sunday began lobbying a reluctant Congress to release the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund."
"The request is certain to generate angry debate on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are reeling from last week’s projection of a $1.2 trillion budget deficit and will also soon be asked to vote on Mr. Obama's $800 billion recovery package."
WASHINGTON — The rising unemployment rate is giving President Obama’s critics an opportunity to raise questions about the effectiveness of his recovery plan and his economic leadership. The huge budget def-h icit is focusing fresh concern on J:tne national aeui.
"D A little less than four months -after he signed the $787 billion ,, American Recovery and Re-j! investment Act into law, Mr. Oba-i,ma is now in the position of try-j ing to convince Americans that the stimulus measure — his sig-,, nature legislative achievement „thus far — is working, even as the job losses mount."

"MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s economy is being dragged down by the recession to the north. American addicts have turned Mexico into a drug superhighway, and its police and soldiers are under assault from American guns. Nafta promised 15 years ago that Mexican- trucks would, be allowed on American roads, but Congress said they were unsafe."
"other side as well. Many American communities are worried about drug violence spilling over the border, and about Mexican immigrants taking scarce jobs. That is forcing the Obama administration, already managing two wars and a deep recession, to fashion a new Mexico policy earlier than it might have wished."
"The 67-acre development on the Strip consists of six towers with 2,392 apartments, as many as 5,900 hotel rooms, a casino, and a shopping center and entertainment complex. Some of the world’s renowned architects have designed buildings for the project. Envisioned as a self-contained community, it will have its own fire department and power plant."
"Because of the credit crisis, City-Center’s owners found themselves in September 2008 unable to obtain several billion dollars that they had anticipated in loans from a consortium led by Bank of America. Though a $1.8 billion loan was eventually offered, the owners had to finance much of the project with their own cash. They had almost finished five towers when new problems erupted in February."
"III,the recession, the nation’s poverty, rate climbed to 13.2 percent,last year, up from 12.5 per-cent;in,2007, according to an annual report released Thursday by the .Census Bureau. The report also,documented a decline in employer-provided health insurance and in coverage for adults."

"""This is the largest decline in the first year of a recession we’ve seen since the Census Bureau started collecting data after World War II,"" said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, referring to household incomes. ""We’ve seen a lost decade for the typical American family.” The share of American resi-, dents who said they lacked health insurance throughout the entire year remained steady, at 15.4 percent, or 46.3 million people. But the total masked some more worrisome trends that are helping to drive the debate over a national health care overhaul."

"The economy shrank at an accelerating pace late last year, the government reported on Friday, adding to the urgency of a stimulus package capable of bringing the country back from a recession that appears to be deepening."
"The actual decline in the gross domestic product — at a 3.8 percent annual rate — fell short of the 5 to 6 percent that most economists had expected for the fourth quarter. But that was because consumption collapsed so quickly that goods piled up in inventory, unsold but counted as part of the nation’s output."
"“The drop in spending was so fast, so rapid, that production could not.be cut fast enough,” said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at IHS Global Insight. ""That is happening now, and the contraction in the current quarter, as a result, will probably exceed 5 percent."""
"The dismal fourth quarter, and the likelihood of more of the same through the spring, are fueling discussion among policy makers and politicians over the best way to spend the soon-to-be-authorized federal money."
"6.2	percent, with universities pulling in a total of $31.6 billion, the highest amount ever recorded, according to the survey."
"BOSTON — Scores of legal aid societies that help poor people with noncriminal cases — like disputes over foreclosures, evictions and eligibility for unemployment benefits — are being forced to cut their staffs and services, even as requests for help have soared."
"In an odd twist, the societies have been hit hard by the Federal Reserve's steep reduction of its benchmark interest rate, which finally plunged last month to near zero."
"The rate decline, though generally welcomed as a blow against the recession, has had an unplanned and severe effect on legal aid societies, which depend heavily on revenues that are tied to the federal funds rate. As recently as 2007, the rate was more than 5 percent and legal aid agencies reaped more than $200 million for their operations."
"Now, for many legal aid groups across the country, cutbacks in staffing are expected to reach 20 percent or more over the coming months, even as requests for their services have risen by 30 percenter more."
"low-wage workers’ salaries commensurate with the cost of living, voters approved a change to the State Constitution that requires the minimum wage to be adjusted with inflation. As a result of the change, the minimum wage in Colorado has risen along with the cost of living. But this is the first time officials are faced with the prospect of lowering the wage to keep pace with a faltering economy. The federal minimum wage is S7.25 an hour, and it is illegal for most businesses in Colorado to pay workers less than that, so virtually all low-wage workers will see a drop of only 3 cents per hour. But advocates for poor Coloradoans say even that slight drop is enough to hurt people."

Yesterday, however, lack of early pressure combined with the successful “riding out"" of the critical lunch hour to invite fresh bidding in the late afternoon.

"One of the most controversial measures to be considered at the I recent session of the Legislature, the bill had been fought by both the State Federation of Labor and the State Congress of Industrial Organizations. They contended it would weaken the unemployment insurance fund, which is used to pay benefits to jobless workmen, and that it unduly favored larger business establishments."
The Young-Demo bill was virtually the only piece of major legislation on which Governor Dewey took no stand when it was before the Legislature. Its fate was uncertain until his approval of it was announced today. Mr. Dewey gave no reasons for his decision.

So said James L.

"Mr. Rogers said that Attorney General Tom Clark in a recent address ""gave high praise for the drug industries’ success in holding prices down. He reported a price increase of 3.1 per cent on 7,000 drug store items during the period, 1939 to 1947.” Mr. Rogers also urged the manufacturers to ‘ continue to do research to the greatest possible extent and support all worthwhile research organizations in our field” in order that the drug industry may remain on its present high plane and come to ‘‘greater heights of usefulness and service ;al care under Government control far below the general average that prevails in the United States.

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1—President Trumap was urged today in a report of his Council of Economic Advisers to seek renewal of some war-time powers to deal with a threatened inflation of industrial prices under the combined impact of heavy domestic demand and a $20,000,000,000 European recovery program."
The report warned that serious inflation already existed in prices of food and steel. It said the nation’s ability to support a European recovery program of the proportions contemplated already had been demonstrated but warned of serious trouble ahead unless “firm measures” were taken to counteract current trends.
On receipt of the report. President Truman issued a public statement calling attention to the fact that it and the report on national resources and foreign aid by the Secretary of Interior Julius A. Krug found that the United States had the resources and economic and financial capacity to support a considerable European aid program.
"Mr. Truman said these reports and other pertinent material would be the basis for his recommendations to Congress. Today, again, Mr. Truman limited his callers to a minimum and continued his work on the message to the session of Congress opening on Nov. 17. In this message he will outline a program for checking inflation and aiding Europe."
Strategists of both parties saw as one aim of the President's proposals to combat the inflationary spiral a gesture to mollify the rebellious leftist fringe within the Democratic party that has been flirting with the idea of a third party. It was thought that a particular concession was made by the President in asking for the imposition of price controls on items in scarce supply.
"For the Republicans, Carroll Reece, national chairman of the party, asked what had made the President change his mind about the need for price controls."

"The imposition of wartime controls upon a peacetime economy would “go far to upset our economy” and would continue a state of scarcity, Morris Sayre, the NAM president told the Senate Banking Committee, conducting hearings on a number of anti-inflation bills."
"On the other hand, John Middle-kamp, appearing for the Automobile Manufacturers Association and as a spokesman for the automotive industry, described controls as “a boomerang in the battle against inflation” and held controls would only impede production, increase price and foster inflation."
"Industry’s anti-inflation program, Mr. Sayre told the committee, calls for reduction of government spending and taxing, and systematic retirement of the public debt. Labor is asked to forego demands for further general wage increases without corresponding i increases in productivity and to set aside all featherbedding rules and unnecessary restrictions on individual productivity."
"Reading in THE Times of Jan. 1 th« New Year’s message of Treasury Secretary John W. Snyder that individual' saving is America’s “most potent weapon in combating inflation,” r found' myself intrigued but nonplused. For I; knew that today, with an insurance premium, several bills, and an income-tax installment coming due, I would have to draw upon what savings I had already accumulated. This morning, for the third time in six months, I took several war bonds from the safety-, deposit box and sold them across .the counter.	__"
"There are, to he sure, many persons whose income has greatly increased since Pearl Harbor and who are even-embarrassed by surplus funds. These may well heed Mr. Snyder’s injunction to save. But the Secretary overlooks the salaried professional man who fi£s spent much time and money in preparation for an expert vocation and’is grievously hit by inflated prices."
"With a salary which was adequate when Mr. Snyder took office and which has increased slightly since then, I, as a teacher, am now unable to make ends meet decently without using my savings. Our family of five live respectably but frugally, denying ourselves certain amenities which we took as normal a few years ago. My wife and I seek to hear our own weight and maintain insurance and annunity provisions sufficient to educate our children and provide for our old age without appeal to either charity or public relief funds. We consider this course indispensable to the true American tradition, but it is touch and go as to whether we can continue it."
"Many in the teaching profession are less fortunate. Some, for purely financial reasons, have had to leave college or university faculties to enter business or government. We wonder whether our fellow-citizens realize the toll which inflation has already taken from many persons and institutions whose distinctive contributions our country and the world definitely need.	“"
"Since last week two of the staples on today’s shopping list have gone up 10 per cent, an increase greater than that made by my bonds in the four years in which I had treasured them. I wonder where to find the individual savings which Mr. Snyder asked me to put aside to beat inflation."

"If the rest of the steel industry institutes lower prices to the same degree as United States Steel, the nation’s steel bill will be lowered by $75,000,000 to $100,000,000 an-: nually, according to one industry official. Big steel’s reductions, which become effective on May l,j amounted td $25,000,000."
"The Bethlehem, in a statement issued here by E. G. Grace, chairman, said that its price reductions would amount to $10,000,000 on an annual basis, but, like United States Steel, it did not report the specific reductions on the product involved. Jones & Laughlin and Youngstown Sheet and Tube did; not place a value on the reductions, I contemplated."
"“This is the first attempt of any union in this area to assist its members in combating high prices,” Mr. Annable said. He said further, that if successful, the local would introduce “many other necessities” to help meet today's increased living costs."
"WASHINGTON. July 30—President 'Truman continued today his demands on Congress for curbs against inflation, warning that avoidance of a “business collapse,” which he foresaw without his program, was prerequisite to a peaceful world."
"Mr. Truman was markedly more temperate in tone than in the message he personally delivered to Congress Tuesday, but the sense of economic urgency with which he viewed the “growing threats to our well-being” Was no less apparent."
"“I realize that the anti-inflationary program I have offered will impede some business plans, will curb some profit opportunities. and may liriiit some wage advances. It is of the very essence of a plan to counteract inflation that this be done. All groups will ultimately benefit when it is done."

"Commenting yesterday on the President's appointment of Paul Porter, former OPA head, as his adviser on anti-inflation legislation, we suggested that the move seemed almost deliberately calculated to destroy at the outset any hope of cooperation on legislation in this field. If the naming of Mr. Porter did not accomplish this result, then the bill introduced yesterday by Senator Barkley, presumably reflecting the ideas of this adviser, should certainly do so. If any measure ever was put forward by an Administration with its tongue in its cheek, this is such a measure. No intelligent Congress, Republican or Democratic, could possibly stomach this bill, and the Administration must know it."
"The proposed legislation includes the whole hodge-podge of recommendations contained in that part of the President's message dealing with rising prices and living costs. But that is not all. A pleasant surprise has been added by way of giving this legislation the authentic OPA touch. For it includes, as it were, an invitation to revisit that Alice in Wonderland of economics in which the country lived during the reign of OPA. That is the land of Let's Pretend, whose chief industries are statistics and regulations, in which high taxes and black market prices don't count, and where the basic philosophy is that inflation that you can't see can't hurt you."
"Those who may have wondered precisely what Mr. Porter's contribution to the anti-inflation campaign was going to be do not have to wonder any longer. The secret is out. Incredible as it may seem, the surprise is Price Roll-backs. Roll-backs would be applied to any cost-of-living item which has risen “or which threatens to rise"" 20 per cent or more since June, 1946 (when price controls were scrapped). Prices picked for the roll-back would remain under ceilings until June* 30,"
"There is no magic, of course, by which the Administration or any other human power can ""roll” prices back, by word of command, to some appointed level. The term “roll-back” is simply a euphemism to describe a process whereby a producer is induced to sell his product at an agreed price, with the difference between that price and the market price made up to him by government subsidies. And the cost of the subsidies? That, of course, is footed by the taxpayer."
"Subsidies are to be distrusted under any conditions, and distrusted particularly when they come, as they come in the case of price roll-backs, in disguise. But the proposal to reintroduce them into the American economy at the present time represents a new high in economic futility. Britain has been chided by her critics for spending almost two billions a year since the war to hold food prices down. We can be charged with the even greater folly of having spent similar amounts to keep farm prices up. But, never until now has it been seriously proposed, here or anywhere else, that a nation’s taxpayers shoulder the burden of subsidizing price inflation in one political area and price deflation in another, at one and the same time."
"Leaders of the Republican party in Congress returned President Truman's fire by radio tonight, describing his call of a special session as unnecessary and declaring that his anti-inflation proposals would make high prices per-1 manent."
"Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, chairman of the party’s Senate policy committee, promised that Congress would try to work out some cost-of-living curbs without resorting to “police state methods,” but he declared that “price I control and rationing will not work in America in time of peace.” Asserting that Congress was going to go home in about two weeks, he said that “we would be fully justified in adjourning at once.”"

"Many American companies are laying off workers now, rather than waiting to be hit by hard times as they have in the past. Some economists warn that this outburst of corporate preventive medicine increases the odds of a steep recession."
"The number of people laid off in the United States has increased sharply since June, reaching the levels of the early months of the 1981-82 recession. While some companies, including Citicorp, Digital Equipment and McDonnell Douglas, are acting because sales and profits have already begun to shrink, many others, including General Electric’s appliance division and Nordstrom department stores, are only anticipating such a downturn."
"“Businesses are scared and they are cutting costs in anticipation of what they think might happen,” said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ""That sort of costcutting keeps American companies competitive in the world marketplace. But pre-emptive layoffs can be self-fulfilling, frightening people into spending less, which further weakens the economy.”"
"The layoffs, and a smaller number of outright dismissals, in recent months have come in the service sector as well as in manufacturing, reflecting a new interest in cost-cutting, particularly among retailers and financial-services companies. Manufacturers have practiced this sort of cost-cutting for a decade to make themselves more competitive."
"If these principles are respected, it’s possible to raise $300 billion in revenues while, at the same time, taking steps that would be desirable even if there was no budget deficit. Here is the package that budget negotiators should settle on."
"“It’s a very quiet market,” said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. “Caution and profit taking are the watchwords of the day. The market has come a long way, and | there is a big number on Friday. At I this point people are unwilling to make purchases.”"
Most economists are expecting the employment numbers will show that economic conditions deteriorated further last month. A sharp decline in non-farm payroll employment and a fairly sizable increase in the unemployment rate are anticipated.
"A survey of economists about the employment report by MMS International, an economic information service company, shows that most are projecting a decline of 75,000 in nonfarm payroll employment and a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, from 5.7 percent in October."
"A sharp fall in stock prices yesterday reflected growing worries over the health of the economy, especially the erosion of corporate profits, as well as a stock market that has grown increasingly fragile, some traders and analysts say."
"The rapid plunge in prices, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 100 points in little more than an hour of trading, only to stabilize and end the day down by 56.44 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,904.70, came after a series of disappointing earnings reports from companies as diverse as Texas Instruments, the electronics company, and McDonald’s, the hamburger chain."
"Growing Apprehension The selling extended to virtually all stocks, with six stocks falling in price for every one that rose. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell by 6.30, or"
"The profit disappointments came at a time of growing apprehension about the health of the financial system — many large bank stocks are trading at their lowest levels in two years — that had generally not hurt the stock market up to now. While share prices were . | not as expensive, measured against ] such indicators as earnings and interest rates, as they were in the summer of 1987, they were approaching that level, according to many analysts."
"""The market had reached overvalued levels, the economy is sluggish, and corporate profits, while they are not horrendous, are well below the levels of expectations that were built into prices,” said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief American strategist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research."
"According to the Congress’s bipartisan Joint Committee on Tax, the net effect of the Republican tax proposal would be tax increases for Americans with incomes under $50,000 while those with incomes above $50,000 would receive tax cuts. The committee said Americans with incomes over $200,000 a year would receive a tax cut totaling $7.4 billion in the first year."
"The latest proposal by Democrats included a 20 percent surtax on the income taxes paid by people with incomes of more than $500,000 a year. The Associated Press reported. It would also double the taxes on beer and wine, as well as increasing the levy on distilled spirits. Also citing estimates by the Joint Committee on Tax, The Associated Press said the Democratic offer would lower by $4 billion the taxes paid by people with incomes below $20,000, while boosting them by $26.8 billion for everyone else."
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 — A number of the country’s major railroads and railroad-related businesses are failing to pay large amounts of payroll taxes to the Federal Government to finance the unemployment, retirement and medical benefits for the industry’s workers, an audit indicates."
"There is a way to get the economy moving again fairly soon, but it is apparently not on anyone’s agenda. It is a tax on consumer spending — even in the face of the coming Presidential election."
With the recovery from the recession weak or nonexistent. White ouse and Congressional attention is on cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. But using tax cuts to give a short-run boost to the economy would be exactly the wrong way to try to cure the Government’s long-term fiscal problems.
"Because of the Reagan-era tax cuts and the absence of any consensus to cut spending, it appears that the Federal budget will be permanently in the red. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will still be 2 percent of the gross national product even after an economic recovery. Moreover, demand is growing for additional Federal spending, particularly for health care and edu-"
Policy makers thus face a dilemma. A tax cut is needed in the short run while an increase is required for the long run. But this trade-off can be avoided by a tax on consumption — a national sales tax — that would take effect on a specified date in the future.
"Suddenly politicians of every stripe are demanding a tax cut to ""fight the recession."" President Bush turned from opponent to enthusiast overnight. Democratic Congressional leaders called hearings for this week to explore their ideas and the President’s."
"The stampede tells us something about this country. It shows how addicted we are to fulfilling immediate desires, how unable to focus on longterm needs. It shows that we are still gripped by the faith of the Reagan years, though its ruinous effects are all about us: We believe that somewhere there is a free lunch."
"Cutting taxes now is a bad idea on every count. Because the Federal deficit is so high, everyone proposing a cut promises that his plan will . produce no net loss to the Treasury. If that is so, there will be no stimulus to the economy. Some other interest may be served — undoing the Reagan tax law’s tilt toward the rich, for example — but not fighting the recession."
"WASHINGTON. June 27 (AP) — The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims declined in the second week of June, the Labor Department reported today, supporting hopes the nation’s jobs market is on the upswing."
"“That trend was interrupted briefly,"" said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. “But it has been trending lower, suggesting that at least in some sectors, the jobs market is improving.”"
"Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, said, “We’re having a gradual ebbing, and that's consistent with the idea of recovery and further evidence that it’s manifesting itself in a better labor market.”"
"The jobless-claims report, which can be erratic from week to week, helps economists analyze whether companies are adding or laying off workers. The latest number shows that jobs are probably on the rise, but only slightly, said Sam Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities."
"Property-tax delinquencies in New York City are rising again, as they did during the 1970’s, when the city last underwent an economic crisis. But city officials do not expect a recurrence of the wave of the abandonments that destroyed neighborhoods across the South Bronx the last time around."
City officials see the increase — 38 percent in the 12 months ended June 30 — as a result of the real-estate slump and the reluctance of banks to lend to developers. Landlords unable to pay their bills are in effect using the city as a bank: “borrowing” money by not paying property taxes.
"New York City’s economy is in trouble. Unemployment is up 25 percent this year; nearly a million New Yorkers are now on welfare, the most in 15 years. Financial firms, including Morgan Stanley, an industry leader, are pondering leaving. And many other employers express revulsion over filthy streets, crime, aggressive panhandling and soaring drug use."
"Just as city policies didn't create the economic mess, neither will they eradicate it. The forces driving companies out of central business districts to the suburbs and beyond may subside, even reverse. If so, the city government will be a spectator to these trends, not a prime mover."
Yet the city need not wait passively for unknown tidal forces. Intelligent development policies can’t turn an economy right side up but they can improve the lives of millions. Long-term investment for the future might well spell the difference between prosperity and decay.
"To close $30 million of a $3.5 billion budget deficit forecast for fiscal 1992, Mayor Dinkins would suspend New York’s recycling program. But to abandon recycling, however briefly, is to threaten the city’s long-term capacity to handle waste."

"After an emcee warmed up the house, the first would-be Jay Leno took the microphone at 9 P.M. Richard Eastman, an out-of-work book editor, smoothed his straight blond hair anxiously as he strode onstage. His face seemed ashen against the white-painted brick wall. “Unemployment is becoming a lot more popular these days,” he began. “1 read in the paper every morning that more and more people are getting into it.”"
"Among them are lower interest rates, which provide fewer attractive investments; calmer mutual fund investors, who did not stampede out of stock funds over the weekend, and curbs on institutional trading."
The nearly 4 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on F riday ended a week in which economic data seemed to provide evidence that any revival of the economy is still weeks or months away.
"Banks across the country responded immediately and reduced their prime rate, the rate that determines the cost of many mortgages and other consumer and commercial loans, to 7>/i percent from 8 percent, the lowest since 1987. Credit card rates will probably not be affected, but the lower bank rates could save money for people who plan to borrow money to meet Christmas expenses."
"Last week the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate jumped to 6.8 percent in March, its highest level in more than four years. About 2 million Americans have lost their jobs since last summer, more than 700,000 since January."
"Along with the bad news came a cascade of sour predictions that a quick end to the recession “is not in sight” That may be so, but the unemployment rate is about the last place to look. The rate is included in the Government’s index of lagging indicators — meaning that the unemployment rate keeps rising even after the recession is over."
"As the economy begins to recover, companies typically raise production without adding to their payrolls. New hires take place only after employers are convinced the recovery will last."
"American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier and the airline that is considered a leader in determining fares, initiated a broad range of price cuts yesterday in the hope of attracting travelers put off by the gulf war and the recession. But it also raised some fares in an attempt to compensate for revenue lost through the many reductions."
"But that strategy has had an unintended but equally profound secondary effect. It has devastated the city’s poor black neighborhoods, whose residents thrived in the high-wage union jobs of the city’s manufacturing heyday and are now adrift on a rising tide of unemployment, crime and despair."

"LAS VEGAS, Nev., Dec. 29 — For some time Las Vegas has purveyed an escapist world of fantasy and gambling and a view of itself as largely resistant to national recessions."
"Now, the recession has finally hit the Strip, just as it has Atlantic City in New Jersey. There are more visitors than ever under the neon glare, but they are gambling less and spending less. The casinos’ take has dropped substantially in recent months, local home sales are down from the torrid 1990 pace, and unemployment is up. Even the high rollers are lying low; baccarat play is down by a third."
"""It is pretty clear the recession is finally catching up with Las Vegas,” said Alan Feldman, spokesman for the new Mirage Hotel, one of the few hotel-casinos that have thus far weathered the downturn Well. “Whether it will be a serious or mild effect, the jury is still out.”"

"WASHINGTON, May 2 — The Bush Administration and Congressional Democrats are battling again over extra unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless, with Congress apparently determined to make permanent changes in the law and the Administration preferring only another shortterm extension."
"Both men said they would press for permanent statutory changes that would make extended benefits available in recessions much more readily than they are now. Such changes, they said, would be fairer and would keep Congress from having to pass emergency extensions every few months."
"Mr. Bush would like to enact another one-time extension of unemployment benefits, which are scheduled to lapse July 4, for at least 13 more weeks. But the House voted 261 to 150 on Tuesday night to replace the current system of irregular extensions of benefits with one that would automatically grant at least 13 extra weeks of benefits in states where the unemployment rate was 6 percent or higher. In addition, it would immediately provide 20 or 26 more weeks of emergency unemployment benefits."
"WASHINGTON, April 27 — As part of an election-year assault on regulations that it says are choking economic recovery, the Bush Administration has proposed limiting a rule that environmentalists have used to block logging on millions of acres of national forests."

"Studies by two universities indicate that nearly one-third of the nation’s entry-level jobs for new graduates have evaporated during the recession as many large employers have reduced their hiring. At the same time, the market is already glutted with nearly a million unemployed managers and professional workers."

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (AP) — New claims for unemployment benefits jumped sharply early this month and housing starts fell in October, the Government said today in reports that were seen as evidence of a temporary setback for the economy."
"31,000,	to 386,000, for the week that ended on Nov. 7, the Labor Department said. It was the biggest increase in three months and the highest level of claims in six weeks."
"Housing starts fell 1.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million, the Commerce Department said. Housing starts had risen in August and September."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 — In an election-year budget of $1.52 trillion, President Bush called today for modest increases in a wide range of popular domestic programs, but he avoided any major change in spending priorities to fight the recession."
"Hoping to breathe life into a listless economy, Mr. Bush proposed tax breaks for investors, home buyers, businesses and families with children. His proposals turned out to be less drastic than some of the tax cuts considered by his advisers over the last two months."
"LONDON, Jan. 29 — Like President Bush, with whom he will have dinner in New York on Thursday night, Prime Minister John Major of Britain has to face an election this year in almost the worst possible economic circumstances: a recession whose end is not yet in sight."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 — The economy grew at a surprisingly brisk pace of 2.7 percent in the July-September period, the Commerce Department reported today. This was the sixth consecutive quarterly advance in gross domestic product, the most comprehensive measure of economic activity within American borders."
The dollar value of the output surpassed the pre-recession peak registered in the 1990 second quarter.
"And specialists working in the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, noted that growth in the last six quarters had averaged 1.8 percent — less than one-third the rate for comparable periods in the other eight postwar recoveries. They said the third-quarter advance could not be sustained."
"“The long recession is over,” asserted Lawrence A. Hunter, chief economist for the United Stales Chamber of Commerce. “The jump in February housing starts and industrial production — in addition to markedly improved business confidence and retail sales — signal a clear turning point for the economy."""
"Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1,304,000 during the' month, the Commerce Department re- ported. The pace was 9.6 percent above that of January, which itself was substantially stronger than first estimated. The broadly based gain also raised the pace of housing starts to the fastest in nearly two years."
"And at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities, output was up six-tenths of 1 percent in February after falling in each of the three preceding months, the Federal Reserve reported. A rebound in production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for about half the gain."
"You’d think that by now Ross Perot could keep a few basic facts in his very own head. We’re not disking for much, just a few numbers that would help ordinary folks understand how he intends to do the one thing he says Bill Clinton can’t do, which is to bring the budget deficit to zero. After all, this is a man who’s been talking economics day and night for two years, usually with a pointer and charts. But without the charts, Mr. Perot can’t remember a thing."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 — Three Democratic Congressional leaders said today that a tax cut for the middle class, one of President-elect Bill Clinton’s major campaign promises, might have to be put off because of the soaring Federal budget deficit."
"Their tone made it clear that the Congressional Democrats, who twice passed bills with middle-class tax cuts last year in efforts to embarrass President Bush, would not hold Mr. Clinton’s feet to the same fire and would support his economic proposals, whether or not they emerge with promised tax cuts."
"On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton’s spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, used the new, sharply higher Bush Administration estimate of the 1997 deficit — $305 billion instead of the $237 billion it had forecast in July — to suggest that it might not be possible for Mr. Clinton to keep his promise to cut the deficit in 'half in four years."
"Mr. Stephanopoulos did not mention the deficit’s impact on the tax-cut pledge and would not discuss it directly ■when asked about it today, saying instead, “As circumstances change, you imust examine every part of the pro-jgram.” | A top Republican, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said [today that Mr. Clinton should have iknown by late summer that the deficit was going to be larger than the Administration’s July estimate, and he indicated that he thought Mr. Clinton would 'have to raise, not lower, taxes."
"Commerce Secretary Ronald ' H.; Brown and some private-sector economists attributed the deterioration to economic stagnation abroad, which reduces demand for American goods, and continued growth in the United States, which leaves Americans better able to afford imports."
"But now, recent signs, of weakness notwithstanding, the recovery that began in the nation’s center seems to be fanning out to the rest of the country. Exports to Latin America and tourists from Europe are helping to revive Florida and the rest of the Southeast. Stronger car sales have given a lift to parts of the Midwest, although recent floods could cause a temporary setback. In Texas and other South Central states, service businesses and high-technology manufacturing are expanding. A few Western states have been growing so fast that businesses are running out of people to hire."
"In deeply depressed California and the rest of the Pacific Southwest, sales and income tax collections have stopped shrinking and business people say the economy may have touched bottom. The northern New England states are growing again, and there are signs of life even in Connecticut, which is still reeling from military cutbacks. And New Jersey has started to regain some of the jobs it lost."
"The extent of the spreading recovery is mirrored in a variety of broad economic statistics. Employment — though still shrinking in a few states — is higher this year in all but one region, the South Central states, than it was in the first half of last year. Help-wanted advertising, a sensitive indicator of changes in the job market, has turned up in seven of the nine regions in the last three months, though it is still far below its pre'fecession peak."
"And while factory employment, historically a source of good jobs, has dropped to its lowest point since the mid-1960’s, in most regions industrial production has recovered to pre-recession levels. This means more profits and wages for manufacturers and workers."
"A drop in oil prices to their lowest levels in five years rippled through the stock market yesterday, dragging down shares in big oil producers while buoying those of transportation companies."
"Most stocks inched forward in a subdued session that ended early because of the holiday weekend, but the Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.63, to 3,683.95. The index was depressed by Chevron, down 4V4, to 85%; Texaco, down 1%, to 63%, and Exxon, down 1%, to 61%. For the week, the Dow dropped 10.06 points."
"Falling oil prices lifted shares of companies whose businesses consume large amounts of fuel. The Dow Jones transportation average shot up 28.85 points, to 1,739.89. And in the bond market, where the prospect of an easing of inflationary pressure heartened ^traders, prices also rose and interest rates fell. |Page 39.) Discord at OPEC"

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 — With the notable exception of California, the economy showed continued improvement in December and early January, with sizable gains in retail sales augmented by better activity in factories and residential construction, a survey published today by the Federal Reserve Board said."
"Finally emerging from the recession, nearly all the stptes are planning their first budgets in years without big tax increases or deep cuts in programs."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 — Responding quickly to new projections of larger deficits from President Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton appeared today to back off his campaign pledge to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years."
"In Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton said the new figures, issued today by the White House as part of Mr. Bush's final budget, were an “unsettling revelation."" But in the campaign, Mr. Clinton was repeatedly told by his advisers that the deficit would be larger than "" acknowledged by Mr. Bush or assumed by Mr. Clinton in his campaign manifesto."
"Mr. Clinton and his aides seemed to be using the new estimates of the deficit from the Bush White House to begin revising Mr. Clinton’s campaign promises. The Clinton stance also suggested the possibility that the President-elect wanted to lay early political groundwork for unpopular measures to cut the growth of spending, or even perhaps to raise some taxes."
"Aides to Mr. Clinton said that he still wanted to halve the deficit, but that it would probably take more than four years to achieve that goal. “It would be imprudent to go too far on deficit reduction so you put the economy in a tailspin,” said a member of Mr. Clinton's transition team."
"Mr. Bush’s budget for the fiscal year 1994, which begins Oct. 1, shows Federal spending of $1.5 trillion, equal to nearly one-fourth of the nation’s total output of goods and services. It shows a deficit of $292.4 billion in 1994, rising to $305 billion in 1997."
"White House officials, who had privately maintained until recently that short-term rates above 4 percent would be unacceptable, quickly retreated from that position today as it seemed increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve would breach that level soon."
"The Federal Reserve’s stance means that investors, who have been trading in declining, turbulent markets the last month, may not be able to find comfort even if monthly inflation reports continue to show that current price increases are moderate, as was Indicated by the data for March issued this week. Despite the positive numbers, the Federal Reserve will still be leaning toward pushing short-term interest rates higher."
"In an Op-Ed article in Friday's issue of The New York Times, Laura D’Andrea Tyson, who heads the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, argues that inflation is in check and that “the financial markets appear to be reacting more to inflation myths than to realities.’’ |Page A31.)"
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 — As the United States economy's growth continues unabated 10 months after the Federal Reserve began trying to slow it, more and more economists are concluding that the central bank’s all-purpose tool, raising or lowering interest rates, is not as effective as it used to be."
"To these economists and to a number of former Fed officials, figures like those in the Labor Department's report Friday showing a sharp drop in unemployment last month signal a quiet erosion of the Fed’s influence."
"No one questions the tremendous power the Fed can wield if it raises interest rates sharply or keeps them high for a long time. But changes in the country’s financial system, notably the declining role of banks as providers of money for companies and consumers, may make it necessary for the Fed to make bigger increases or to wait longer to get the same effect, they say."
"Last month, for instance, the Fed abandoned the pattern of quarter-point or half-point increases it had followed since February, instead pushing up the rates that banks pay for short-term borrowing by three-quarters of a percentage point, its biggest increase in 13 years."
The stock and bond markets fell sharply amid growing concerns that long-term Interest rates are likely to continue rising. Page Dl.
Interest rates surged again yesterday as traders and investors continued to worry about the steady pace of economic growth and inflation. But the Federal Reserve tried to play down their concerns.
"Long-term interest rates jumped to an eight-month high, with the yield on the 30-year bond finishing at 6.73 percent. Shorter-term rates also shot higher, with the yield on the three-year note at 5.07 percent, its highest since December 1992."
"In an effort to cut off a jump in inflation before it began, the Federal Reserve raised its target for shortterm interest rates to 3.25 percent from 3 percent on Feb. 4. But rather than reassuring traders and investors, the move seemed to create new concern about inflation, and long-"
"The Government has changed the way it determines the national unemployment rate, which has resulted in a number that is marginally higher. But the new and supposedly improved methodology does not provide anything close to an accurate picture of a devastating jobs crisis that is becoming ever more entrenched."
"Legions of Americans who once felt secure in the workplace are now stunned to find themselves caught in the hideous undertow of long-term unemployment. You don’t hear much from them after that. The jobless tend to go quietly. One day they’re at their work station, the next day they’re not. When enough time passes, they’re no longer even counted as unemployed."
"If you take this group, which increasingly includes middle-class and middle-aged men and women, and link it up with the people who have been forced into part-time or temporary work, and with people who are calling themselves self-employed but who are really making little or no money, and with the underclass of inner-city Americans who have long been among the permanently unemployed, you have a problem with frightening implications."
"You cannot deal effectively with public safety, health care reform and welfare reform without engaging the employment crisis."
"In November 1991, when President Bush signed a bill extending jobless benefits, there were 1.3 million Americans officially designated as longterm unemployed, meaning they had been out of work for six months or longer. Those benefits have been cut back, but last month the number of long-term unemployed was 1.7 million."
"Squeezed by the rigid spending ceilings that'were enacted last year to lower the budget deficit, the House of Representatives has approved only a fraction or the new money President Clinton sought this year for his main domestic initiatives."
"prised by the Administration’s relatively laid-back behavior today. Some viewed it as a gutsy high-risk strategy to convince the market that the dollar’s fall was ndt justified by economic fundamentals, much like a doctor allowing a patient to heal naturally before trying more drastic intervention."
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — America's trade deficit with the rest of the world rose sharply in July to the second-highest level in history, the Government said today in a report that fanned inflation fears, rattled the financial markets and depressed the value of stocks, bonds and the dollar."
"The worse-than-expected trade report came as Japanese auto companies, in a highly unusual move, warned the Clinton Administration that they might break off their cooperation with the American auto industry, particularly their purchases of American auto parts, if the White House imposed trade sanctions on- Japan."
"There was some positive news on trade matters for the Administration today, though. The Japanese Finance Ministry informed Washington that the Government in Tokyo intended to put off imposing a consumption tax for three years instead of the two-year delay originally planned. A longer delay in the tax should help stimulate the Japanese economy and the purchase of American goods by Japanese consumers."
"When the Fed raises rates to combat inflation, rates on loans paid by ..consumers follow. Yesterday's Fed increase was the sixth this year. Here is how the first five affected the cost of some sample loans."
The Federal Reserve’s decision to Increase Interest rates by the largest amount In years intensified a debate that focuses not so much on the amount of the rise but whether the Federal Reserve should have ucted at all.
"On one side ure those who applauded the Federal Reserve's action, most of them on Wall Street. They are challenged by an unlikely coalition of manufacturers and labor leaders who charged that yesterday’s Increase would slow the economy loo much, cutting back sales and eliminating jobs."
"If we require some perpetual proportion of Americans to be unemployed, they must either starve to death or live as “parasites” off government entitlements or private charity. If we end welfare, and private charities do not replace these entitlement payments, three dreadful scenarios are possible."
"Under this scenario of starving the unemployed, additional employed survivors must continually be sacrificed. Then, as Keynes noted in a slightly different context, “in the long run we’ll all be dead.”"
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 — After three days of intense negotiations with top Mexican officials, the United States is preparing to announce details of a plan to bail the country out of a continuing currency crisis, including newly toughened restrictions that are likely to send already high Mexican interest rates soaring."
"Also included in the draft of an agreement here is a toughening of a highly controversial condition that Washington is placing on the Mexicans: The United States would effectively control the flow of the billions of dollars that Mexico earns every year from the export of its oil, starting in the next few months."
"Morrison Knudsen jolted the stock market when the troubled construction giant announced that its 1994 losses would be far larger than expected and that its acting chairman, William P. Clark, was resigning."
"The Morrison Knudsen Corporation jolted the stock market yesterday with a double dose of bad news: Its 1994 losses are far larger than its recent pessimistic forecasts. And its acting chairman, William P. Clark, is resigning from the giant construction conjpany’s board to return to his consulting business."
"The stock market declined yesterday, with signs abounding that last week’s upward momentum had been turned around. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 12.78 points to close at 3,869.43."
"The market was weighed down by inflation concerns prompted by a report showing a brisk pace in housing starts and by a surge in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The reports solidified the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which could slow the economy as well as raise corporate borrowing costs. In addition, a weak dollar, sharply lower bond prices and a slew of bad corporate news helped to push stock prices downward."
"Yesterday’s session was also a ""double witching,” when options on individual stocks and options on stock indexes expire simultaneously. These expirations, which fostered a great deal of computer-guided program trading on Thursday as well, contributed to volatility."
"""The day’s market activity was evidence of an economy that is not cooling as fast as had been thought as recently as last week,” said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason in Baltimore. ""Obviously the outside influences were reasons for many investors to take profits."""
"The consensus among market analysts is that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates by one-half of a percentage point when its policy-making group meets on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. A week ago, faced with a report showing sagging retail sales, some analysis were doubting that there would be any increase at all."
"In response, traders bought dollars and sold marks and yen. After falling to new lows in trading in Tokyo, the dollar recovered in trading in New York to 91.42 yen, from 90.05	on Tuesday, and to 1.3960 marks from 1.3705. Higher rates in the United States would make it more attractive for foreigners to invest in dollars, while lower rates in Germany would help reduce the flow of money into German marks."
"In testimony to the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan described the fall of the dollar as “unwelcome and troublesome,” as well as excessive, and said the Fed would notolet inflation be driven up by a weak currency."
"WASHINGTON, March 22 — In an ominous sign for the economy and the Clinton Administration, the nation’s trade deficit soared by two-thirds in January to a record $12.23 billion."
"There was strong evidence that the United States' usual imbalance, caused largely by Asian nations that export far more to this country than they buy in return, was being worsened as Mexico, recently a major importer of American goods, plunged deeper into economic crisis."
"The severity of the trade gap reported today by the Commerce Department took the Clinton Administration by surprise. Although the dollar fell to a record low of 89 Japanese yen in New York trading, the decline was relatively modest, given the big jump in the deficit."
"WASHINGTON, July 31 — The White House said today that revised projections showed that the Federal budget deficit for the current .fiscal year would now be $160 billion — or $33 billion lower than previously estimated — and that President Clinton’s plan for balancing the budget in 10 years could probably succeed in 9."
"Mr. Clinton pronounced the latest figures good news, and his top aides acknowledged that the revised estimates might help to foster a compromise with the Republicans, who want to balance the budget in seven years with spending cuts that the< Administration contends are unreal-1* istically large.	I “I’m sure somebody will suggest! that,"" the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said of a possible compromise as Mr. Clinton flew aboard Air Force One to the National Governors’ Association meeting in Burlington, VL	*	."
"But the budget director, Alice M.j Rivlin, in a briefing at the White; House, repeated the Administra-! tion’s longstanding view that balanc-| ing the budget by a certain date was less important than balancing it without damaging programs in areas the President considers most important, like education."
"said. Among other points, she noted, the Republicans favor far bigger cuts in growth of Medicare spending than Mr. Clinton has been willing to accept and at the same time they want steep tax cuts. Mr. Panetta attributed the decline in the projected deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to better-than-expected growth in the economy and a spending cut bill signed last week by Mr. Clinton that trimmed $9 billion from current spending."
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 — Household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, the Census Bureau reported today, as the number of poor people in the United States dropped by more than 1.6 million, reaching historic lows for blacks and the elderly."
"The bureau said half the households in the country had incomes of at least $34,074, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. The inflation-adjusted increase of $898 was the first rise in median household income since 1989, the year before the nation’s last recession, and it was the largest increase in household earnings since 1986."
"At the same time, the percentage of the nation’s population that is poor dropped to 13.8, from 14.5 in 1994. It was the second consecutive year of a decline in the poverty rate."
"The report said that 29.3 percent of blacks in the United States lived below the poverty line in 1995. For the first time since 1959, when the Census Bureau started keeping such statistics — and probably for the first time in the nation’s history — the poverty rate for African-Americans dipped below 30 percent."
"Also for the first time, the poverty rate for the nation’s elderly last year dropped below that of working-age people, making those 65 years of age and older the group with the lowest percentage of poor people."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 — By almost any statistical measure, the reduction in the Federal budget deficit, hailed by President Clinton today, is impressive: it has dropped to its lowest level in 15 years, so low that the United States now has the smallest deficit — as a percentage of its economy — of any of the world’s largest industrialized nations."
"The most popular theory is that investors, convinced that they have ridden the stock market surge as far as they dare, are beginning to reap their profits, which funnels capital gains tax revenue to the Government. Others note that since most of the Increased revenue seems to be coming from individual tax returns and speculate that the swelling of the employment rolls is turning nontax-paying households into taxpayers. But usually people entering the work force for the first time are not paying big tax bills."
Recalling that Ruth W. Messinger had “stuck by me” through his own difficult New York political contest five years ago. President Clinton made a long-sought trip to Manhattan last night and vigorously urged voters to support her mayoral bid. He asserted that she had grasped the main issues confronting the city now that crime was in decline: failing schools and lingering unemployment.
"“I say to you, I believe if 1 were mayor of New York City,” Mr. Clinton said, “I would say my three priorities are: I’m going to get the unemployment rates down to the national level. I’m going to fix our schools and I’m going to give these kids something to do after school to keep them out of trouble.”"
"Mr. Clinton’s proposal came after a week of turmoil in world financial markets and growing fears that ilj'e l.M.F.’s severe shortage of moneyis paralyzing its ability to calm investors, who are pulling billions of dol; lars out of emerging-market court* tries."
"The move is motivated, Mr. Cltifi ton said, by mounting evidence thitt the financial turmoil is threatening the United States."
"At the White House, the President’s chief economic adviser, Janet L. Yellen, exulted in the latest set of figures, which represented a nearperfect combination of decent growth and stable prices."
"“Unemployment hovers in a dec-ades-low range, jobs are being created at a robust pace and there are still no signs of inflationary pressures,” Ms. Yellen said in a statement."
"All figures are seasonally adjusted except discouraged workers. 'Hispanic people can be of any race. fPeople not working but not counted as unemployed because they have become too discouraged to look: must have searched in the past 12 months and been available for work when surveyed ture was the fact that the ranks of the unemployed grew by 302,000, •more than offsetting May’s improvement. Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, though, the job market remains in healthy shape, analysts said. And after hitting a 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May, a modest rise in unemployment could provide some breathing room to let the economy, now in its seventh year of uninterrupted growth, expand for a longer period without a recession."
"Stocks had fallen sharply on Friday, and some investors were worried that if the Dow fell another 15 points, to 10 percent below the record it set on March 11, the bull market might be in serious jeopardy."
"Yesterday’s gain was bolstered by strong corporate earnings reports and by bargain hunters. ""It was time for the blue chips to come back,” said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential Securities, though the market remains sensitive to any bad news."
"That view held that Asia’s problems were relatively unimportant to this country’s economy, and that the United States’ financial markets would benefit as a rush of money from abroad sought safety, driving American stock and bond prices higher. In addition, it was hoped by many on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve would be sufficiently alarmed about Asia that it would push interest rates lower."
"In fact, the Asian woes have begun to hurt the profits of many companies, both those that sell to Asian customers and those that compete with Asian companies whose sinking currencies have made price reductions possible. Poor profit reports, combined with Mr. Greenspan’s comments, seem to explain the falling share prices."
"There was a funny political cartoon recently, spoofing the fact that nothing President Clinton does seems to affect his poll ratings — as long as the stock market keeps rising. The cartoon showed a newscaster announcing that a severed head fid'd been found in Mr. Clinton’s sleeping quarters in the White House, but with the Dow having reached a new record high the U.S. public was indifferent."
"How long, oh Lord, how long can the U.S. keep thriving while everyone elSe is in turmoil? Is America now on another planet or what? I posed that question to Goldman, Sachs’ re-nov/ned market analyst Abby Joseph Cohen. Her answer: It can last longer than you might think."
"Ms. Cohen argues that the U.S. economy is a lot like a supertanker — not the prettiest of ships, not the fastest, but once it got on the right course, once the U.S. Government ild leading corporations went through the necessary deregulation and streamlining to get ready for this era of rapid technological change and global markets, “this U.S. supertanker is not easily set off course, and it s the sort of ship you want to be on when the seas get rough.”"
"Sure, the U.S. must care about what happens abroad, says Ms. Cohen, After all, America is the world’s largest importer and exporter. But the.U.S. economy is so big that foreign trade is still only 13 percent of overall U.S. economic activity, which remains “quite robust,” notes Ms. Cohen. Moreover, U.S. foreign trade is divided pretty evenly among Western Europe, Asia and North and South America. So while Asia’s on its back. Canada, Latin America and many Western European countries are getting stronger."
"For the last three years investors have been sleepwalking their way to riches in the stock market. Putting money into a stock index fund — a one-decision move — has proved not only the best way to avoid underperforming the averages, but also the path to outsized profits. The Vanguard Group’s fund that mirrors the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has almost doubled since the end of 1934."
"But the heyday of this particular investment strategy may have ended on Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 300 points. Even though the major market averages rebounded ever so slightly yesterday, the sharp drop on Tuesday, coming on top of recent weakness, belied what might be the beginning of a big shift in investor psychology."
"Renewed fears that Asia’s economic crisis will stall growth in the profits of American companies sent United States’ stocks plunging yesterday, the worst in a string of recent selloffs that has now erased the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones industrial average."
"Since crossing the 9,000 mark in April — a level almost 1,100 points above where the blue-chip average began the year — the Dow has faced trouble sustaining that height."
"The barometer of the nation’s top industrial companies fell 207.01 points yesterday, to 8,627.93, a 2.3 percent drop that left it down 6.3 percent from its record high. Some other market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting that a stock market correction — a drop of 10 percent or more — is under way."
"The selloff erased the last of the market’s gains this year and sent stock prices down more than 19 percent from their peak set just £ix weeks ago, the sharpest decline Jin eight years.	>,"
The frenzied selling dashed the hopes of investors who had expected the market’s recent slump — whifch began with worries over econonjic conditions in Asia and accelerated as financial troubles ensnared Russia — to be stayed by the fundamental strength of the American economy.
"The Dow Jones industrial average fell 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, lo 7,539.07, leaving the bellwether index 4.7 percent below where it started the year. The decline was the second largest in the Dow’s history in point terms, trailing the 554-point drop last Oct. 27, but it did not rank in the top 20 when measured in percentage terms. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the market, fell more than 69 points, or nearly 7 percent, to 957.28, down 1.3 percent since the beginning of 1998. The declines were the greatest among technology stocks, which until recently had been the market leaders."
"The cumulative effect of the last few weeks is nearly as great as the one-day market plunge on Oct. 19, 1987, when stock prices fell 22.6 percent. But a market rebound soon followed and the national economy did not stray into recession."
"While there were few signs yesterday of panic among individual- investors, market participants said that selling by mutual fund companies, responding to withdrawals by individual investors that began over the weekend, played a part in th? decline, including the stampede that sent the Dow average down 250 points in the last half-hour of trading."
"The economy grew at a surprisingly strong pace this winter, and inflation remained unexpectedly subdued, the Government reported yesterday."
"Instead of slowing down as the Asian recession hit American manufacturers, the economy picked up speed, growing at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. And instead of drifting higher as Washington and Wall Street feared, the broadest measure of Inflation dipped below 1 percent to its lowest rate since 1964."
"“We keep expecting a slowdown and it never comes,” said Jeffrey A. Frankel of the Council of Economic Advisers. ""We’re returning to the economy of the 50’s and 60's — a remarkable, remarkable combination of strong growth without inflation.”"
"Investors had been worrying that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise interest rates, a concern that sent the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting more than 140 points on Monday. Yesterday, they decided to focus on the good news on Inflation, which touched off rallies in the stock and bond markets, with the Dow climbing 111.85 points, to 9,063.37."
"WASHINGTON, June 29 (Bloomberg News) — Sales of new homes rose in May to a record level, fueled by low interest rates and high consumer optimism."
"New single-family home 7 * sales rose three-tenths of a percent in May, to an annual rate of 890,000 units, the Commerce Department said today, breaking the previous record set"" in April. Analysts had expected a drop in May sales to an annual rate of 877,000 units."
"“It’s so good that it’s scary,” said Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive at the luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. “We’re enjoying a fabulous market and I would expect it’s going to continue as long as the economy is supportive.” The housing strength has been defined by the longest stretch ever of new-home sales exceeding an 800.000-	unit annual pace. May marked the ninth consecutive month the pace of sales was above that level. Sales of new ! one-family homes in the first quarter averaged 855,000 a month at an annual rate, a record and up 3.3 percent from the 828,000 average a month in the fourth quarter. New-home sales rose 15.7 percent in the West, to a 265,000 rate, in the Northeast new-home sales rose 3.3 percent, to a 94,000 rate, the highest since a similar pace in March 1997.

"The mood was decidedly downbeat in the United States. The International Monetary Fund's annual meeting ended in Washington without agreement from the ministers in attendance on a plan to resolve the crisis. [Page A6.] And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve’s once upbeat chairman, said the likelihood of continued good times in America had “weakened measurably.” [Page Cl.|"
"His blunt statement was taken as a hint that the Fed would again lower interest rates, and the Dow Jones industrial average, perhaps in response, recovered from a 100-point fall to finish almost unchanged. But Nasdaq tumbled to 15-month low."
"One implication of that rising deficit is that a steady increase in competitively priced imports can, over time, lead to an erosion of American market share and jobs."
"As they surveyed their outsized stock market gains over the last three years, some investors may have thought to wonder, on occasion and in an idle sort of way, just what a"
"Yesterday was different in another way, however. It marked the first time in years that the three most popular market indexes — the Dow Jones, the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — actually lost ground for the year. Until now, the declines in the indexes."
"No longer. Investors, playing with the house’s money all year, are now faced with the prospect of giving up some of their own. Even those who own index funds, which had registered gains until yesterday, are now eating into last year’s gains."
"There was no stopping the selling. No “circuit breakers” to stop trading on the New York Stock Exchange to give investors time to regain their reason before they resumed the furious unloading of shares. Under the new rules instituted by the exchange last October, it would take a fall of 900 points for trading to be halted."
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 — The Congressional Budget Office projected today that the Federal budget deficit would be all but eliminated this year, continuing a deluge of good fiscal news that has both political parties . eager to begin dividing the spoils."
"' The budget office said the deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 would be just $5 billion, down from . $22.7 billion last year and so small in 1 a $1.7 trillion budget as to be almost meaningless. t Its analysis showed even smaller ^deficits for the next two years, and"
"The $5 billion figure for this year was far more specific than President Clinton’s announcement on Monday that White House budget analysts expect the 1998 deficit to decline to below $22 billion, and it is the latest evidence of how jhe strong economy is propelling Washington into an era of fiscal plenty far faster than almost anyone anticipated. As recently as last September, the budget office was predicting a $57 billion deficit for this year."
"leadership agreed on a plan last summer to balance the budget by 2002. The President said on Monday that he now expected to balance the budget next year, three years ahead of schedule."
"But the budget office’s projections, which in recent years have proven considerably too pessimistic, confirmed the predictions of many private analysts that the deficit could be wiped out this year, well before most of the spending cuts called for by the budget deal take effect."
The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are beginning to unnerve the nation’s more affluent families and make them more cautious in their spending.
"The consumers in question are people like Ellen Elias, a partner in an upscale Manhattan appliance store, Elgot, at 937 Lexington Avenue, a woman in her forties who says she “owns enough stock to be concerned.” She is hoping that stock prices will rebound by the time she needs the money, closer to her retirement. Since mid-July, when the sell-off began, American stocks have lost $1.5 trillion of their value, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, estimated last week. If this decline continues, Ms. Elias said, she may have second thoughts about some of her spending."
"Markets surged after the Government released a report that showed a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns about inflation. The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April blunted the effect of a surge in energy prices. The increase was below analysts’ forecasts and when the volatile food and energy components were excluded, prices were unchanged."
The July figures seemed to rule out any need for the Federal Reserve to increase a key lending rate by more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"The stock and bond markets surged yesterday after the Government released a reassuring report that showed a modest increase in prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns about inflation."
"The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April blunted the Impact of a surge in energy prices. The July increase, which followed a decline of one-tenth of a percent in June, was below analysts’ forecasts. When the volatile food and energy components were excluded, prices were unchanged."
"The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 184.26 points, its biggest rise since mid-June, as interest rates fell as much as one-tenth of a percentage point."
"Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman, yesterday served notice that he does not want to spoil the fun. While the Fed did raise an important interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, as had been widely expected, it also said its policy was now neutral, rather than biased in favor of a further increase. Wall Street celebrated by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 200 points in the first 15 minutes after the Fed announcement. Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues seem to be betting that the economy will cool down without much action by the central bank."
"The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 11,299.76, up 199.15 points, or 1.79 percent. The average has risen 23 percent so far this year, well above its 16 percent gain during all of 1998. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index also rose 1.77 percent Monday, but remains 4.1 percent below its high reached on July 16."
"The turnabout in investor mood comes after weeks of directionless and confused stock trading. Having peaked in mid-July, most of the market indexes fell as investors grew concerned that rising commodity prices and labor costs as well as strong economic growth around the world would push the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on rates. A slight weakening in the dollar, which could push up prices of imported goods and make United States stocks less attractive abroad, was also a worry."
"Certainly it is good news ^ that the benefits of a vigorous economy have started to trickle J down toward young r black men in the inner cities. According to a recent study by the economists Richard Freeman and William Rodgers, even black males ages 16 to 24 are working more often, earning better wages and committing fewer crimes than was the case during the recession of the early 1990’s."
"But before concluding that a booming economy has succeeded where government job training and affirmative action programs have failed, we should recall some elementary facts of economic history."
There is good reason to think that a similar reversal will happen again once the current expansion ends.
"“We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services” when making decisions about interest rates, Mr."
"The stock market, in response to Mr. Greenspan’s remarks, which were delivered at an annual conference on monetary policy issues organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, fell moderately today. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 108.28 points, or near-' ly 1 percent, closing at 11,090.17 in light trading. [Page C3.J"
"Relying on the surplus reduces the sacrifices that would be necessary from today’s workers and tomorrow’s retirees, and for that reason Republicans, too, have generally endorsed allocating a big portion of the surplus to Social Security."
"Mr. Clinton has alluded in general terms to the need for measures in addition to using the surplus, but has avoided specifics, while Republicans have been silent or called for solutions that require neither tax increases nor benefit cuts."
"the White House’s Social Security proposal, saying that its call for the Government to invest $700 billion in the stock market would result in political meddling in the free enterprise system. But Mr. Greenspan was supportive again today of Mr. Clinton’s call for a large portion of the surplus to be used to bolster Social Security by paying down the national debt."
"These are astounding economic times. Overseas, Europe is slowing, most of Asia is in recession $nd Brazil threatens to drag down much of South America. But in the United States, consumers are spending with abandon and economists continue to toe surprised by how robust the economy is."
"It was against that background that Alan 'Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. He again predicted that the economy would slow this year, and again warned that stock prices appeared to be overvalued."
"More than any other factor, the long decline in the value of the dollar appears to have pushed up the inflation rate in recent months."
"In the absence of cheaper foreign products, the manufacturers of many basic materials, like chemicals, plastics, paper, steel, copper and liner-board, have managed to impose hefty price increases that feed inflation."
"“The weak dollar is finally showing up as an inflation factor,” said John D. Paulus, chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Company."
"Unusually Strong Jump Such increases, some of them more than 20 percent last year, are a major reason why the national inflation rate is higher today than it was last summer. Inflation took an unusually strong jump in January, raising an alarm that it might be getting out of hand. In response, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates up noticeably last week, hoping to discourage the borrowing and constant buying that help generate inflation."
"President Bush’s plan to resolve the financial troubles of the nation’s savings industry is based on assumptions that interest rates will decline sharply and deposits increase steadily in coming years, according to figures made available yesterday by the Office of Management and Budget."
"The projections were immediately criticized by some private analysts, who said the figures were based on an overly optimistic view of the economy, interest rales and inflation over the next 10 years. They said the plan underestimated the true cost of the rescue by many billions of dollars."
"“The interest-rate projections are wildly optimistic,"" said Bert Ely, a consultant in Alexandria, Va."
The new figures added to the debate that has surrounded the rescue plan since it was announced two weeks ago.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 - In an unusually direct statement, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the nation’s inflation rate was unacceptably high and that he would seek to reduce it."
Mr. Greenspan’s remarks raised the possibility that short-term interest rates might be pushed higher.
"""Our strategy continues to be centered on moving toward, and ultimately reaching, stable prices — that is, price levels sufficiently stable so that expectations of change do not become major factors in key economic decisions,” Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee. “Current inflation rates, by that criterion, clearly are too high and must be brought down.”"

"It is time to come to grips with the economic challenges of raising efficiency, rather than contenting ourselves with controlling surface symptoms, such as inflationary pressure, which, while important, do not get at the fundamental problems. Those problems apply north of the border as well.	Alan	Abouchar"
"Your advocacy of motor fuel price increases to raise revenue and reduce the Federal deficit (editorial, Dec. 12) reflects a widespread misunderstanding that has too long characterized pricing policy for public services: the stale is somehow expected to provide all the highway infrastructure and allow use without reference to imposed cost."
"Sales taxes on road-related products are merely indirect taxes, like those on clothing or chocolates, and when there is a need for more revenue to reduce the inflationary impact of large deficits, sales taxes provide a ready source. The “nickel tax"" increase passed in 1984 was the most recent example of such thinking. Like most other road-sector fees and taxes throughout North America, it failed to come to grips with the challenge of economic efficiency, which requires that, since trucks do damage that varies exponentially with their weight, the prices they should pay to"
"CHICAGO Aug. I — If one thing was clear at the close of the 81st annual meeting of the National Governors’ Association today, it was that the Federal budget deficit will place a growing burden on the states and make innovation far more difficult."
", WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) — The United States budget deficit rose to $25.47 billion in May, higher than the $22.58 billion deficit in May 1988, the Treasury Department said today."
"In the first eight months of the 1989 fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, the budget deficit shrank to $113.32 billion, from $128.43 billion in the comparable period a year ago, the department said."
"The Bush Administration has projected a rise in the deficit to $163.3 billion for the 1989 fiscal year, from"
Prices spurted across the maturity spectrum immediately after release yesterday morning of a smaller-than-anticipaled March trade deficit.
"Specifically, the 7.4 percent increase in exports, to a record $30.78 billion, showed continued strength in the manufacturing sector."
"The figures suggest that upcoming revisions to economic growth statistics for the first quarter will not be pushed downward, a move some economists had said might occur if the trade report was not particularly strong. In addition, the strong export growth diminishes the possibility that the Federal Reserve Board might move soon to ease credit conditions."
"The export figures, coupled with a report from the nation's purchasing managers earlier this month suggesting that export growth was vibrant in April, suggest that an important component of the economy remains vigorous. The Fed is not likely to ease policy as long as the manufacturing sector remains strong."
"Prices of Treasury notes and bonds slipped in light trading yesterday, as dealers sold securities after a report from regional Federal Reserve banks showed that the economy remained a bit stronger than anticipated."
"While the report, which is referred to as the ‘‘beige book” or ‘‘tan book,” was cited as the main source of selling pressure, some participants said the activity had the scent of a shift in sentiment."
"“The specific excuse you will hear is that the tan book didn’t show enough evidence to let the Fed ease policy,” one Government-bond trader said. ""But the market is trading very poorly. Dealer positions are larger than the pace of business."
"In addition to the beige book, which said the economy was ""stable to modestly expanding"" in November, market participants reacted to comments from an unidentified senior Federal Reserve official that appeared on the Market News Service."
"The lower trade balance signals that the United States is becoming more competitive. Administration officials and many economists hailed the report as an indication, in particular, that improvement has been achieved despite the run-up in the dollar since the beginning of the year."
"The September figure of $10.5 billion, an improvement of $1.8 billion from August, reflected both higher exports and lower imports. Page Dl."
"WASHINGTON. Nov. 16 — The United States trade deficit shrank to $10.5 billion in September, a double-barreled $1.8 billion improvement that reflected both higher exports and lower imports."
"While today’s Commerce Department report was well within the expectations of most experts, the new data and other economic figures tended to confirm recent indications that the economy has probably not slowed to any significant degree."
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — The Treasury said today that Taiwan and South Korea were manipulating their currencies to stimulate sales of their goods to the United States, thereby impeding a reduction of the big American trade deficit."
"In a report to Congress on international economic policy, the Treasury also sought to rebuff those economists and international authorities who maintain that the dollar should fall still further. The dollar has fallen about 40 percent since February 1985, when it reached its peak against other major currencies. The dollar’s decline was intended to help narrow the trade deficit, which reached a record $170 billion last year."
"The impact will soon be felt by small businesses, which remain heavily dependent on banks for loans, and by consumers, whose payments on home-equity loans and variable-rate credit cards will rise. Although the higher prime rate could affect consumer spending slightly, it is unlikely to be a major drag on the economy."
"One Day After Testimony The rise in the prime rate came one day after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, indicated to the Senate Banking Committee that he would be prepared to raise interest rates further if inflationary pressures worsen. His remarks, however, implied that he saw no reason to do so now."
"TORONTO, June 19 — Officials of the leading industrial countries sought here today to dispel speculation about a coordinated move toward a substantial increase in world interest rates because of signs of rising inflation."
"This time, however, the official said, American rates have risen a bit this year, while German rates have not risen as much. “But nobody’s saying a tightening of money is going on,” the official added."
Suspicion of a rise in rates coordinated by the leaders of the seven nations attending the economic summit conference has arisen in recent days in world financial markets.
"WASHINGTON, June 14 — In a report that was far better than expected for the second straight month, the Government said today that the nation’s trade deficit shrank 15.5 percent in April, to the lowest monthly point in more than two and a half years."
"Imports, which had remained at stubbornly high levels while their prices in dollars rose, fell sharply in April. Exports slowed only slightly from their recent torrid pace."
"The $9.9 billion trade deficit in April was the smallest since August 1985, when the figure was also $9.9 billion. No monthly level has been lower since the $8 billion of December 1984."
"The April trade deficit was at least $2 billion less than most predictions, and the report set off major rallies in the bond and stock markets and lifted the dollar's value. The latest Commerce Department data seemed, among other things, to make it more likely that inflation could be contained without having to use strong countermeasures involving higher interest rates."
"“It’s a shocker,” said Daniel Friel, an economist, of the trade report. As a result, he sees “very little pressure fori the Federal Reserve to tighten"" because the booming export-oriented manufacturing sector may be getting “some respite” and American consumers seem to be curbing their own demand for goods. Mr. Friel is with the NCNB Corporation, a major bank holding company in the Southeast."
"According to the report, inflation picked up to a 4.7 percent rate during the spring, from 3.5 percent in the first quarter, as measured by the gross national product fixed-weighted price index."
"The report prompted fresh conjecture as to whether the Fed might decide to take yet another step in the series of small ones it has taken this year to raise interest rates, thereby slowing the economy."
"Erratic monthly trade figures make it impossible to read a trend until well after it starts. In monthly reports, the deficit peaked last November, shrank for two months, grew in February and shrank in March. But the reports were raw and incomplete. Only now does the Commerce Department’s quarterly report confirm substantial improvement in the first three months of this year."
"Inflation fears heightened last Friday when the Government reported that producer prices rose in March by six-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since last spring. What happens to prices at the producer level tends to show up in consumer prices several months later."
"The decision is unlikely to have much immediate market impact because it largely ratified the status quo, and because the economic importance of the gray market has declined as the dollar’s value has fallen. Gray market imports are profitable only when foreign businesses sell their products overseas for much less than they sell them in the United States."
"Senator Albert Gore Jr. defines his positions on arms negotiations, the budget deficit and other issues in an interview conducted in advance of the New York State primary election."
"WASHINGTON, April 14 — In a major surprise, the nation’s trade deficit grew sharply to $13.8 billion in February, as imports surged more than, twice as much as exports, the Commerce Department reported today."
"Most economists and participants in the financial markets had expected some improvement, and word of the $1.4 billion widening of the trade gap caused the dollar to plunge and forced world central banks to intervene to restore stability. Bond and stock prices tumbled along a broad front as the dol-( lar declined."
"The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down by 101.46 points, or 4.8 percent. The dramatic fall of stock prices, mainly in the afternoon, reduced the drop in bond prices by half, as many investors sold stocks and switched to more secure fixed-income investments."
"He could start by examining the new “Economic Report of the President,” his very own, beginning on page 32. It asserts that excessively tight monetary policy last year slowed growth, raised interest rates unnecessarily and helped bring down the stock market. The President might also request a copy of a January letter from Michael Darby, Treasury’s chief economist, to each member of the Fed’s Open Market Committee — the system’s policy-making council — arguing for loosening up now."
"In “A New Warning on the Trade Deficit” (editorial, Dec. 11), you sound the alarm over the trade deficit. Financial writers like Leonard Silk (Economic Scene column, Business Day, Dec. 11) warn that in a few years our total indebtedness to foreigners could approach $1 trillion if the trade imbalance continues."
Quite rightly you state that the experts aren’t sure how to fix it. To this conclusion we should add that under our current administration of trade policy there is very little likelihood the situation will improve.
"The stock market lurched downward yesterday as a return of volatile trading ended a fragile, five-day rally."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply from the onset and was down as much as 115 points around 1
"P.M. It later recovered about half its loss, closing the day down 50.56 points, at 1,963.53, a decline of 2.51 percent."
"The tumble was set off in part, market analysts said, by nervous investors who bought in at low prices in the last week and were eager to take profits after the recent rally. A lack of progress in the negotiations in Washington on reducing the Federal budget deficit convinced these investors that the market upswing could not be sustained, the analysts said."
"WASHINGTON, July 2 — The nation’s unemployment rate declined two-tenths of- a percentage point to 6 percent in June, the Labor Department reported today."
"Although the rate has not been so low since late 1979, and in fact had been widely expected to show a slight increase, Government and private analysts agreed that the latest labor market data were considerably weaker than the - unemployment rate itself would suggest."
"The number of Americans with jobs actually declined 198,000, as measured by the department’s survey of households, and for the second straight month business payrolls showed only a lackluster increase."
"“It sort of puts into doubt the strength of the economy at this point,"" commented Maria F. Ramirez, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert."
"EXECUTIVE stock options, like other investment devices tied to the stock market, have been hurt by the October market plunge and accompanying financial turmoil. In fact, the price at which many of these options can be exercised is now much higher than the market price — which is known as being “under water.”"
"Because the exercise price is likely to remain higher for some time, compensation specialists report that companies — many of which are setting up option plans for 1988 — are considering the issuance of new options at lower prices."
"“Unquestionably the vast majority of companies will cancel the outstanding options and issue new ones at lower prices,” said Robert Salmen, a principal and head of executive compansation research at William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm. “We received the first inquiry on this on the Tuesday after the market crash.”"
"! Wall Street, shaken by the turmoil in the stock market, is slamming the brakes on what had been the greatest boom in American financial history. After a decade of unprecedented growth, fueled by a huge flow of profits, a new word is working its way into the financial lexicon: contraction."
"A strangely exuberant, magical era of soaring bonuses, bull markets, an endless flow of billion-dollar deals, multimillion-dollar fees and wholesale migrations from the nation's best business schools to securities houses appears to be coming to a close."
"J.	Lilt, a former securities industry consultant and now the chief financial officer of E. F. Hutton & Company, which announced on Friday that it was laying off 40 people in its municipal bond department. “This is real downsizing. The word for it industrywide really is contraction.”"
"There had even been some layoffs before Black Monday, Oct. 19, as some firms sought to trim their bloated ranks after doubling or even tripling in size over the last five years. The market collapse rattled managers who were unprepared to deal with such huge numbers of people in hard times."
"The Dow Jones industrial average, which has been marching up since August 1982, began a dramatic fall last week that continued through yesterday when it closed at 1,738.74. Shown: Weekly close of the Dow.'	Vi;v y \	yy"
"But today’s economy is better equipped to handle financial shocks. “I don’t see this decline in the stock market leading to a great breakdown in the economy,” said Robert A. Kavesh, a professor of finance and economics at the New York University School of Business. “There are still many elements of strength in the economy — profits are strong, for example.” Among the important differences between today and 1929 are Federal deposit insurance, unemployment insurance and Social Security insurance and other elements of what has come to be known as the safety net. These not only guarantee against widespread destitution; their very existence should also help to prevent the kind of financial panic that fed on itself in the Depression."
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 — The stock market collapse forced the impossible: a summit meeting between the White House and Congress on a deficit-reducing package."
"The talks are floundering because the White House and Congressional negotiators remain deeply divided over the same tax issues and military and domestic spending priorities they have fought over since 1981, and because pressure from constituents on the issue has been minimal."
"RUSSELL, Kan., Nov. 9 — Calling himself a candidate of America's heartland, Senator Bob Dole returned to his prairie hometown today to formally announce that he is a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination. He put erasing the budget deficit at the heart of his Presidency."
At the same time Mr. Dole pledged to “tackle the runaway Federal budget head-on” through cuts in Federal spending except for those programs that “assist vulnerable Americans.” He vowed not to raise tax rates and said his fundamental goal was a balanced budget.
"NEWARK, July 10 — For 12 years, Nona Payton worked as a claims clerk in unemployment offices. Soon, she will return — as a client."
"Other workers have seen their salaries cut by as much as $10,000 a year because their positions were taken over by employees with higher Civil Service classifications who lost their positions through reorganization."
Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that it had lost $250 million this month because bonds that it owned plummeted in value when interest rates surged.
I Wall Street executives could not re-[ call an occasion when a securities firm lost so much in so short a time — ap-I parently little more than a week.
"j In the last few weeks the bond markets have been particularly turbulent, and one sector, municipal bonds, took its worst drubbing in years. The individual investors who dominate the tax-exempt market suffered losses of about 10percent. |Page Dl.]"
"Merrill’s losses came from $1.7 billion in transactions involving complex and volatile mortgage-backed bonds, according to officials at the firm and other Wall Street sources. Those trans-| actions went awry when those bonds tumbled in value."
"J.	Bennett has led the charge, accusing colleges of being greedy in pushing up tuitions at rates that reach double digits in some cases, and that far exceed increases for food, automobiles and other goods and services. At some top private schools, costs for 1987-88 will approach $18,000 per student."
"Stung by the accusations of • greed and inefficiency, the colleges and universities are striking back, arguing that, in an industry in which greater efficiency cannot be equated with personnel cutbacks, some of their costs necessarily go up faster than inflation."
"The Republic National Bank in New York at 4 P.M. quoted gold bullion at $447.00 an ounce, down $5.50 from Monday’s late bid."
Stock prices sulrged and interest rates tumbled yesterday as investors became increasingly optimistic that inflation has been checked.
"Stocks rose to record levels, with the the Dow Jones industrial average closing above 1,700 for the first time. It rose 17.09 points, to 1,713.99, in what was the fifth-busiest session in New York Stock Exchange history. The average moved past 1,600 as recently as Feb. 6."
"In the same three weeks, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have fallen by a percentage point, to 8.29 percent, a remarkably sudden drop for the benchmark issue. Bond prices have risen 11 points during the three weeks, or $110 per $1,000 bond."
"finally setting aside their memories of 1979 and 1980, when inflation exceeded 10 percent and the bond markets were a disaster zone. Inflation causes havoc in the bond markets as investors demand higher interest rates to protect the value of their securities. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. With yesterday’s decline in rates, bond prices soared."
"Interest rates stayed high in recent years because of investor nervousness that inflation might be rekindled. But now, after four years of inflation at 4 percent or less, and with important drops in oil prices pointing to a rate of 3 percent or less this year, investors are buying bonds with yields that would have been unthinkable just months ago."
"The reduction, the third this year, brought the crucial discount rate to its lowest level since the start of 1978."
"The discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges on loans it makes to financial institutions, normally leads to widespread declines of interest rates charged businesses and consumers. The declines, in turn, tend to enliven the economy by encouraging individuals and corporations to borrow more and spend more."
"Earlier this year the Federal Reserve reduced the discount rate twice to stimulate the economy. On March 7 the rate was cut to 7 percent from 7>4 percent. Six weeks later, on April 18, the rate was cut to 6*4 percent."
"Commenting on the national figures, Larry M. Speakes, the White House spokesman, said “the continuing good economic news will add considerably to real consumer purchasing power.’’ “There will be more money in Americans’ pockets,” he added, ’to buy more goods and services at lower prices.”"
"America’s foreign trade deficit roars on at a record clip. Domestic growth has slowed and pressure mounts for unilateral protection against imports. The Reagan Administration, floundering in a mess of its own making, pleads for patience at home while it tries to force other governments to sell less to us and buy more from us. Getting into this jam was easy. Getting out won’t be."
"To support his case against the rigidity of quotas, White House negotiators have meanwhile scurried to show that they can fend off disruptive imports without new legislation. In the last seven days, they have completed renegotiation of the expiring 54-nation pact that controls textile trade, struck a separate new textile deal with South Africa, and concluded an agreement with Japan on computer chips."
"Textiles and chips are important but they are just part of the trade problem. Total imports exceeded exports by a record $14$ billion last year. The 1986 gap will almost surely be larger. To the Administration’s chagrin, the Commerce Department has just reported the June deficit, $14.2 billion, changed little from May."
"lar soared until it started down again a year ago. The Administration shrugged off the high value of the dollar, claiming that it just showed America’s “strength.” But that “strong” dollar pushed American goods out of foreign markets, brought more foreign goods into American markets, wiped out factory jobs and devastated farmers. Now that the dollar’s value has dropped, imports should drop and exports strengthen. But there’s a long lag because of goods already in the pipeline at the old prices. Some business, in any case, is gone forever."
The recent sharp decline owes much to cut-rate financing offered by Detroit on new cars. The borrowing to pay for them severely affected the personal savings rate.
"But even if the plunge turns out to be an aberration, it would provide little comfort to many economists, because they view the longer-term savings rate as insufficient, too. What concerns them is the suspicion that what is holding American savings at levels well below those of many other countries are changes in both the profile of the population and the overall economy."
Interest rates on Treasury securities rose yesterday for the fourth consecutive trading day as securities dealers vainly tried to attract buyers for the large amount of notes and bonds they hold in inventory.
The reluctance of many investors to purchase recently offered Treasury securities — particularly longterm issues due In 10 years and more — is widely attributed to fears that the Federal Reserve will begin to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates by spring.
"Despite statements Wednesday by Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that monetary policy was not being tightened, many investors are willing to stay on the sidelines because they expect interest rates to rise and bond prices to fall later in the year."
"“Volcker must have known about the stronger G.N.P. numbers and money supply rise on Wednesday when he said that monetary policy was not being tightened,” one government securities dealer said. “The concern in the market is not with what the Fed is doing today or tomorrow but what will the Fed be doing several weeks from now.”"
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 — Reflecting a surge in imports of cars, clothing, steel and other manufactured goods, the United States trade deficit grew to a record $15.5 billion in September, the Commerce Department said today."
"The trade deficit, which narrowed in July and August, widened in September despite a 17 percent depreciation of the dollar since February."
"With a slight shift to the easier side, the composite rate showed a reduction of 0.45 point in contrast to the sharp gain in the preceding session. Active market observers called it a technical reaction; those with a more realistic approach branded it one born of extreme caution."
"Trading in the motors accounted for an increase in business on the Stock Exchange where transfers reached 2,480,000 shares, against 2,200,000 shares on Monday. And, of the 1,178 issues dealt, 468 declined while 419 showed grains."
"Chrysler still drew some support from the persistent rumors in Wall Street of a stock split and the ‘ rumor mongers"". in the downtown section provided added fuel to the automotive division, as General Motors topped the market in volume on 51,400 shares and with a slight advantage of % point at 50. Whereas Packard slipped % point to a rate of 4, Chrysler made a new gain of a point to end at 79."
"For tne nrteentn consecutive month the case load rose-, Mr. Hilliard noted. The latest upturn was from 136,440 cases in January to 169,645 in February. A total of 345,708 persons received public assistance last month, an increase of 9,087 over January."
"Commissioner Hilliard said that the increased case load was a result of unemployment that continued high and that was reflected in a rate of almost 3,500 applications weekly."
"A large army of unemployed, he said, constitutes “a reservoir from which new applicants are continuously flowing."" Each week sees more persons exhausting first their unemployment insurance and then their savings, after which they turn to the Welfare Department for support, the Commissioner explained."
"F. Raymond Peterson, retiring president of the association, in a press interview at the hotel during the afternoon, termed the conflict between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury ""unfortunate."" The Federal Reserve, which favors higher rates as an anti-inf . ary influence, recently acted to increase the rediscount rate to l‘ t per cent, while the Treasury insisted on refunding its maturing obligations at l'i per cent."
"The market managed to regain some of its poise shortly thereafter only to be hit by another flurry of sales in the closing period. At the close, losses ranged from 1 to 5 points in the extreme with the comp6site rate reduced by 1.27 points. In effect, the share list was only a point above the low set on June 30."
Televisions were the hardest hit in terms of price reductions—probably on the theory that any order for a shift to war-time blue-print for industry would limit an opportunity for increasing profits. The pattern was not uniform nor in adherence to what might develop for various industries in the case of all-out war mobilization.
"A smattering of individual stocks managed to show some gains in excess of a point but losses of fractions generally ruled, with the composite rate down 0.04 point. Business continued to shrink from the high levels of recent weeks, with transfers of 2,340,000 shares on the Stock Exchange, compared with"
"The rails were affected by the spreading of the railroad strike which threatened to cripple transportation in key sections of the country, although some units continued to advance in response to favorable corporate developments such as earnings, stock split proposals and dividend increases. Major commodity markets remained closed and served as an added reason for unrest in the share list. Taxes, however, loomed as the most important problem ahead for market consideration."

"WASHINGTON, July 2 —No one knows at this juncture what kind of anti-inflation controls will be voted by Congress, to take effect after the extension to Aug. 1 of present regulations -has expired. The millions of unorganized citizens who are principally consumers, meaning they have nothing to sell but their services, may by then have exercised pressure on Congress which will counterbalance that successfully applied thus far by representatives of the meat, textile and commodity interests. Or world events,, including the armistice negotiations in Korea, may have increased the anti-controls trend of Congress beyond the high point reached in the bill passed by the Senate early last Friday morning."
"The possibility that this could be the consequence of any global good news, however clearly temporary its quality, was emphasized by the fact that, before the month’s extension of the old law was granted to the Executive by Congress, the House (the Senate concurring) gave the Administration an extra and stinging rebuff by prohibiting price rollbacks of any kind during the period."
"Like other provisions which fundamentally limit the regulatory powers-of the Executive over the economy, this was the work of one of the Presidents fellow-Democrats, Representative Cooley of North Carolina, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And its consideration at that point was made possible by the House Rules Committee, which Mr. Truman's party colleagues control two to one. Such incidents serve to illuminate an aspect of the battle over controls as striking in its way as the success of the lobbies was in another. This second manifestation was the opposition to major items in the Administration’s anti-inflption program by the Democratic leaders in Congress."
"HARRIMAN, N. Y., May 19-Leaders of a cross-section of American life expressed disagreement today as towether the nation would face inflation or recession before the end of this year."

"The conferees, who assembled yesterday at Arden House, the ninety-six room manor house presented to Columbia University by W. Averell Harriman, divided today into three panels that met in closed sessions to discuss the direction and extent of this country’s fiscal problems and what to do about them."
"Dr. Benjamin H. Beckhart, Professor of Banking at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, chairman of one of the three round tables, disclosed that the meetings were eliciting a wide diversity of opinion among business, agricultural, labor and industrial leaders and representatives of the professions as to the nature of the problem ahead and ways of attempting its solution."
"From individual participants, who preferred to remain anonymous, a composite picture of the divergent opinion was obtained. One school' of thought held that the present softening of wholesale prices would be reversed by the fall of this year and that inflation would ascend into 1953 as a result of increased Government expenditures for war, and domestic developments that would put more money into the hands of more persons and diminish the available supply of consumer goods."
"Most prices, however, are high even by American standards because most of the goods, being in the so-called luxury category, are burdened with the purchase tax, which ranges from 33-1/3 to 100 per cent."
The second consecutive new high for the year was reached yesterday by the stock market in an extension of the creeping advance. Fur-ther demand for the railroad issues was the main prop for the list;
"Gains ranged from fractions to1 more than a point in a variety of stocks with firmness most pronounced, aside from the carriers. In the motors, metis and airlines."
"Measured by The New York Times index, the composite rate advanced 0.79 point but gains in the rails far exceeded the average. The rails and a few special issues accounted for a rise in the volume on the Stock Exchange to 1,180,-000 shares, from 1,140,000 shares on Wednesday. It was the heaviest turnover so far this month. .In-] terest broadened on the advance] to include 1,088 issues. At the close, 485 showed gains, 297 losses and 306 held unchanged."
"Bernard M. Barucli accused the Administration yesterday of .fomenting inflation : through .

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 16—The Consumers Price Index dropped 0.2 per cent in the month from mid-November to mid-December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. This latest recession was due principally to a drop of 1 per cent in food prices. The over-all index figure fell to 190.7 from 191.1."
"The Bureau’s ""old series’’ index, which directly affects the wage rates of millions of employes, dropped even more, 0.3 per cent. The figure for this index was 191, down from 191.6."
"Some of the revisions were included in an ""interim adjusted"" index which the Bureau has been publishing for the last two years. This is the index which dropped"
"Back in early April, when the news showed that prospects were increasing for a resumption of full-scale armistice negotiations in Korea, the stock market here went through a pretty bad time. In one trading session alone, that of Monday, April 6, selling became so general that the volume of trading crossed the 3,000,000 mark for the first time since early 1951."
"WASHINGTON, May 29—Retail! sales continued to gain momentum this month and by the end of the third week stood at 7 per cent above the levels prevailing a year ago, the Federal Reserve Board reported today in its monthly summary of business conditions. The improvement was in spite of a leveling off of industrial production noticeable in April and May."
"According to the board, industrial production, which was at 243 on the agency’s index (based on 1935-1939=100) in March, dropped to 242 in April, where it'remained through the early weeks of this month. The April-May level of activity is still 15 per cent above that of May, 1952.."
Organized industry struck yesterday at the principal prop supporting organized labor’s demands for higher wages this year. The National Association of Manufacturers asserted that the ben- efits of increased industrial productivity should be distributed in the form of lower prices for all Americans rather than fatter pay envelopes for workers in unionized industries.
"With the cost of Jiving edging downward for the first time since the start of the Korean war, major unions have been transferring their emphasis from living costs to productivity in calling for a new round of wage increases in 1B53."

"Mr. Eccles was one of the earliest and most vocal exponents of the compensatory budget. He argued for it, as a matter of fact, when the magnitude of the federal debt was so small, by present standards, that the case for such a fiscal policy was, in the opinion of many persons, dubious. Today, with a federal debt of more than a quarter of a trillion dollars, no one has to be reminded that the manner in which the debt and the budget are managed can have important repercussions on the economy and on the business cycle. Whatever may have t>een said for the compensatory budget theory twenty years ago, events in the form of a world war, a minor war and several years of postwar inflation have given it a sort of fortuitous validity which, whether we like it or not, is at the moment hardly arguable."

"■ “The budget is a major determinant as to whether this country moves, toward' inflation or deflation,” he said. “When we came in, the deficit was $9,500,-000,000 and increasing.. The budget was set for inflation. The budget his been cut in 1952-53 by $10,000,000,000; and the cut on, the planned • .1953-54 budget will be $14,000,000,000."

"The total employed during the survey week early in June of this year was estimated at 62,098,000, compared with 61,119,Q00 a month earlier."
"J Although unemployment usually decreases in March, last month’s increase was interpreted by Government officials as a sraal} one and as a sign that the trend was “leveling off.”"
"Meanwhile, the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Employment Security reported that, for the week ended March 27, new claims for unemployment compensation had declined by 1,000 to a total of 292,700. The decline continued a trend that had started at the beginning of March."
March 1—United Nations economists put forward a warning today that Western Europe might not he able to meet the shock of a deepened recession in the United States.
"Western Europe’s economic health, showed signs of a “hesitant” recovery in 1953, the economists said. But some of the important developments that make for a more robust economy on the Continent are directly tied to conditions in the United States, the economists added."

Forecasts in the gas utilities field indicate a reduction of about 30 per cent in :1954 expenditures for production land transmission."

"In a collapse ascribed to the illness of President Eisen-| hower, the stock market yesterday suffered its heaviest dollar; lods in history. With most leaders losing 4 to 8 points a share,; and one as much as 33 %, the value of New York Stock Exchange stocks lost approximately $14,000,000,000, half their 1955 gain.

"The decisions being made right now by business executives will 'have a great deal to do with the duration of the present boom, Mr. Balderston declared, adding: “Unless the quality of this decision making reflects prudent judgment as well as *. reasonably well-founded appraisal of present and future needs, executives will make mistakes for, which they and their workers and investors will pay the penalty. What I am arguing for is that executives should risk, neither too little nor too much. They should be willing to venture, but still guard against too much optimism.’’	I"
